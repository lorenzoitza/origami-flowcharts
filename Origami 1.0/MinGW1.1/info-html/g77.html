<h1>GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</h1>

<p align="center">Version 2, June 1991</p>

<pre>Copyright &copy; 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307, USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
</pre>

<h2>Preamble</h2>

<p>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

<p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

<p>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. 
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

<p>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

<p>We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

<p>Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

<p>Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

<p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

<p align="center">TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</p>

<ol type=1 start=0>
</p><li>This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

<p>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). 
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

</p><li>You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

<p>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

</p><li>You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

<ol type=a start=1>
<li>You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

<li>You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
parties under the terms of this License.

<li>If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
</ol>

<p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

<p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

<p>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

</p><li>You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

<ol type=a start=1>
<li>Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

<li>Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
customarily used for software interchange; or,

<li>Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
received the program in object code or executable form with such
an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
</ol>

<p>The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

<p>If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

</p><li>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. 
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

<li>You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

<li>Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. 
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

<li>If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

<p>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

<p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

<p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

</p><li>If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

<li>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

<p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

</p><li>If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

<p align="center">NO WARRANTY</p>

<li>BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

<li>IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
</ol>

<p align="center">END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p>

<h2>How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</h2>

<p>If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

<p>To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

<pre><var>one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.</var>
Copyright (C) 19<var>yy</var>  <var>name of author</var>

This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
(at your option) any later version.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
GNU General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307, USA.
</pre>

<p>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

<p>If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

<pre>Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19<var>yy</var> <var>name of author</var>
Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details
type `show w'.
This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
</pre>

<p>The hypothetical commands <code>show w</code> and <code>show c</code> should show
the appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the
commands you use may be called something other than <code>show w</code> and
<code>show c</code>; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever
suits your program.

<p>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

<pre>Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
`Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

<var>signature of Ty Coon</var>, 1 April 1989
Ty Coon, President of Vice
</pre>

<p>This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
Public License instead of this License.

<h1>Contributors to GNU Fortran</h1>

<p>In addition to James Craig Burley, who wrote the front end,
many people have helped create and improve GNU Fortran.

<ul>
<li>The packaging and compiler portions of GNU Fortran are based largely
on the GNU CC compiler. 
See <a href="gcc.html#Contributors%20to%20GNU%20CC">Contributors</a>,
for more information.

<li>The run-time library used by GNU Fortran is a repackaged version
of the <code>libf2c</code> library (combined from the <code>libF77</code> and
<code>libI77</code> libraries) provided as part of <code>f2c</code>, available for
free from <code>netlib</code> sites on the Internet.

<li>Cygnus Support and The Free Software Foundation contributed
significant money and/or equipment to Craig's efforts.

<li>The following individuals served as alpha testers prior to <code>g77</code>'s
public release.  This work consisted of testing, researching, sometimes
debugging, and occasionally providing small amounts of code and fixes
for <code>g77</code>, plus offering plenty of helpful advice to Craig:

<ul>
<li>Jonathan Corbet
<li>Dr. Mark Fernyhough
<li>Takafumi Hayashi (The University of Aizu)--<a href="mailto:takafumi@u-aizu.ac.jp">takafumi@u-aizu.ac.jp</a>
<li>Kate Hedstrom
<li>Michel Kern (INRIA and Rice University)--<a href="mailto:Michel.Kern@inria.fr">Michel.Kern@inria.fr</a>
<li>Dr. A. O. V. Le Blanc
<li>Dave Love
<li>Rick Lutowski
<li>Toon Moene
<li>Rick Niles
<li>Derk Reefman
<li>Wayne K. Schroll
<li>Bill Thorson
<li>Pedro A. M. Vazquez
<li>Ian Watson
</ul>

<li>Scott Snyder (<a href="mailto:snyder@d0sgif.fnal.gov">snyder@d0sgif.fnal.gov</a>)
provided the patch to add rudimentary support
for <code>INTEGER*1</code>, <code>INTEGER*2</code>, and
<code>LOGICAL*1</code>. 
This inspired Craig to add further support,
even though the resulting support
would still be incomplete, because version 0.6 is still
a ways off.

<li>David Ronis (<a href="mailto:ronis@onsager.chem.mcgill.ca">ronis@onsager.chem.mcgill.ca</a>) inspired
and encouraged Craig to rewrite the documentation in texinfo
format by contributing a first pass at a translation of the
old <code>g77-0.5.16/f/DOC</code> file.

<li>Toon Moene (<a href="mailto:toon@moene.indiv.nluug.nl">toon@moene.indiv.nluug.nl</a>) performed
some analysis of generated code as part of an overall project
to improve <code>g77</code> code generation to at least be as good
as <code>f2c</code> used in conjunction with <code>gcc</code>. 
So far, this has resulted in the three, somewhat
experimental, options added by <code>g77</code> to the <code>gcc</code>
compiler and its back end.

<p>(These, in turn, have made their way into the <code>egcs</code>
version of the compiler, and do not exist in <code>gcc</code>
version 2.8 or versions of <code>g77</code> based on that version
of <code>gcc</code>.)

</p><li>John Carr (<a href="mailto:jfc@mit.edu">jfc@mit.edu</a>) wrote the alias analysis improvements.

<li>Thanks to Mary Cortani and the staff at Craftwork Solutions
(<a href="mailto:support@craftwork.com">support@craftwork.com</a>) for all of their support.

<li>Many other individuals have helped debug, test, and improve <code>g77</code>
over the past several years, and undoubtedly more people
will be doing so in the future. 
If you have done so, and would like
to see your name listed in the above list, please ask! 
The default is that people wish to remain anonymous.

<h1>Funding Free Software</h1>

<p>If you want to have more free software a few years from now, it makes
sense for you to help encourage people to contribute funds for its
development.  The most effective approach known is to encourage
commercial redistributors to donate.

<p>Users of free software systems can boost the pace of development by
encouraging for-a-fee distributors to donate part of their selling price
to free software developers--the Free Software Foundation, and others.

<p>The way to convince distributors to do this is to demand it and expect
it from them.  So when you compare distributors, judge them partly by
how much they give to free software development.  Show distributors
they must compete to be the one who gives the most.

<p>To make this approach work, you must insist on numbers that you can
compare, such as, "We will donate ten dollars to the Frobnitz project
for each disk sold."  Don't be satisfied with a vague promise, such as
"A portion of the profits are donated," since it doesn't give a basis
for comparison.

<p>Even a precise fraction "of the profits from this disk" is not very
meaningful, since creative accounting and unrelated business decisions
can greatly alter what fraction of the sales price counts as profit. 
If the price you pay is $50, ten percent of the profit is probably
less than a dollar; it might be a few cents, or nothing at all.

<p>Some redistributors do development work themselves.  This is useful too;
but to keep everyone honest, you need to inquire how much they do, and
what kind.  Some kinds of development make much more long-term
difference than others.  For example, maintaining a separate version of
a program contributes very little; maintaining the standard version of a
program for the whole community contributes much.  Easy new ports
contribute little, since someone else would surely do them; difficult
ports such as adding a new CPU to the GNU C compiler contribute more;
major new features or packages contribute the most.

<p>By establishing the idea that supporting further development is "the
proper thing to do" when distributing free software for a fee, we can
assure a steady flow of resources into making more free software.

<h1>Funding GNU Fortran</h1>

<p>Work on GNU Fortran is still being done mostly by its author,
James Craig Burley (<a href="mailto:craig@jcb-sc.com">craig@jcb-sc.com</a>), who is a volunteer
for, not an employee of, the Free Software Foundation (FSF). 
(He has a web page at <a href="http://world.std.com/%7Eburley">http://world.std.com/%7Eburley</a>.)

<p>As with other GNU software, funding is important because it can pay for
needed equipment, personnel, and so on.

<p>The FSF provides information on the best way to fund ongoing
development of GNU software (such as GNU Fortran) in documents
such as the "GNUS Bulletin". 
Email <a href="mailto:gnu@gnu.org">gnu@gnu.org</a> for information on funding the FSF.

<p>To fund specific GNU Fortran work in particular, the FSF might
provide a means for that, but the FSF does not provide direct funding
to the author of GNU Fortran to continue his work.  The FSF has
employee salary restrictions that can be incompatible with the
financial needs of some volunteers, who therefore choose to
remain volunteers and thus be able to be free to do contract work
and otherwise make their own schedules for doing GNU work.

<p>Still, funding the FSF at least indirectly benefits work
on specific projects like GNU Fortran because it ensures the
continuing operation of the FSF offices, their workstations, their
network connections, and so on, which are invaluable to volunteers. 
(Similarly, hiring Cygnus Support can help a project like GNU
Fortran--Cygnus has been a long-time donor of equipment usage to the author
of GNU Fortran, and this too has been invaluable--see <a href="#Contributors">Contributors</a>.)

<p>Currently, the only way to directly fund the author of GNU Fortran
in his work on that project is to hire him for the work you want
him to do, or donate money to him. 
Several people have done this
already, with the result that he has not needed to immediately find
contract work on a few occasions. 
If more people did this, he
would be able to plan on not doing contract work for many months and
could thus devote that time to work on projects (such as the planned
changes for 0.6) that require longer timeframes to complete. 
For the latest information on the status of the author, do
<kbd>finger -l burley@gnu.org</kbd> on a UNIX system
(or any system with a command like UNIX <code>finger</code>).

<p>Another important way to support work on GNU Fortran is to volunteer
to help out. 
Work is needed on documentation, testing, porting
to various machines, and in some cases, coding (although major
changes planned for version 0.6 make it difficult to add manpower to this
area). 
Email <a href="mailto:gcc@gcc.gnu.org">gcc@gcc.gnu.org</a> to volunteer for this work.

<h1>What is GNU Fortran?</h1>

<p>GNU Fortran, or <code>g77</code>, is designed initially as a free replacement
for, or alternative to, the UNIX <code>f77</code> command. 
(Similarly, <code>gcc</code> is designed as a replacement
for the UNIX <code>cc</code> command.)

<p><code>g77</code> also is designed to fit in well with the other
fine GNU compilers and tools.

<p>Sometimes these design goals conflict--in such cases, resolution
often is made in favor of fitting in well with Project GNU. 
These cases are usually identified in the appropriate
sections of this manual.

<p>As compilers, <code>g77</code>, <code>gcc</code>, and <code>f77</code>
share the following characteristics:

<ul>
<li>They read a user's program, stored in a file and
containing instructions written in the appropriate
language (Fortran, C, and so on). 
This file contains <dfn>source code</dfn>.

<li>They translate the user's program into instructions
a computer can carry out more quickly than it takes
to translate the instructions in the first place. 
These instructions are called <dfn>machine code</dfn>--code
designed to be efficiently translated and processed
by a machine such as a computer. 
Humans usually aren't as good writing machine code
as they are at writing Fortran or C, because
it is easy to make tiny mistakes writing machine code. 
When writing Fortran or C, it is easy
to make big mistakes.

<li>They provide information in the generated machine code
that can make it easier to find bugs in the program
(using a debugging tool, called a <dfn>debugger</dfn>,
such as <code>gdb</code>).

<li>They locate and gather machine code already generated
to perform actions requested by statements in
the user's program. 
This machine code is organized
into <dfn>libraries</dfn> and is located and gathered
during the <dfn>link</dfn> phase of the compilation
process. 
(Linking often is thought of as a separate
step, because it can be directly invoked via the
<code>ld</code> command. 
However, the <code>g77</code> and <code>gcc</code>
commands, as with most compiler commands, automatically
perform the linking step by calling on <code>ld</code>
directly, unless asked to not do so by the user.)

<li>They attempt to diagnose cases where the user's
program contains incorrect usages of the language. 
The <dfn>diagnostics</dfn> produced by the compiler
indicate the problem and the location in the user's
source file where the problem was first noticed. 
The user can use this information to locate and
fix the problem. 
(Sometimes an incorrect usage
of the language leads to a situation where the
compiler can no longer make any sense of what
follows--while a human might be able to--and
thus ends up complaining about many "problems"
it encounters that, in fact, stem from just one
problem, usually the first one reported.)

<li>They attempt to diagnose cases where the user's
program contains a correct usage of the language,
but instructs the computer to do something questionable. 
These diagnostics often are in the form of <dfn>warnings</dfn>,
instead of the <dfn>errors</dfn> that indicate incorrect
usage of the language. 
</ul>

<p>How these actions are performed is generally under the
control of the user. 
Using command-line options, the user can specify
how persnickety the compiler is to be regarding
the program (whether to diagnose questionable usage
of the language), how much time to spend making
the generated machine code run faster, and so on.

<p><code>g77</code> consists of several components:

<ul>
<li>A modified version of the <code>gcc</code> command, which also might be
installed as the system's <code>cc</code> command. 
(In many cases, <code>cc</code> refers to the
system's "native" C compiler, which
might be a non-GNU compiler, or an older version
of <code>gcc</code> considered more stable or that is
used to build the operating system kernel.)

<li>The <code>g77</code> command itself, which also might be installed as the
system's <code>f77</code> command.

<li>The <code>libg2c</code> run-time library. 
This library contains the machine code needed to support
capabilities of the Fortran language that are not directly
provided by the machine code generated by the <code>g77</code>
compilation phase.

<p><code>libg2c</code> is just the unique name <code>g77</code> gives
to its version of <code>libf2c</code> to distinguish it from
any copy of <code>libf2c</code> installed from <code>f2c</code>
(or versions of <code>g77</code> that built <code>libf2c</code> under
that same name)
on the system.

<p>The maintainer of <code>libf2c</code> currently is
<a href="mailto:dmg@bell-labs.com">dmg@bell-labs.com</a>.

</p><li>The compiler itself, internally named <code>f771</code>.

<p>Note that <code>f771</code> does not generate machine code directly--it
generates <dfn>assembly code</dfn> that is a more readable form
of machine code, leaving the conversion to actual machine code
to an <dfn>assembler</dfn>, usually named <code>as</code>. 
</ul>

<p><code>gcc</code> is often thought of as "the C compiler" only,
but it does more than that. 
Based on command-line options and the names given for files
on the command line, <code>gcc</code> determines which actions to perform, including
preprocessing, compiling (in a variety of possible languages), assembling,
and linking.

<p>For example, the command <code>gcc foo.c</code> <dfn>drives</dfn> the file
<code>foo.c</code> through the preprocessor <code>cpp</code>, then
the C compiler (internally named
<code>cc1</code>), then the assembler (usually <code>as</code>), then the linker
(<code>ld</code>), producing an executable program named <code>a.out</code> (on
UNIX systems).

<p>As another example, the command <code>gcc foo.cc</code> would do much the same as
<code>gcc foo.c</code>, but instead of using the C compiler named <code>cc1</code>,
<code>gcc</code> would use the C++ compiler (named <code>cc1plus</code>).

<p>In a GNU Fortran installation, <code>gcc</code> recognizes Fortran source
files by name just like it does C and C++ source files. 
It knows to use the Fortran compiler named <code>f771</code>, instead of
<code>cc1</code> or <code>cc1plus</code>, to compile Fortran files.

<p>Non-Fortran-related operation of <code>gcc</code> is generally
unaffected by installing the GNU Fortran version of <code>gcc</code>. 
However, without the installed version of <code>gcc</code> being the
GNU Fortran version, <code>gcc</code> will not be able to compile
and link Fortran programs--and since <code>g77</code> uses <code>gcc</code>
to do most of the actual work, neither will <code>g77</code>!

<p>The <code>g77</code> command is essentially just a front-end for
the <code>gcc</code> command. 
Fortran users will normally use <code>g77</code> instead of <code>gcc</code>,
because <code>g77</code>
knows how to specify the libraries needed to link with Fortran programs
(<code>libg2c</code> and <code>lm</code>). 
<code>g77</code> can still compile and link programs and
source files written in other languages, just like <code>gcc</code>.

<p>The command <code>g77 -v</code> is a quick
way to display lots of version information for the various programs
used to compile a typical preprocessed Fortran source file--this
produces much more output than <code>gcc -v</code> currently does. 
(If it produces an error message near the end of the output--diagnostics
from the linker, usually <code>ld</code>--you might
have an out-of-date <code>libf2c</code> that improperly handles
complex arithmetic.) 
In the output of this command, the line beginning <code>GNU Fortran Front
End</code> identifies the version number of GNU Fortran; immediately
preceding that line is a line identifying the version of <code>gcc</code>
with which that version of <code>g77</code> was built.

<p>The <code>libf2c</code> library is distributed with GNU Fortran for
the convenience of its users, but is not part of GNU Fortran. 
It contains the procedures
needed by Fortran programs while they are running.

<p>For example, while code generated by <code>g77</code> is likely
to do additions, subtractions, and multiplications <dfn>in line</dfn>--in
the actual compiled code--it is not likely to do trigonometric
functions this way.

<p>Instead, operations like trigonometric
functions are compiled by the <code>f771</code> compiler
(invoked by <code>g77</code> when compiling Fortran code) into machine
code that, when run, calls on functions in <code>libg2c</code>, so
<code>libg2c</code> must be linked with almost every useful program
having any component compiled by GNU Fortran. 
(As mentioned above, the <code>g77</code> command takes
care of all this for you.)

<p>The <code>f771</code> program represents most of what is unique to GNU Fortran. 
While much of the <code>libg2c</code> component comes from
the <code>libf2c</code> component of <code>f2c</code>,
a free Fortran-to-C converter distributed by Bellcore (AT&amp;T),
plus <code>libU77</code>, provided by Dave Love,
and the <code>g77</code> command is just a small front-end to <code>gcc</code>,
<code>f771</code> is a combination of two rather
large chunks of code.

<p>One chunk is the so-called <dfn>GNU Back End</dfn>, or GBE,
which knows how to generate fast code for a wide variety of processors. 
The same GBE is used by the C, C++, and Fortran compiler programs <code>cc1</code>,
<code>cc1plus</code>, and <code>f771</code>, plus others. 
Often the GBE is referred to as the "gcc back end" or
even just "gcc"--in this manual, the term GBE is used
whenever the distinction is important.

<p>The other chunk of <code>f771</code> is the
majority of what is unique about GNU Fortran--the code that knows how
to interpret Fortran programs to determine what they are intending to
do, and then communicate that knowledge to the GBE for actual compilation
of those programs. 
This chunk is called the <dfn>Fortran Front End</dfn> (FFE). 
The <code>cc1</code> and <code>cc1plus</code> programs have their own front ends,
for the C and C++ languages, respectively. 
These fronts ends are responsible for diagnosing
incorrect usage of their respective languages by the
programs the process, and are responsible for most of
the warnings about questionable constructs as well. 
(The GBE handles producing some warnings, like those
concerning possible references to undefined variables.)

<p>Because so much is shared among the compilers for various languages,
much of the behavior and many of the user-selectable options for these
compilers are similar. 
For example, diagnostics (error messages and
warnings) are similar in appearance; command-line
options like <code>-Wall</code> have generally similar effects; and the quality
of generated code (in terms of speed and size) is roughly similar
(since that work is done by the shared GBE).

<h1>Compile Fortran, C, or Other Programs</h1>

<p>A GNU Fortran installation includes a modified version of the <code>gcc</code>
command.

<p>In a non-Fortran installation, <code>gcc</code> recognizes C, C++,
and Objective-C source files.

<p>In a GNU Fortran installation, <code>gcc</code> also recognizes Fortran source
files and accepts Fortran-specific command-line options, plus some
command-line options that are designed to cater to Fortran users
but apply to other languages as well.

<p>See <a href="gcc.html#Compile%20C%3b%20C++%3b%20or%20Objective-C">G++ and GCC</a>,
for information on the way different languages are handled
by the GNU CC compiler (<code>gcc</code>).

<p>Also provided as part of GNU Fortran is the <code>g77</code> command. 
The <code>g77</code> command is designed to make compiling and linking Fortran
programs somewhat easier than when using the <code>gcc</code> command for
these tasks. 
It does this by analyzing the command line somewhat and changing it
appropriately before submitting it to the <code>gcc</code> command.

<p>Use the <code>-v</code> option with <code>g77</code>
to see what is going on--the first line of output is the invocation
of the <code>gcc</code> command.

<h1>GNU Fortran Command Options</h1>

<p>The <code>g77</code> command supports all the options supported by the
<code>gcc</code> command. 
See <a href="gcc.html#GNU%20CC%20Command%20Options">Invoking GCC</a>,
for information
on the non-Fortran-specific aspects of the <code>gcc</code> command (and,
therefore, the <code>g77</code> command).

<p>All <code>gcc</code> and <code>g77</code> options
are accepted both by <code>g77</code> and by <code>gcc</code>
(as well as any other drivers built at the same time,
such as <code>g++</code>),
since adding <code>g77</code> to the <code>gcc</code> distribution
enables acceptance of <code>g77</code>-specific options
by all of the relevant drivers.

<p>In some cases, options have positive and negative forms;
the negative form of <code>-ffoo</code> would be <code>-fno-foo</code>. 
This manual documents only one of these two forms, whichever
one is not the default.

<h2>Options Controlling the Kind of Output</h2>

<p>Compilation can involve as many as four stages: preprocessing, code
generation (often what is really meant by the term "compilation"),
assembly, and linking, always in that order.  The first three
stages apply to an individual source file, and end by producing an
object file; linking combines all the object files (those newly
compiled, and those specified as input) into an executable file.

<p>For any given input file, the file name suffix determines what kind of
program is contained in the file--that is, the language in which the
program is written is generally indicated by the suffix. 
Suffixes specific to GNU Fortran are listed below. 
See <a href="Using and Porting GNU CC.html#gcc">Overall Options</a>, for
information on suffixes recognized by GNU CC.

<dl>
<dt><code><var>file</var>.f</code>
<br><dt><code><var>file</var>.for</code>
<br><dt><code><var>file</var>.FOR</code>
<dd>Fortran source code that should not be preprocessed.

<p>Such source code cannot contain any preprocessor directives, such
as <code>#include</code>, <code>#define</code>, <code>#if</code>, and so on.

<p>You can force <code>.f</code> files to be preprocessed by <code>cpp</code> by using
<code>-x f77-cpp-input</code>. 
See <a href="#LEX">LEX</a>.

<br><dt><code><var>file</var>.F</code>
<br><dt><code><var>file</var>.fpp</code>
<br><dt><code><var>file</var>.FPP</code>
<dd>Fortran source code that must be preprocessed (by the C preprocessor
<code>cpp</code>, which is part of GNU CC).

<p>Note that preprocessing is not extended to the contents of
files included by the <code>INCLUDE</code> directive--the <code>#include</code>
preprocessor directive must be used instead.

<br><dt><code><var>file</var>.r</code>
<dd>Ratfor source code, which must be preprocessed by the <code>ratfor</code>
command, which is available separately (as it is not yet part of the GNU
Fortran distribution). 
One version in Fortran, adapted for use with <code>g77</code>, is at
<a href="ftp://members.aol.com/n8tm/rat7.uue">ftp://members.aol.com/n8tm/rat7.uue</a> (of uncertain copyright
status).  Another, public domain version in C is at
<a href="http://sepwww.stanford.edu/sep/prof/ratfor.shar.2">http://sepwww.stanford.edu/sep/prof/ratfor.shar.2</a>. 
</dl>

<p>UNIX users typically use the <code><var>file</var>.f</code> and <code><var>file</var>.F</code>
nomenclature. 
Users of other operating systems, especially those that cannot
distinguish upper-case
letters from lower-case letters in their file names, typically use
the <code><var>file</var>.for</code> and <code><var>file</var>.fpp</code> nomenclature.

<p>Use of the preprocessor <code>cpp</code> allows use of C-like
constructs such as <code>#define</code> and <code>#include</code>, but can
lead to unexpected, even mistaken, results due to Fortran's source file
format. 
It is recommended that use of the C preprocessor
be limited to <code>#include</code> and, in
conjunction with <code>#define</code>, only <code>#if</code> and related directives,
thus avoiding in-line macro expansion entirely. 
This recommendation applies especially
when using the traditional fixed source form. 
With free source form,
fewer unexpected transformations are likely to happen, but use of
constructs such as Hollerith and character constants can nevertheless
present problems, especially when these are continued across multiple
source lines. 
These problems result, primarily, from differences between the way
such constants are interpreted by the C preprocessor and by a Fortran
compiler.

<p>Another example of a problem that results from using the C preprocessor
is that a Fortran comment line that happens to contain any
characters "interesting" to the C preprocessor,
such as a backslash at the end of the line,
is not recognized by the preprocessor as a comment line,
so instead of being passed through "raw",
the line is edited according to the rules for the preprocessor. 
For example, the backslash at the end of the line is removed,
along with the subsequent newline, resulting in the next
line being effectively commented out--unfortunate if that
line is a non-comment line of important code!

<p><em>Note:</em> The <code>-traditional</code> and <code>-undef</code> flags are supplied
to <code>cpp</code> by default, to help avoid unpleasant surprises. 
See <a href="gcc.html#Options%20Controlling%20the%20Preprocessor">Preprocessor Options</a>. 
This means that ANSI C preprocessor features (such as the <code>#</code>
operator) aren't available, and only variables in the C reserved
namespace (generally, names with a leading underscore) are liable to
substitution by C predefines. 
Thus, if you want to do system-specific
tests, use, for example, <code>#ifdef __linux__</code> rather than <code>#ifdef linux</code>. 
Use the <code>-v</code> option to see exactly how the preprocessor is invoked.

<p>Unfortunately, the <code>-traditional</code> flag will not avoid an error from
anything that <code>cpp</code> sees as an unterminated C comment, such as:
<pre>C Some Fortran compilers accept /* as starting
C an inline comment.
</pre>
See <a href="#Trailing%20Comment">Trailing Comment</a>.

<p>The following options that affect overall processing are recognized
by the <code>g77</code> and <code>gcc</code> commands in a GNU Fortran installation:

<dl>
<dt><code>-fversion</code>
<dd>Ensure that the <code>g77</code>-specific version of the compiler phase is reported,
if run,
and, starting in <code>egcs</code> version 1.1,
that internal consistency checks in the <code>f771</code> program are run.

<p>This option is supplied automatically when <code>-v</code> or <code>--verbose</code>
is specified as a command-line option for <code>g77</code> or <code>gcc</code>
and when the resulting commands compile Fortran source files.

<br><dt><code>-fset-g77-defaults</code>
<dd><em>Version info:</em>
This option is obsolete in <code>egcs</code>
as of version 1.1. 
The effect is instead achieved
by the <code>lang_init_options</code> routine
in <code>egcs/gcc/f/com.c</code>.

<p>Set up whatever <code>gcc</code> options are to apply to Fortran
compilations, and avoid running internal consistency checks
that might take some time.

<p>This option is supplied automatically when compiling Fortran code
via the <code>g77</code> or <code>gcc</code> command. 
The description of this option is provided so that users seeing
it in the output of, say, <code>g77 -v</code> understand why it is
there.

<p>Also, developers who run <code>f771</code> directly might want to specify it
by hand to get the same defaults as they would running <code>f771</code>
via <code>g77</code> or <code>gcc</code>. 
However, such developers should, after linking a new <code>f771</code>
executable, invoke it without this option once,
e.g. via <kbd>./f771 -quiet &lt; /dev/null</kbd>,
to ensure that they have not introduced any
internal inconsistencies (such as in the table of
intrinsics) before proceeding--<code>g77</code> will crash
with a diagnostic if it detects an inconsistency.

<br><dt><code>-fno-silent</code>
<dd>Print (to <code>stderr</code>) the names of the program units as
they are compiled, in a form similar to that used by popular
UNIX <code>f77</code> implementations and <code>f2c</code>. 
</dl>

<p>See <a href="gcc.html#Options%20Controlling%20the%20Kind%20of%20Output">Overall Options</a>, for information
on more options that control the overall operation of the <code>gcc</code> command
(and, by extension, the <code>g77</code> command).

<h2>Shorthand Options</h2>

<p>The following options serve as "shorthand"
for other options accepted by the compiler:

<dl>
<dt><code>-fugly</code>
<dd><em>Note:</em> This option is no longer supported. 
The information, below, is provided to aid
in the conversion of old scripts.

<p>Specify that certain "ugly" constructs are to be quietly accepted. 
Same as:

<pre>-fugly-args -fugly-assign -fugly-assumed
-fugly-comma -fugly-complex -fugly-init
-fugly-logint
</pre>

<p>These constructs are considered inappropriate to use in new
or well-maintained portable Fortran code, but widely used
in old code. 
See <a href="#Distensions">Distensions</a>, for more information.

<br><dt><code>-fno-ugly</code>
<dd>Specify that all "ugly" constructs are to be noisily rejected. 
Same as:

<pre>-fno-ugly-args -fno-ugly-assign -fno-ugly-assumed
-fno-ugly-comma -fno-ugly-complex -fno-ugly-init
-fno-ugly-logint
</pre>

<p>See <a href="#Distensions">Distensions</a>, for more information.

<br><dt><code>-ff66</code>
<dd>Specify that the program is written in idiomatic FORTRAN 66. 
Same as <code>-fonetrip -fugly-assumed</code>.

<p>The <code>-fno-f66</code> option is the inverse of <code>-ff66</code>. 
As such, it is the same as <code>-fno-onetrip -fno-ugly-assumed</code>.

<p>The meaning of this option is likely to be refined as future
versions of <code>g77</code> provide more compatibility with other
existing and obsolete Fortran implementations.

<br><dt><code>-ff77</code>
<dd>Specify that the program is written in idiomatic UNIX FORTRAN 77
and/or the dialect accepted by the <code>f2c</code> product. 
Same as <code>-fbackslash -fno-typeless-boz</code>.

<p>The meaning of this option is likely to be refined as future
versions of <code>g77</code> provide more compatibility with other
existing and obsolete Fortran implementations.

<br><dt><code>-fno-f77</code>
<dd>The <code>-fno-f77</code> option is <em>not</em> the inverse
of <code>-ff77</code>. 
It specifies that the program is not written in idiomatic UNIX
FORTRAN 77 or <code>f2c</code>, but in a more widely portable dialect. 
<code>-fno-f77</code> is the same as <code>-fno-backslash</code>.

<p>The meaning of this option is likely to be refined as future
versions of <code>g77</code> provide more compatibility with other
existing and obsolete Fortran implementations.

<h2>Options Controlling Fortran Dialect</h2>

<p>The following options control the dialect of Fortran
that the compiler accepts:

<dl>
<dt><code>-ffree-form</code>
<br><dt><code>-fno-fixed-form</code>
<dd>Specify that the source file is written in free form
(introduced in Fortran 90) instead of the more-traditional fixed form.

<br><dt><code>-ff90</code>
<dd>Allow certain Fortran-90 constructs.

<p>This option controls whether certain
Fortran 90 constructs are recognized. 
(Other Fortran 90 constructs
might or might not be recognized depending on other options such as
<code>-fvxt</code>, <code>-ff90-intrinsics-enable</code>, and the
current level of support for Fortran 90.)

<p>See <a href="#Fortran%2090">Fortran 90</a>, for more information.

<br><dt><code>-fvxt</code>
<dd>Specify the treatment of certain constructs that have different
meanings depending on whether the code is written in
GNU Fortran (based on FORTRAN 77 and akin to Fortran 90)
or VXT Fortran (more like VAX FORTRAN).

<p>The default is <code>-fno-vxt</code>. 
<code>-fvxt</code> specifies that the VXT Fortran interpretations
for those constructs are to be chosen.

<p>See <a href="#VXT%20Fortran">VXT Fortran</a>, for more information.

<br><dt><code>-fdollar-ok</code>
<dd>Allow <code>$</code> as a valid character in a symbol name.

<br><dt><code>-fno-backslash</code>
<dd>Specify that <code>\</code> is not to be specially interpreted in character
and Hollerith constants a la C and many UNIX Fortran compilers.

<p>For example, with <code>-fbackslash</code> in effect, <code>A\nB</code> specifies
three characters, with the second one being newline. 
With <code>-fno-backslash</code>, it specifies four characters,
<code>A</code>, <code>\</code>, <code>n</code>, and <code>B</code>.

<p>Note that <code>g77</code> implements a fairly general form of backslash
processing that is incompatible with the narrower forms supported
by some other compilers. 
For example, <code>'A\003B'</code> is a three-character string in <code>g77</code>,
whereas other compilers that support backslash might not support
the three-octal-digit form, and thus treat that string as longer
than three characters.

<p>See <a href="#Backslash%20in%20Constants">Backslash in Constants</a>, for
information on why <code>-fbackslash</code> is the default
instead of <code>-fno-backslash</code>.

<br><dt><code>-fno-ugly-args</code>
<dd>Disallow passing Hollerith and typeless constants as actual
arguments (for example, <code>CALL FOO(4HABCD)</code>).

<p>See <a href="#Ugly%20Implicit%20Argument%20Conversion">Ugly Implicit Argument Conversion</a>, for more information.

<br><dt><code>-fugly-assign</code>
<dd>Use the same storage for a given variable regardless of
whether it is used to hold an assigned-statement label
(as in <code>ASSIGN 10 TO I</code>) or used to hold numeric data
(as in <code>I = 3</code>).

<p>See <a href="#Ugly%20Assigned%20Labels">Ugly Assigned Labels</a>, for more information.

<br><dt><code>-fugly-assumed</code>
<dd>Assume any dummy array with a final dimension specified as <code>1</code>
is really an assumed-size array, as if <code>*</code> had been specified
for the final dimension instead of <code>1</code>.

<p>For example, <code>DIMENSION X(1)</code> is treated as if it
had read <code>DIMENSION X(*)</code>.

<p>See <a href="#Ugly%20Assumed-Size%20Arrays">Ugly Assumed-Size Arrays</a>, for more information.

<br><dt><code>-fugly-comma</code>
<dd>In an external-procedure invocation,
treat a trailing comma in the argument list
as specification of a trailing null argument,
and treat an empty argument list
as specification of a single null argument.

<p>For example, <code>CALL FOO(,)</code> is treated as
<code>CALL FOO(%VAL(0), %VAL(0))</code>. 
That is, <em>two</em> null arguments are specified
by the procedure call when <code>-fugly-comma</code> is in force. 
And <code>F = FUNC()</code> is treated as <code>F = FUNC(%VAL(0))</code>.

<p>The default behavior, <code>-fno-ugly-comma</code>, is to ignore
a single trailing comma in an argument list. 
So, by default, <code>CALL FOO(X,)</code> is treated
exactly the same as <code>CALL FOO(X)</code>.

<p>See <a href="#Ugly%20Null%20Arguments">Ugly Null Arguments</a>, for more information.

<br><dt><code>-fugly-complex</code>
<dd>Do not complain about <code>REAL(<var>expr</var>)</code> or
<code>AIMAG(<var>expr</var>)</code> when <var>expr</var> is a <code>COMPLEX</code>
type other than <code>COMPLEX(KIND=1)</code>--usually
this is used to permit <code>COMPLEX(KIND=2)</code>
(<code>DOUBLE COMPLEX</code>) operands.

<p>The <code>-ff90</code> option controls the interpretation
of this construct.

<p>See <a href="#Ugly%20Complex%20Part%20Extraction">Ugly Complex Part Extraction</a>, for more information.

<br><dt><code>-fno-ugly-init</code>
<dd>Disallow use of Hollerith and typeless constants as initial
values (in <code>PARAMETER</code> and <code>DATA</code> statements), and
use of character constants to
initialize numeric types and vice versa.

<p>For example, <code>DATA I/'F'/, CHRVAR/65/, J/4HABCD/</code> is disallowed by
<code>-fno-ugly-init</code>.

<p>See <a href="#Ugly%20Conversion%20of%20Initializers">Ugly Conversion of Initializers</a>, for more information.

<br><dt><code>-fugly-logint</code>
<dd>Treat <code>INTEGER</code> and <code>LOGICAL</code> variables and
expressions as potential stand-ins for each other.

<p>For example, automatic conversion between <code>INTEGER</code> and
<code>LOGICAL</code> is enabled, for many contexts, via this option.

<p>See <a href="#Ugly%20Integer%20Conversions">Ugly Integer Conversions</a>, for more information.

<br><dt><code>-fonetrip</code>
<dd>Executable iterative <code>DO</code> loops are to be executed at
least once each time they are reached.

<p>ANSI FORTRAN 77 and more recent versions of the Fortran standard
specify that the body of an iterative <code>DO</code> loop is not executed
if the number of iterations calculated from the parameters of the
loop is less than 1. 
(For example, <code>DO 10 I = 1, 0</code>.) 
Such a loop is called a <dfn>zero-trip loop</dfn>.

<p>Prior to ANSI FORTRAN 77, many compilers implemented <code>DO</code> loops
such that the body of a loop would be executed at least once, even
if the iteration count was zero. 
Fortran code written assuming this behavior is said to require
<dfn>one-trip loops</dfn>. 
For example, some code written to the FORTRAN 66 standard
expects this behavior from its <code>DO</code> loops, although that
standard did not specify this behavior.

<p>The <code>-fonetrip</code> option specifies that the source file(s) being
compiled require one-trip loops.

<p>This option affects only those loops specified by the (iterative) <code>DO</code>
statement and by implied-<code>DO</code> lists in I/O statements. 
Loops specified by implied-<code>DO</code> lists in <code>DATA</code> and
specification (non-executable) statements are not affected.

<br><dt><code>-ftypeless-boz</code>
<dd>Specifies that prefix-radix non-decimal constants, such as
<code>Z'ABCD'</code>, are typeless instead of <code>INTEGER(KIND=1)</code>.

<p>You can test for yourself whether a particular compiler treats
the prefix form as <code>INTEGER(KIND=1)</code> or typeless by running the
following program:

<pre>EQUIVALENCE (I, R)
R = Z'ABCD1234'
J = Z'ABCD1234'
IF (J .EQ. I) PRINT *, 'Prefix form is TYPELESS'
IF (J .NE. I) PRINT *, 'Prefix form is INTEGER'
END
</pre>

<p>Reports indicate that many compilers process this form as
<code>INTEGER(KIND=1)</code>, though a few as typeless, and at least one
based on a command-line option specifying some kind of
compatibility.

<br><dt><code>-fintrin-case-initcap</code>
<br><dt><code>-fintrin-case-upper</code>
<br><dt><code>-fintrin-case-lower</code>
<br><dt><code>-fintrin-case-any</code>
<dd>Specify expected case for intrinsic names.

<br><dt><code>-fmatch-case-upper</code>
<br><dt><code>-fmatch-case-lower</code>
<br><dt><code>-fmatch-case-any</code>
<dd>Specify expected case for keywords.

<br><dt><code>-fsource-case-upper</code>
<br><dt><code>-fsource-case-lower</code>
<br><dt><code>-fsource-case-preserve</code>
<dd>Specify whether source text other than character and Hollerith constants
is to be translated to uppercase, to lowercase, or preserved as is. 
<code>-fsource-case-lower</code> is the default.

<br><dt><code>-fsymbol-case-initcap</code>
<br><dt><code>-fsymbol-case-upper</code>
<br><dt><code>-fsymbol-case-lower</code>
<br><dt><code>-fsymbol-case-any</code>

<dd>Same as <code>-fintrin-case-initcap -fmatch-case-initcap -fsource-case-preserve

as in <code>Print *,SqRt(Value)</code>.)

<br><dt><code>-fcase-upper</code>
<dd>Same as <code>-fintrin-case-any -fmatch-case-any -fsource-case-upper
-fsymbol-case-any</code>. 
(Maps all pertinent source to uppercase.)

(Maps all pertinent source to lowercase.)

<br><dt><code>-fcase-preserve</code>
<dd>Same as <code>-fintrin-case-any -fmatch-case-any -fsource-case-preserve
-fsymbol-case-any</code>. 
(Preserves all case in user-defined symbols,
while allowing any-case matching of intrinsics and keywords. 
For example, <code>call Foo(i,I)</code> would pass two <em>different</em>
variables named <code>i</code> and <code>I</code> to a procedure named <code>Foo</code>.)

<h2>Options to Request or Suppress Warnings</h2>

<p>Warnings are diagnostic messages that report constructions which
are not inherently erroneous but which are risky or suggest there
might have been an error.

<p>You can request many specific warnings with options beginning <code>-W</code>,
for example <code>-Wimplicit</code> to request warnings on implicit
declarations.  Each of these specific warning options also has a
negative form beginning <code>-Wno-</code> to turn off warnings;
for example, <code>-Wno-implicit</code>.  This manual lists only one of the
two forms, whichever is not the default.

<p>These options control the amount and kinds of warnings produced by GNU
Fortran:

<dl>
<dt><code>-fsyntax-only</code>
<dd>Check the code for syntax errors, but don't do anything beyond that.

<br><dt><code>-pedantic</code>
<dd>Issue warnings for uses of extensions to ANSI FORTRAN 77. 
<code>-pedantic</code> also applies to C-language constructs where they
occur in GNU Fortran source files, such as use of <code>\e</code> in a
character constant within a directive like <code>#include</code>.

<p>Valid ANSI FORTRAN 77 programs should compile properly with or without
this option. 
However, without this option, certain GNU extensions and traditional
Fortran features are supported as well. 
With this option, many of them are rejected.

<p>Some users try to use <code>-pedantic</code> to check programs for strict ANSI
conformance. 
They soon find that it does not do quite what they want--it finds some
non-ANSI practices, but not all. 
However, improvements to <code>g77</code> in this area are welcome.

<br><dt><code>-pedantic-errors</code>
<dd>Like <code>-pedantic</code>, except that errors are produced rather than
warnings.

<br><dt><code>-fpedantic</code>
<dd>Like <code>-pedantic</code>, but applies only to Fortran constructs.

<br><dt><code>-w</code>
<dd>Inhibit all warning messages.

<br><dt><code>-Wno-globals</code>
<dd>Inhibit warnings about use of a name as both a global name
(a subroutine, function, or block data program unit, or a
common block) and implicitly as the name of an intrinsic
in a source file.

<p>Also inhibit warnings about inconsistent invocations and/or
definitions of global procedures (function and subroutines). 
Such inconsistencies include different numbers of arguments
and different types of arguments.

<br><dt><code>-Wimplicit</code>
<dd>Warn whenever a variable, array, or function is implicitly
declared. 
Has an effect similar to using the <code>IMPLICIT NONE</code> statement
in every program unit. 
(Some Fortran compilers provide this feature by an option
named <code>-u</code> or <code>/WARNINGS=DECLARATIONS</code>.)

<br><dt><code>-Wunused</code>
<dd>Warn whenever a variable is unused aside from its declaration.

<br><dt><code>-Wuninitialized</code>
<dd>Warn whenever an automatic variable is used without first being initialized.

<p>These warnings are possible only in optimizing compilation,
because they require data-flow information that is computed only
when optimizing.  If you don't specify <code>-O</code>, you simply won't
get these warnings.

<p>These warnings occur only for variables that are candidates for
register allocation.  Therefore, they do not occur for a variable
whose address is taken, or whose size
is other than 1, 2, 4 or 8 bytes.  Also, they do not occur for
arrays, even when they are in registers.

<p>Note that there might be no warning about a variable that is used only
to compute a value that itself is never used, because such
computations may be deleted by data-flow analysis before the warnings
are printed.

<p>These warnings are made optional because GNU Fortran is not smart
enough to see all the reasons why the code might be correct
despite appearing to have an error.  Here is one example of how
this can happen:

<pre>SUBROUTINE DISPAT(J)
IF (J.EQ.1) I=1
IF (J.EQ.2) I=4
IF (J.EQ.3) I=5
CALL FOO(I)
END
</pre>

<p>If the value of <code>J</code> is always 1, 2 or 3, then <code>I</code> is
always initialized, but GNU Fortran doesn't know this.  Here is
another common case:

<pre>SUBROUTINE MAYBE(FLAG)
LOGICAL FLAG
IF (FLAG) VALUE = 9.4
<small>...</small>
IF (FLAG) PRINT *, VALUE
END
</pre>

<p>This has no bug because <code>VALUE</code> is used only if it is set.

<br><dt><code>-Wall</code>
<dd>The <code>-Wunused</code> and <code>-Wuninitialized</code> options combined. 
These are all the
options which pertain to usage that we recommend avoiding and that we
believe is easy to avoid. 
(As more warnings are added to <code>g77</code>, some might
be added to the list enabled by <code>-Wall</code>.) 
</dl>

<p>The remaining <code>-W<small>...</small></code> options are not implied by <code>-Wall</code>
because they warn about constructions that we consider reasonable to
use, on occasion, in clean programs.

<dl>
<dt><code>-Wsurprising</code>
<dd>Warn about "suspicious" constructs that are interpreted
by the compiler in a way that might well be surprising to
someone reading the code. 
These differences can result in subtle, compiler-dependent
(even machine-dependent) behavioral differences. 
The constructs warned about include:

<ul>
<li>Expressions having two arithmetic operators in a row, such
as <code>X*-Y</code>. 
Such a construct is nonstandard, and can produce
unexpected results in more complicated situations such
as <code>X**-Y*Z</code>. 
<code>g77</code>, along with many other compilers, interprets
this example differently than many programmers, and a few
other compilers. 
Specifically, <code>g77</code> interprets <code>X**-Y*Z</code> as
<code>(X**(-Y))*Z</code>, while others might think it should
be interpreted as <code>X**(-(Y*Z))</code>.

<p>A revealing example is the constant expression <code>2**-2*1.</code>,
which <code>g77</code> evaluates to .25, while others might evaluate
it to 0., the difference resulting from the way precedence affects
type promotion.

<p>(The <code>-fpedantic</code> option also warns about expressions
having two arithmetic operators in a row.)

</p><li>Expressions with a unary minus followed by an operand and then
a binary operator other than plus or minus. 
For example, <code>-2**2</code> produces a warning, because
the precedence is <code>-(2**2)</code>, yielding -4, not
<code>(-2)**2</code>, which yields 4, and which might represent
what a programmer expects.

<p>An example of an expression producing different results
in a surprising way is <code>-I*S</code>, where <var>I</var> holds
the value <code>-2147483648</code> and <var>S</var> holds <code>0.5</code>. 
On many systems, negating <var>I</var> results in the same
value, not a positive number, because it is already the
lower bound of what an <code>INTEGER(KIND=1)</code> variable can hold. 
So, the expression evaluates to a positive number, while
the "expected" interpretation, <code>(-I)*S</code>, would
evaluate to a negative number.

<p>Even cases such as <code>-I*J</code> produce warnings,
even though, in most configurations and situations,
there is no computational difference between the
results of the two interpretations--the purpose
of this warning is to warn about differing interpretations
and encourage a better style of coding, not to identify
only those places where bugs might exist in the user's
code.

</p><li><code>DO</code> loops with <code>DO</code> variables that are not
of integral type--that is, using <code>REAL</code>
variables as loop control variables. 
Although such loops can be written to work in the
"obvious" way, the way <code>g77</code> is required by the
Fortran standard to interpret such code is likely to
be quite different from the way many programmers expect. 
(This is true of all <code>DO</code> loops, but the differences
are pronounced for non-integral loop control variables.)

<p>See <a href="#Loops">Loops</a>, for more information. 
</ul>

<br><dt><code>-Werror</code>
<dd>Make all warnings into errors.

<br><dt><code>-W</code>
<dd>Turns on "extra warnings" and, if optimization is specified
via <code>-O</code>, the <code>-Wuninitialized</code> option. 
(This might change in future versions of <code>g77</code>.)

<p>"Extra warnings" are issued for:

<ul>
<li>Unused parameters to a procedure (when <code>-Wunused</code> also is
specified).

<li>Overflows involving floating-point constants (not available
for certain configurations). 
</ul>
</dl>

<p>See <a href="gcc.html#Options%20to%20Request%20or%20Suppress%20Warnings">Warning Options</a>, for information on more options offered
by the GBE shared by <code>g77</code>, <code>gcc</code>, and other GNU compilers.

<p>Some of these have no effect when compiling programs written in Fortran:

<dl>
<dt><code>-Wcomment</code>
<br><dt><code>-Wformat</code>
<br><dt><code>-Wparentheses</code>
<br><dt><code>-Wswitch</code>
<br><dt><code>-Wtraditional</code>

<br><dt><code>-Wconversion</code>
<br><dt><code>-Waggregate-return</code>
<br><dt><code>-Wredundant-decls</code>

GNU Fortran programs, but are not yet supported.

<h2>Options for Debugging Your Program or GNU Fortran</h2>

<p>GNU Fortran has various special options that are used for debugging
either your program or <code>g77</code>.

<dl>
<dt><code>-g</code>
<dd>Produce debugging information in the operating system's native format
(stabs, COFF, XCOFF, or DWARF).  GDB can work with this debugging
information.

<p>Support for this option in Fortran programs is incomplete. 
In particular, names of variables and arrays in common blocks
or that are storage-associated via <code>EQUIVALENCE</code> are
unavailable to the debugger.

<p>However, version 0.5.19 of <code>g77</code> does provide this information
in a rudimentary way, as controlled by the
<code>-fdebug-kludge</code> option.

<p>See <a href="#Code%20Gen%20Options">Options for Code Generation Conventions</a>,
for more information. 
</dl>

<p>See <a href="gcc.html#Options%20for%20Debugging%20Your%20Program%20or%20GNU%20CC">Debugging Options</a>, for more information on debugging options.

<h2>Options That Control Optimization</h2>

<p>Most Fortran users will want to use no optimization when
developing and testing programs, and use <code>-O</code> or <code>-O2</code> when
compiling programs for late-cycle testing and for production use. 
However, note that certain diagnostics--such as for uninitialized
variables--depend on the flow analysis done by <code>-O</code>, i.e. you
must use <code>-O</code> or <code>-O2</code> to get such diagnostics.

<p>The following flags have particular applicability when
compiling Fortran programs:

<dl>
<dt><code>-malign-double</code>
<dd>(Intel x86 architecture only.)

<p>Noticeably improves performance of <code>g77</code> programs making
heavy use of <code>REAL(KIND=2)</code> (<code>DOUBLE PRECISION</code>) data
on some systems. 
In particular, systems using Pentium, Pentium Pro, 586, and
686 implementations
of the i386 architecture execute programs faster when
<code>REAL(KIND=2)</code> (<code>DOUBLE PRECISION</code>) data are
aligned on 64-bit boundaries
in memory.

<p>This option can, at least, make benchmark results more consistent
across various system configurations, versions of the program,
and data sets.

<p><em>Note:</em> The warning in the <code>gcc</code> documentation about
this option does not apply, generally speaking, to Fortran
code compiled by <code>g77</code>.

<p>See <a href="#Aligned%20Data">Aligned Data</a>, for more information on alignment issues.

<p><em>Also also note:</em> The negative form of <code>-malign-double</code>
is <code>-mno-align-double</code>, not <code>-benign-double</code>.

<br><dt><code>-ffloat-store</code>
<dd>Might help a Fortran program that depends on exact IEEE conformance on
some machines, but might slow down a program that doesn't.

<p>This option is effective when the floating-point unit is set to work in
IEEE 854 `extended precision'--as it typically is on x86 and m68k GNU
systems--rather than IEEE 754 double precision.  <code>-ffloat-store</code>
tries to remove the extra precision by spilling data from floating-point
registers into memory and this typically involves a big performance
hit.  However, it doesn't affect intermediate results, so that it is
only partially effective.  `Excess precision' is avoided in code like:
<pre>a = b + c
d = a * e
</pre>
but not in code like:
<pre>      d = (b + c) * e
</pre>

<p>For another, potentially better, way of controlling the precision,
see <a href="#Floating-point%20precision">Floating-point precision</a>.

<br><dt><code>-fforce-mem</code>
<br><dt><code>-fforce-addr</code>
<dd>Might improve optimization of loops.

<br><dt><code>-fno-inline</code>
<dd>Don't compile statement functions inline. 
Might reduce the size of a program unit--which might be at
expense of some speed (though it should compile faster). 
Note that if you are not optimizing, no functions can be expanded inline.

<br><dt><code>-ffast-math</code>
<dd>Might allow some programs designed to not be too dependent
on IEEE behavior for floating-point to run faster, or die trying.

<br><dt><code>-fstrength-reduce</code>
<dd>Might make some loops run faster.

<br><dt><code>-frerun-cse-after-loop</code>
<br><dt><code>-fexpensive-optimizations</code>
<br><dt><code>-fdelayed-branch</code>
<br><dt><code>-fschedule-insns</code>
<br><dt><code>-fschedule-insns2</code>
<br><dt><code>-fcaller-saves</code>
<dd>Might improve performance on some code.

<br><dt><code>-funroll-loops</code>
<dd>Typically improves performance on code using iterative <code>DO</code> loops by
unrolling them and is probably generally appropriate for Fortran, though
it is not turned on at any optimization level. 
Note that outer loop unrolling isn't done specifically; decisions about
whether to unroll a loop are made on the basis of its instruction count.

<p>Also, no `loop discovery'<a rel=footnote href="#fn-1"><sup>1</sup></a> is done, so only loops written with <code>DO</code>
benefit from loop optimizations, including--but not limited
to--unrolling.  Loops written with <code>IF</code> and <code>GOTO</code> are not
currently recognized as such.  This option unrolls only iterative
<code>DO</code> loops, not <code>DO WHILE</code> loops.

<br><dt><code>-funroll-all-loops</code>
<dd>Probably improves performance on code using <code>DO WHILE</code> loops by
unrolling them in addition to iterative <code>DO</code> loops.  In the absence
of <code>DO WHILE</code>, this option is equivalent to <code>-funroll-loops</code>
but possibly slower.

<br><dt><code>-fno-move-all-movables</code>
<br><dt><code>-fno-reduce-all-givs</code>
<br><dt><code>-fno-rerun-loop-opt</code>
<dd><em>Version info:</em>
These options are not supported by
versions of <code>g77</code> based on <code>gcc</code> version 2.8.

<p>Each of these might improve performance on some code.

<p>Analysis of Fortran code optimization and the resulting
optimizations triggered by the above options were
contributed by Toon Moene (<a href="mailto:toon@moene.indiv.nluug.nl">toon@moene.indiv.nluug.nl</a>).

<p>These three options are intended to be removed someday, once
they have helped determine the efficacy of various
approaches to improving the performance of Fortran code.

<p>Please let us know how use of these options affects
the performance of your production code. 
We're particularly interested in code that runs faster
when these options are <em>disabled</em>, and in
non-Fortran code that benefits when they are
<em>enabled</em> via the above <code>gcc</code> command-line options.

<h2>Options Controlling the Preprocessor</h2>

<p>These options control the C preprocessor, which is run on each C source
file before actual compilation.

<p>See <a href="gcc.html#Options%20Controlling%20the%20Preprocessor">Preprocessor Options</a>, for information on C preprocessor options.

<p>Some of these options also affect how <code>g77</code> processes the
<code>INCLUDE</code> directive. 
Since this directive is processed even when preprocessing
is not requested, it is not described in this section. 
See <a href="#Directory%20Options">Options for Directory Search</a>, for
information on how <code>g77</code> processes the <code>INCLUDE</code> directive.

<p>However, the <code>INCLUDE</code> directive does not apply
preprocessing to the contents of the included file itself.

<p>Therefore, any file that contains preprocessor directives
(such as <code>#include</code>, <code>#define</code>, and <code>#if</code>)
must be included via the <code>#include</code> directive, not
via the <code>INCLUDE</code> directive. 
Therefore, any file containing preprocessor directives,
if included, is necessarily included by a file that itself
contains preprocessor directives.

<h2>Options for Directory Search</h2>

<p>These options affect how the <code>cpp</code> preprocessor searches
for files specified via the <code>#include</code> directive. 
Therefore, when compiling Fortran programs, they are meaningful
when the preprocessor is used.

<p>Some of these options also affect how <code>g77</code> searches
for files specified via the <code>INCLUDE</code> directive,
although files included by that directive are not,
themselves, preprocessed. 
These options are:

<dl>
<dt><code>-I-</code>
<br><dt><code>-I<var>dir</var></code>
<dd>These affect interpretation of the <code>INCLUDE</code> directive
(as well as of the <code>#include</code> directive of the <code>cpp</code>
preprocessor).

<p>Note that <code>-I<var>dir</var></code> must be specified <em>without</em> any
spaces between <code>-I</code> and the directory name--that is,
<code>-Ifoo/bar</code> is valid, but <code>-I foo/bar</code>
is rejected by the <code>g77</code> compiler (though the preprocessor supports
the latter form). 
Also note that the general behavior of <code>-I</code> and
<code>INCLUDE</code> is pretty much the same as of <code>-I</code> with
<code>#include</code> in the <code>cpp</code> preprocessor, with regard to
looking for <code>header.gcc</code> files and other such things.

<p>See <a href="gcc.html#Options%20for%20Directory%20Search">Directory Options</a>, for information on the <code>-I</code> option.

<h2>Options for Code Generation Conventions</h2>

<p>These machine-independent options control the interface conventions
used in code generation.

<p>Most of them have both positive and negative forms; the negative form
of <code>-ffoo</code> would be <code>-fno-foo</code>.  In the table below, only
one of the forms is listed--the one which is not the default.  You
can figure out the other form by either removing <code>no-</code> or adding
it.

<dl>
<dt><code>-fno-automatic</code>
<dd>Treat each program unit as if the <code>SAVE</code> statement was specified
for every local variable and array referenced in it. 
Does not affect common blocks. 
(Some Fortran compilers provide this option under
the name <code>-static</code>.)

<br><dt><code>-finit-local-zero</code>
<dd>Specify that variables and arrays that are local to a program unit
(not in a common block and not passed as an argument) are to be initialized
to binary zeros.

<p>Since there is a run-time penalty for initialization of variables
that are not given the <code>SAVE</code> attribute, it might be a
good idea to also use <code>-fno-automatic</code> with <code>-finit-local-zero</code>.

<br><dt><code>-fno-f2c</code>
<dd>Do not generate code designed to be compatible with code generated
by <code>f2c</code>; use the GNU calling conventions instead.

<p>The <code>f2c</code> calling conventions require functions that return
type <code>REAL(KIND=1)</code> to actually return the C type <code>double</code>,
and functions that return type <code>COMPLEX</code> to return the
values via an extra argument in the calling sequence that points
to where to store the return value. 
Under the GNU calling conventions, such functions simply return
their results as they would in GNU C--<code>REAL(KIND=1)</code> functions
return the C type <code>float</code>, and <code>COMPLEX</code> functions
return the GNU C type <code>complex</code> (or its <code>struct</code>
equivalent).

<p>This does not affect the generation of code that interfaces with the
<code>libg2c</code> library.

<p>However, because the <code>libg2c</code> library uses <code>f2c</code>
calling conventions, <code>g77</code> rejects attempts to pass
intrinsics implemented by routines in this library as actual
arguments when <code>-fno-f2c</code> is used, to avoid bugs when
they are actually called by code expecting the GNU calling
conventions to work.

<p>For example, <code>INTRINSIC ABS;CALL FOO(ABS)</code> is
rejected when <code>-fno-f2c</code> is in force. 
(Future versions of the <code>g77</code> run-time library might
offer routines that provide GNU-callable versions of the
routines that implement the <code>f2c</code>-callable intrinsics
that may be passed as actual arguments, so that
valid programs need not be rejected when <code>-fno-f2c</code>
is used.)

<p><strong>Caution:</strong> If <code>-fno-f2c</code> is used when compiling any
source file used in a program, it must be used when compiling
<em>all</em> Fortran source files used in that program.

<br><dt><code>-ff2c-library</code>
<dd>Specify that use of <code>libg2c</code> (or the original <code>libf2c</code>)
is required. 
This is the default for the current version of <code>g77</code>.

<p>Currently it is not
valid to specify <code>-fno-f2c-library</code>. 
This option is provided so users can specify it in shell
scripts that build programs and libraries that require the
<code>libf2c</code> library, even when being compiled by future
versions of <code>g77</code> that might otherwise default to
generating code for an incompatible library.

<br><dt><code>-fno-underscoring</code>
<dd>Do not transform names of entities specified in the Fortran
source file by appending underscores to them.

<p>With <code>-funderscoring</code> in effect, <code>g77</code> appends two underscores
to names with underscores and one underscore to external names with
no underscores.  (<code>g77</code> also appends two underscores to internal
names with underscores to avoid naming collisions with external names. 
The <code>-fno-second-underscore</code> option disables appending of the
second underscore in all cases.)

<p>This is done to ensure compatibility with code produced by many
UNIX Fortran compilers, including <code>f2c</code>, which perform the
same transformations.

<p>Use of <code>-fno-underscoring</code> is not recommended unless you are
experimenting with issues such as integration of (GNU) Fortran into
existing system environments (vis-a-vis existing libraries, tools, and
so on).

<p>For example, with <code>-funderscoring</code>, and assuming other defaults like
<code>-fcase-lower</code> and that <code>j()</code> and <code>max_count()</code> are
external functions while <code>my_var</code> and <code>lvar</code> are local variables,
a statement like

<pre>I = J() + MAX_COUNT (MY_VAR, LVAR)
</pre>

<p>is implemented as something akin to:

<pre>i = j_() + max_count__(&amp;my_var__, &amp;lvar);
</pre>

<p>With <code>-fno-underscoring</code>, the same statement is implemented as:

<pre>i = j() + max_count(&amp;my_var, &amp;lvar);
</pre>

<p>Use of <code>-fno-underscoring</code> allows direct specification of
user-defined names while debugging and when interfacing <code>g77</code>-compiled
code with other languages.

<p>Note that just because the names match does <em>not</em> mean that the
interface implemented by <code>g77</code> for an external name matches the
interface implemented by some other language for that same name. 
That is, getting code produced by <code>g77</code> to link to code produced
by some other compiler using this or any other method can be only a
small part of the overall solution--getting the code generated by
both compilers to agree on issues other than naming can require
significant effort, and, unlike naming disagreements, linkers normally
cannot detect disagreements in these other areas.

<p>Also, note that with <code>-fno-underscoring</code>, the lack of appended
underscores introduces the very real possibility that a user-defined
external name will conflict with a name in a system library, which
could make finding unresolved-reference bugs quite difficult in some
cases--they might occur at program run time, and show up only as
buggy behavior at run time.

<p>In future versions of <code>g77</code>, we hope to improve naming and linking
issues so that debugging always involves using the names as they appear
in the source, even if the names as seen by the linker are mangled to
prevent accidental linking between procedures with incompatible
interfaces.

<br><dt><code>-fno-second-underscore</code>
<dd>Do not append a second underscore to names of entities specified
in the Fortran source file.

<p>This option has no effect if <code>-fno-underscoring</code> is
in effect.

<p>Otherwise, with this option, an external name such as <code>MAX_COUNT</code>
is implemented as a reference to the link-time external symbol
<code>max_count_</code>, instead of <code>max_count__</code>.

<br><dt><code>-fno-ident</code>
<dd>Ignore the <code>#ident</code> directive.

<br><dt><code>-fzeros</code>
<dd>Treat initial values of zero as if they were any other value.

<p>As of version 0.5.18, <code>g77</code> normally treats <code>DATA</code> and
other statements that are used to specify initial values of zero
for variables and arrays as if no values were actually specified,
in the sense that no diagnostics regarding multiple initializations
are produced.

<p>This is done to speed up compiling of programs that initialize
large arrays to zeros.

<p>Use <code>-fzeros</code> to revert to the simpler, slower behavior
that can catch multiple initializations by keeping track of
all initializations, zero or otherwise.

<p><em>Caution:</em> Future versions of <code>g77</code> might disregard this option
(and its negative form, the default) or interpret it somewhat
differently. 
The interpretation changes will affect only non-standard
programs; standard-conforming programs should not be affected.

<br><dt><code>-fdebug-kludge</code>
<dd>Emit information on <code>COMMON</code> and <code>EQUIVALENCE</code> members
that might help users of debuggers work around lack of proper debugging
information on such members.

<p>As of version 0.5.19, <code>g77</code> offers this option to emit
information on members of aggregate areas to help users while debugging. 
This information consists of establishing the type and contents of each
such member so that, when a debugger is asked to print the contents,
the printed information provides rudimentary debugging information. 
This information identifies the name of the aggregate area (either the
<code>COMMON</code> block name, or the <code>g77</code>-assigned name for the
<code>EQUIVALENCE</code> name) and the offset, in bytes, of the member from
the beginning of the area.

<p>Using <code>gdb</code>, this information is not coherently displayed in the Fortran
language mode, so temporarily switching to the C language mode to display the
information is suggested. 
Use <code>set language c</code> and <code>set language fortran</code> to accomplish this.

<p>For example:

<pre>      COMMON /X/A,B
      EQUIVALENCE (C,D)
      CHARACTER XX*50
      EQUIVALENCE (I,XX(20:20))
      END

<p>Use <code>-fdebug-kludge</code> to generate this information,
which might make some programs noticeably larger.

<p><em>Caution:</em> Future versions of <code>g77</code> might disregard this option
(and its negative form). 
Current plans call for this to happen when published versions of <code>g77</code>
and <code>gdb</code> exist that provide proper access to debugging information on
<code>COMMON</code> and <code>EQUIVALENCE</code> members.

<br><dt><code>-femulate-complex</code>
<dd>Implement <code>COMPLEX</code> arithmetic via emulation,
instead of using the facilities of
the <code>gcc</code> back end that provide direct support of
<code>complex</code> arithmetic.

<p>(<code>gcc</code> had some bugs in its back-end support
for <code>complex</code> arithmetic, due primarily to the support not being
completed as of version 2.8.1 and <code>egcs</code> 1.1.2.)

<p>Use <code>-femulate-complex</code> if you suspect code-generation bugs,
or experience compiler crashes,
that might result from <code>g77</code> using the <code>COMPLEX</code> support
in the <code>gcc</code> back end. 
If using that option fixes the bugs or crashes you are seeing,
that indicates a likely <code>g77</code> bugs
(though, all compiler crashes are considered bugs),
so, please report it. 
(Note that the known bugs, now believed fixed, produced compiler crashes
rather than causing the generation of incorrect code.)

<p>Use of this option should not affect how Fortran code compiled
by <code>g77</code> works in terms of its interfaces to other code,
e.g. that compiled by <code>f2c</code>.

<p><em>Caution:</em> Future versions of <code>g77</code> might ignore both forms
of this option.

<br><dt><code>-falias-check</code>
<br><dt><code>-fargument-alias</code>
<br><dt><code>-fargument-noalias</code>
<br><dt><code>-fno-argument-noalias-global</code>
<dd><em>Version info:</em>
These options are not supported by
versions of <code>g77</code> based on <code>gcc</code> version 2.8.

<p>These options specify to what degree aliasing
(overlap)
is permitted between
arguments (passed as pointers) and <code>COMMON</code> (external, or
public) storage.

<p>The default for Fortran code, as mandated by the FORTRAN 77 and
Fortran 90 standards, is <code>-fargument-noalias-global</code>. 
The default for code written in the C language family is
<code>-fargument-alias</code>.

<p>Note that, on some systems, compiling with <code>-fforce-addr</code> in
effect can produce more optimal code when the default aliasing
options are in effect (and when optimization is enabled).

<p>See <a href="#Aliasing%20Assumed%20To%20Work">Aliasing Assumed To Work</a>, for detailed information on the implications
of compiling Fortran code that depends on the ability to alias dummy
arguments.

<br><dt><code>-fno-globals</code>
<dd>Disable diagnostics about inter-procedural
analysis problems, such as disagreements about the
type of a function or a procedure's argument,
that might cause a compiler crash when attempting
to inline a reference to a procedure within a
program unit. 
(The diagnostics themselves are still produced, but
as warnings, unless <code>-Wno-globals</code> is specified,
in which case no relevant diagnostics are produced.)

<p>Further, this option disables such inlining, to
avoid compiler crashes resulting from incorrect
code that would otherwise be diagnosed.

<p>As such, this option might be quite useful when
compiling existing, "working" code that happens
to have a few bugs that do not generally show themselves,
but which <code>g77</code> diagnoses.

<p>Use of this option therefore has the effect of
instructing <code>g77</code> to behave more like it did
up through version 0.5.19.1, when it paid little or
no attention to disagreements between program units
about a procedure's type and argument information,
and when it performed no inlining of procedures
(except statement functions).

<p>Without this option, <code>g77</code> defaults to performing
the potentially inlining procedures as it started doing
in version 0.5.20, but as of version 0.5.21, it also
diagnoses disagreements that might cause such inlining
to crash the compiler as (fatal) errors,
and warns about similar disagreements
that are currently believed to not
likely to result in the compiler later crashing
or producing incorrect code.

<br><dt><code>-fflatten-arrays</code>
<dd>Use back end's C-like constructs
(pointer plus offset)
instead of its <code>ARRAY_REF</code> construct
to handle all array references.

<p><em>Note:</em> This option is not supported. 
It is intended for use only by <code>g77</code> developers,
to evaluate code-generation issues. 
It might be removed at any time.

<br><dt><code>-fbounds-check</code>
<dt><code>-ffortran-bounds-check</code>
<dd>Enable generation of run-time checks for array subscripts
and substring start and end points
against the (locally) declared minimum and maximum values.

<p>The current implementation uses the <code>libf2c</code>
library routine <code>s_rnge</code> to print the diagnostic.

<p>However, whereas <code>f2c</code> generates a single check per
reference for a multi-dimensional array, of the computed
offset against the valid offset range (0 through the size of the array),
<code>g77</code> generates a single check per <em>subscript</em> expression. 
This catches some cases of potential bugs that <code>f2c</code> does not,
such as references to below the beginning of an assumed-size array.

<p><code>g77</code> also generates checks for <code>CHARACTER</code> substring references,
something <code>f2c</code> currently does not do.

<p>Use the new <code>-ffortran-bounds-check</code> option
to specify bounds-checking for only the Fortran code you are compiling,
not necessarily for code written in other languages.

<p><em>Note:</em> To provide more detailed information on the offending subscript,
<code>g77</code> provides the <code>libg2c</code> run-time library routine <code>s_rnge</code>
with somewhat differently-formatted information. 
Here's a sample diagnostic:

<pre>Subscript out of range on file line 4, procedure rnge.f/bf.
Attempt to access the -6-th element of variable b[subscript-2-of-2].
Aborted
</pre>

<p>The above message indicates that the offending source line is
line 4 of the file <code>rnge.f</code>,
within the program unit (or statement function) named <code>bf</code>. 
The offended array is named <code>b</code>. 
The offended array dimension is the second for a two-dimensional array,
and the offending, computed subscript expression was <code>-6</code>.

<p>For a <code>CHARACTER</code> substring reference, the second line has
this appearance:

<pre>Attempt to access the 11-th element of variable a[start-substring].
</pre>

<p>This indicates that the offended <code>CHARACTER</code> variable or array
is named <code>a</code>,
the offended substring position is the starting (leftmost) position,
and the offending substring expression is <code>11</code>.

<p>(Though the verbage of <code>s_rnge</code> is not ideal
for the purpose of the <code>g77</code> compiler,
the above information should provide adequate diagnostic abilities
to it users.) 
</dl>

<p>See <a href="gcc.html#Options%20for%20Code%20Generation%20Conventions">Code Gen Options</a>, for information on more options
offered by the GBE
shared by <code>g77</code>, <code>gcc</code>, and other GNU compilers.

<p>Some of these do <em>not</em> work when compiling programs written in Fortran:

<dl>
<dt><code>-fpcc-struct-return</code>
<br><dt><code>-freg-struct-return</code>
<dd>You should not use these except strictly the same way as you
used them to build the version of <code>libg2c</code> with which
you will be linking all code compiled by <code>g77</code> with the
same option.

<br><dt><code>-fshort-double</code>
<dd>This probably either has no effect on Fortran programs, or
makes them act loopy.

<br><dt><code>-fno-common</code>
<dd>Do not use this when compiling Fortran programs,
or there will be Trouble.

<br><dt><code>-fpack-struct</code>
<dd>This probably will break any calls to the <code>libg2c</code> library,
at the very least, even if it is built with the same option.

<h1>News About GNU Fortran</h1>

<p>Changes made to recent versions of GNU Fortran are listed
below, with the most recent version first.

<p>The changes are generally listed in order:

<ol type=1 start=1>
</p><li>Code-generation and run-time-library bug-fixes

<li>Compiler and run-time-library crashes involving valid code
that have been fixed

<li>New features

<li>Fixes and enhancements to existing features

<li>New diagnostics

<li>Internal improvements

<li>Miscellany
</ol>

<p>This order is not strict--for example, some items
involve a combination of these elements.

<p>Note that two variants of <code>g77</code> are tracked below. 
The <code>egcs</code> variant is described vis-a-vis
previous versions of <code>egcs</code> and/or
an official FSF version,
as appropriate.

<p>Therefore, <code>egcs</code> versions sometimes have multiple listings
to help clarify how they differ from other versions,
though this can make getting a complete picture
of what a particular <code>egcs</code> version contains
somewhat more difficult.

<p>For information on bugs in the GCC-2.95 version of <code>g77</code>,
see <a href="#Known%20Bugs">Known Bugs In GNU Fortran</a>.

<p>An online, "live" version of this document
(derived directly from the mainline, development version
of <code>g77</code> within <code>egcs</code>)
is available at
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/onlinedocs/g77_news.html">http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/onlinedocs/g77_news.html</a>.

<p>The following information was last updated on 1999-07-08:

<h2>In 0.5.25, <code>GCC</code> 2.95 (<code>EGCS</code> 1.2) versus <code>EGCS</code> 1.1.2:</h2>

<ul>
<li><code>g77</code> no longer generates bad code for assignments,
or other conversions,
of <code>REAL</code> or <code>COMPLEX</code> constant expressions
to type <code>INTEGER(KIND=2)</code>
(often referred to as <code>INTEGER*8</code>).

<p>For example, <code>INTEGER*8 J; J = 4E10</code> now works as documented.

</p><li><code>g77</code> no longer truncates <code>INTEGER(KIND=2)</code>
(usually <code>INTEGER*8</code>)
subscript expressions when evaluating array references
on systems with pointers widers than <code>INTEGER(KIND=1)</code>
(such as Alphas).

<li><code>g77</code> no longer generates bad code
for an assignment to a <code>COMPLEX</code> variable or array
that partially overlaps one or more of the sources
of the same assignment
(a very rare construction). 
It now assigns through a temporary,
in cases where such partial overlap is deemed possible.

<li><code>libg2c</code> (<code>libf2c</code>) no longer loses track
of the file being worked on
during a <code>BACKSPACE</code> operation.

<li><code>libg2c</code> (<code>libf2c</code>) fixes a bug whereby
input to a <code>NAMELIST</code> read involving a repeat count,
such as <code>K(5)=10*3</code>,
was not properly handled by <code>libf2c</code>. 
The first item was written to <code>K(5)</code>,
but the remaining nine were written elsewhere (still within the array),
not necessarily starting at <code>K(6)</code>.

<li>Automatic arrays now seem to be working on HP-UX systems.

<li>The <code>Date</code> intrinsic now returns the correct result
on big-endian systems.

<li>Fix <code>g77</code> so it no longer crashes when compiling
I/O statements using keywords that define <code>INTEGER</code> values,
such as <code>IOSTAT=<var>j</var></code>,
where <var>j</var> is other than default <code>INTEGER</code>
(such as <code>INTEGER*2</code>). 
Instead, it issues a diagnostic.

<li>Fix <code>g77</code> so it properly handles <code>DATA A/<var>rpt</var>*<var>val</var>/</code>,
where <var>rpt</var> is not default <code>INTEGER</code>, such as <code>INTEGER*2</code>,
instead of producing a spurious diagnostic. 
Also fix <code>DATA (A(I),I=1,N)</code>,
where <code>N</code> is not default <code>INTEGER</code>
to work instead of crashing <code>g77</code>.

<li>The <code>-ax</code> option is now obeyed when compiling Fortran programs. 
(It is passed to the <code>f771</code> driver.)

<li>The new <code>-fbounds-check</code> option
causes <code>g77</code> to compile run-time bounds checks
of array subscripts, as well as of substring start and end points.

<li><code>libg2c</code> now supports building as multilibbed library,
which provides better support for systems
that require options such as <code>-mieee</code>
to work properly.

<li>Source file names with the suffixes <code>.FOR</code> and <code>.FPP</code>
now are recognized by <code>g77</code>
as if they ended in <code>.for</code> and <code>.fpp</code>, respectively.

<li>The order of arguments to the <em>subroutine</em> forms of the
<code>CTime</code>, <code>DTime</code>, <code>ETime</code>, and <code>TtyNam</code>
intrinsics has been swapped. 
The argument serving as the returned value
for the corresponding function forms
now is the <em>second</em> argument,
making these consistent with the other subroutine forms
of <code>libU77</code> intrinsics.

<li><code>g77</code> now warns about a reference to an intrinsic
that has an interface that is not Year 2000 (Y2K) compliant. 
Also, <code>libg2c</code> has been changed to increase the likelihood
of catching references to the implementations of these intrinsics
using the <code>EXTERNAL</code> mechanism
(which would avoid the new warnings).

<p>See <a href="#Year%202000%20(Y2K)%20Problems">Year 2000 (Y2K) Problems</a>, for more information.

</p><li><code>g77</code> now warns about a reference to a function
when the corresponding <em>subsequent</em> function program unit
disagrees with the reference concerning the type of the function.

<li><code>-fno-emulate-complex</code> is now the default option. 
This should result in improved performance
of code that uses the <code>COMPLEX</code> data type.

<li>The <code>-malign-double</code> option
now reliably aligns <em>all</em> double-precision variables and arrays
on Intel x86 targets.

<li>Even without the <code>-malign-double</code> option,
<code>g77</code> reliably aligns local double-precision variables
that are not in <code>EQUIVALENCE</code> areas
and not <code>SAVE</code>'d.

<li><code>g77</code> now open-codes ("inlines") division of <code>COMPLEX</code> operands
instead of generating a run-time call to
the <code>libf2c</code> routines <code>c_div</code> or <code>z_div</code>,
unless the <code>-Os</code> option is specified.

<li><code>g77</code> no longer generates code to maintain <code>errno</code>,
a C-language concept,
when performing operations such as the <code>SqRt</code> intrinsic.

<li><code>g77</code> developers can temporarily use
the <code>-fflatten-arrays</code> option
to compare how the compiler handles code generation
using C-like constructs as compared to the
Fortran-like method constructs normally used.

<li>A substantial portion of the <code>g77</code> front end's code-generation component
was rewritten. 
It now generates code using facilities more robustly supported
by the <code>gcc</code> back end. 
One effect of this rewrite is that some codes no longer produce
a spurious "label <var>lab</var> used before containing binding contour"
message.

<li>Support for the <code>-fugly</code> option has been removed.

<li>Improve documentation and indexing,
including information on Year 2000 (Y2K) compliance,
and providing more information on internals of the front end.

<li>Upgrade to <code>libf2c</code> as of 1999-05-10. 
</ul>

<h2>In 0.5.24 versus 0.5.23:</h2>

<p>There is no <code>g77</code> version 0.5.24 at this time,
or planned. 
0.5.24 is the version number designated for bug fixes and,
perhaps, some new features added,
to 0.5.23. 
Version 0.5.23 requires <code>gcc</code> 2.8.1,
as 0.5.24 was planned to require.

<p>Due to <code>EGCS</code> becoming <code>GCC</code>
(which is now an acronym for "GNU Compiler Collection"),
and <code>EGCS</code> 1.2 becoming officially designated <code>GCC</code> 2.95,
there seems to be no need for an actual 0.5.24 release.

<p>To reduce the confusion already resulting from use of 0.5.24
to designate <code>g77</code> versions within <code>EGCS</code> versions 1.0 and 1.1,
as well as in versions of <code>g77</code> documentation and notices
during that period,
"mainline" <code>g77</code> version numbering resumes
at 0.5.25 with <code>GCC</code> 2.95 (<code>EGCS</code> 1.2),
skipping over 0.5.24 as a placeholder version number.

<p>To repeat, there is no <code>g77</code> 0.5.24, but there is now a 0.5.25. 
Please remain calm and return to your keypunch units.

<h2>In <code>EGCS</code> 1.1.2 versus <code>EGCS</code> 1.1.1:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Fix the <code>IDate</code> intrinsic (VXT) (in <code>libg2c</code>)
so the returned year is in the documented, non-Y2K-compliant range
of 0-99,
instead of being returned as 100 in the year 2000.

<p>See <a href="#IDate%20Intrinsic%20(VXT)">IDate Intrinsic (VXT)</a>,
for more information.

</p><li>Fix the <code>Date_and_Time</code> intrinsic (in <code>libg2c</code>)
to return the milliseconds value properly
in <var>Values</var>(8).

<li>Fix the <code>LStat</code> intrinsic (in <code>libg2c</code>)
to return device-ID information properly
in <var>SArray</var>(7).

<li>Improve documentation. 
</ul>

<h2>In <code>EGCS</code> 1.1.1 versus <code>EGCS</code> 1.1:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Fix <code>libg2c</code> so it performs an implicit <code>ENDFILE</code> operation
(as appropriate)
whenever a <code>REWIND</code> is done.

<p>(This bug was introduced in 0.5.23 and <code>egcs</code> 1.1 in
<code>g77</code>'s version of <code>libf2c</code>.)

</p><li>Fix <code>libg2c</code> so it no longer crashes with a spurious diagnostic
upon doing any I/O following a direct formatted write.

<p>(This bug was introduced in 0.5.23 and <code>egcs</code> 1.1 in
<code>g77</code>'s version of <code>libf2c</code>.)

</p><li>Fix <code>g77</code> so it no longer crashes compiling references
to the <code>Rand</code> intrinsic on some systems.

<li>Fix <code>g77</code> portion of installation process so it works
better on some systems
(those with shells requiring <code>else true</code> clauses
on <code>if</code> constructs
for the completion code to be set properly). 
</ul>

<h2>In <code>EGCS</code> 1.1 versus <code>EGCS</code> 1.0.3:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Fix bugs in the <code>libU77</code> intrinsic <code>HostNm</code>
that wrote one byte beyond the end of its <code>CHARACTER</code>
argument,
and in the <code>libU77</code> intrinsics
<code>GMTime</code> and <code>LTime</code>
that overwrote their arguments.

<li>Assumed arrays with negative bounds
(such as <code>REAL A(-1:*)</code>)
no longer elicit spurious diagnostics from <code>g77</code>,
even on systems with pointers having
different sizes than integers.

<p>This bug is not known to have existed in any
recent version of <code>gcc</code>. 
It was introduced in an early release of <code>egcs</code>.

</p><li>Valid combinations of <code>EXTERNAL</code>,
passing that external as a dummy argument
without explicitly giving it a type,
and, in a subsequent program unit,
referencing that external as
an external function with a different type
no longer crash <code>g77</code>.

<li><code>CASE DEFAULT</code> no longer crashes <code>g77</code>.

<li>The <code>-Wunused</code> option no longer issues a spurious
warning about the "master" procedure generated by
<code>g77</code> for procedures containing <code>ENTRY</code> statements.

<li>Support <code>FORMAT(I&lt;<var>expr</var>&gt;)</code> when <var>expr</var> is a
compile-time constant <code>INTEGER</code> expression.

<li>Fix <code>g77</code> <code>-g</code> option so procedures that
use <code>ENTRY</code> can be stepped through, line by line,
in <code>gdb</code>.

<li>Allow any <code>REAL</code> argument to intrinsics
<code>Second</code> and <code>CPU_Time</code>.

<li>Use <code>tempnam</code>, if available, to open scratch files
(as in <code>OPEN(STATUS='SCRATCH')</code>)
so that the <code>TMPDIR</code> environment variable,
if present, is used.

<li><code>g77</code>'s version of <code>libf2c</code> separates out
the setting of global state
(such as command-line arguments and signal handling)
from <code>main.o</code> into distinct, new library
archive members.

<p>This should make it easier to write portable applications
that have their own (non-Fortran) <code>main()</code> routine
properly set up the <code>libf2c</code> environment, even
when <code>libf2c</code> (now <code>libg2c</code>) is a shared library.

</p><li><code>g77</code> no longer installs the <code>f77</code> command
and <code>f77.1</code> man page
in the <code>/usr</code> or <code>/usr/local</code> heirarchy,
even if the <code>f77-install-ok</code> file exists
in the source or build directory. 
See the installation documentation for more information.

<li><code>g77</code> no longer installs the <code>libf2c.a</code> library
and <code>f2c.h</code> include file
in the <code>/usr</code> or <code>/usr/local</code> heirarchy,
even if the <code>f2c-install-ok</code> or <code>f2c-exists-ok</code> files exist
in the source or build directory. 
See the installation documentation for more information.

<li>The <code>libf2c.a</code> library produced by <code>g77</code> has been
renamed to <code>libg2c.a</code>. 
It is installed only in the <code>gcc</code> "private"
directory heirarchy, <code>gcc-lib</code>. 
This allows system administrators and users to choose which
version of the <code>libf2c</code> library from <code>netlib</code> they
wish to use on a case-by-case basis. 
See the installation documentation for more information.

<li>The <code>f2c.h</code> include (header) file produced by <code>g77</code>
has been renamed to <code>g2c.h</code>. 
It is installed only in the <code>gcc</code> "private"
directory heirarchy, <code>gcc-lib</code>. 
This allows system administrators and users to choose which
version of the include file from <code>netlib</code> they
wish to use on a case-by-case basis. 
See the installation documentation for more information.

<li>The <code>g77</code> command now expects the run-time library
to be named <code>libg2c.a</code> instead of <code>libf2c.a</code>,
to ensure that a version other than the one built and
installed as part of the same <code>g77</code> version is picked up.

<li>During the configuration and build process,
<code>g77</code> creates subdirectories it needs only as it
needs them. 
Other cleaning up of the configuration and build process
has been performed as well.

<li><code>install-info</code> now used to update the directory of
Info documentation to contain an entry for <code>g77</code>
(during installation).

<li>Some diagnostics have been changed from warnings to errors,
to prevent inadvertent use of the resulting, probably buggy,
programs. 
These mostly include diagnostics about use of unsupported features
in the <code>OPEN</code>, <code>INQUIRE</code>, <code>READ</code>, and
<code>WRITE</code> statements,
and about truncations of various sorts of constants.

<li>Improve compilation of <code>FORMAT</code> expressions so that
a null byte is appended to the last operand if it
is a constant. 
This provides a cleaner run-time diagnostic as provided
by <code>libf2c</code> for statements like <code>PRINT '(I1', 42</code>.

<li>Improve documentation and indexing.

<li>The upgrade to <code>libf2c</code> as of 1998-06-18
should fix a variety of problems, including
those involving some uses of the <code>T</code> format
specifier, and perhaps some build (porting) problems
as well. 
</ul>

<h2>In <code>EGCS</code> 1.1 versus <code>g77</code> 0.5.23:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Fix a code-generation bug that afflicted
Intel x86 targets when <code>-O2</code> was specified
compiling, for example, an old version of
the <code>DNRM2</code> routine.

<p>The x87 coprocessor stack was being
mismanaged in cases involving assigned <code>GOTO</code>
and <code>ASSIGN</code>.

</p><li><code>g77</code> no longer produces incorrect code
and initial values
for <code>EQUIVALENCE</code> and <code>COMMON</code>
aggregates that, due to "unnatural" ordering of members
vis-a-vis their types, require initial padding.

<li>Fix <code>g77</code> crash compiling code
containing the construct <code>CMPLX(0.)</code> or similar.

<li><code>g77</code> no longer crashes when compiling code
containing specification statements such as
<code>INTEGER(KIND=7) PTR</code>.

<li><code>g77</code> no longer crashes when compiling code
such as <code>J = SIGNAL(1, 2)</code>.

<li><code>g77</code> now treats <code>%LOC(<var>expr</var>)</code> and
<code>LOC(<var>expr</var>)</code> as "ordinary" expressions
when they are used as arguments in procedure calls. 
This change applies only to global (filewide) analysis,
making it consistent with
how <code>g77</code> actually generates code
for these cases.

<p>Previously, <code>g77</code> treated these expressions
as denoting special "pointer" arguments
for the purposes of filewide analysis.

</p><li>Fix <code>g77</code> crash
(or apparently infinite run-time)
when compiling certain complicated expressions
involving <code>COMPLEX</code> arithmetic
(especially multiplication).

<li>Align static double-precision variables and arrays
on Intel x86 targets
regardless of whether <code>-malign-double</code> is specified.

<p>Generally, this affects only local variables and arrays
having the <code>SAVE</code> attribute
or given initial values via <code>DATA</code>.

</p><li>The <code>g77</code> driver now ensures that <code>-lg2c</code>
is specified in the link phase prior to any
occurrence of <code>-lm</code>. 
This prevents accidentally linking to a routine
in the SunOS4 <code>-lm</code> library
when the generated code wants to link to the one
in <code>libf2c</code> (<code>libg2c</code>).

<li><code>g77</code> emits more debugging information when
<code>-g</code> is used.

<p>This new information allows, for example,
<kbd>which __g77_length_a</kbd> to be used in <code>gdb</code>
to determine the type of the phantom length argument
supplied with <code>CHARACTER</code> variables.

<p>This information pertains to internally-generated
type, variable, and other information,
not to the longstanding deficiencies vis-a-vis
<code>COMMON</code> and <code>EQUIVALENCE</code>.

</p><li>The F90 <code>Date_and_Time</code> intrinsic now is
supported.

<li>The F90 <code>System_Clock</code> intrinsic allows
the optional arguments (except for the <code>Count</code>
argument) to be omitted.

<li>Upgrade to <code>libf2c</code> as of 1998-06-18.

<li>Improve documentation and indexing. 
</ul>

<h2>In 0.5.23 versus 0.5.22:</h2>

<ul>
<li>This release contains several regressions against
version 0.5.22 of <code>g77</code>, due to using the
"vanilla" <code>gcc</code> back end instead of patching
it to fix a few bugs and improve performance in a
few cases.

<p>Features that have been dropped from this version
of <code>g77</code> due to their being implemented
via <code>g77</code>-specific patches to the <code>gcc</code>
back end in previous releases include:

<ul>
<li>Support for <code>__restrict__</code> keyword,
the options <code>-fargument-alias</code>, <code>-fargument-noalias</code>,
and <code>-fargument-noalias-global</code>,
and the corresponding alias-analysis code.

<p>(<code>egcs</code> has the alias-analysis
code, but not the <code>__restrict__</code> keyword. 
<code>egcs</code> <code>g77</code> users benefit from the alias-analysis
code despite the lack of the <code>__restrict__</code> keyword,
which is a C-language construct.)

</p><li>Support for the GNU compiler options
<code>-fmove-all-movables</code>,
<code>-freduce-all-givs</code>,
and <code>-frerun-loop-opt</code>.

<p>(<code>egcs</code> supports these options. 
<code>g77</code> users of <code>egcs</code> benefit from them even if
they are not explicitly specified,
because the defaults are optimized for <code>g77</code> users.)

</p><li>Support for the <code>-W</code> option warning about
integer division by zero.

<li>The Intel x86-specific option <code>-malign-double</code>
applying to stack-allocated data
as well as statically-allocate data. 
</ul>

<p>Note that the <code>gcc/f/gbe/</code> subdirectory has been removed
from this distribution as a result of <code>g77</code> no longer
including patches for the <code>gcc</code> back end.

</p><li>Fix bugs in the <code>libU77</code> intrinsic <code>HostNm</code>
that wrote one byte beyond the end of its <code>CHARACTER</code>
argument,
and in the <code>libU77</code> intrinsics
<code>GMTime</code> and <code>LTime</code>
that overwrote their arguments.

<li>Support <code>gcc</code> version 2.8,
and remove support for prior versions of <code>gcc</code>.

<li>Remove support for the <code>--driver</code> option,
as <code>g77</code> now does all the driving,
just like <code>gcc</code>.

<li><code>CASE DEFAULT</code> no longer crashes <code>g77</code>.

<li>Valid combinations of <code>EXTERNAL</code>,
passing that external as a dummy argument
without explicitly giving it a type,
and, in a subsequent program unit,
referencing that external as
an external function with a different type
no longer crash <code>g77</code>.

<li><code>g77</code> no longer installs the <code>f77</code> command
and <code>f77.1</code> man page
in the <code>/usr</code> or <code>/usr/local</code> heirarchy,
even if the <code>f77-install-ok</code> file exists
in the source or build directory. 
See the installation documentation for more information.

<li><code>g77</code> no longer installs the <code>libf2c.a</code> library
and <code>f2c.h</code> include file
in the <code>/usr</code> or <code>/usr/local</code> heirarchy,
even if the <code>f2c-install-ok</code> or <code>f2c-exists-ok</code> files exist
in the source or build directory. 
See the installation documentation for more information.

<li>The <code>libf2c.a</code> library produced by <code>g77</code> has been
renamed to <code>libg2c.a</code>. 
It is installed only in the <code>gcc</code> "private"
directory heirarchy, <code>gcc-lib</code>. 
This allows system administrators and users to choose which
version of the <code>libf2c</code> library from <code>netlib</code> they
wish to use on a case-by-case basis. 
See the installation documentation for more information.

<li>The <code>f2c.h</code> include (header) file produced by <code>g77</code>
has been renamed to <code>g2c.h</code>. 
It is installed only in the <code>gcc</code> "private"
directory heirarchy, <code>gcc-lib</code>. 
This allows system administrators and users to choose which
version of the include file from <code>netlib</code> they
wish to use on a case-by-case basis. 
See the installation documentation for more information.

<li>The <code>g77</code> command now expects the run-time library
to be named <code>libg2c.a</code> instead of <code>libf2c.a</code>,
to ensure that a version other than the one built and
installed as part of the same <code>g77</code> version is picked up.

<li>The <code>-Wunused</code> option no longer issues a spurious
warning about the "master" procedure generated by
<code>g77</code> for procedures containing <code>ENTRY</code> statements.

<li><code>g77</code>'s version of <code>libf2c</code> separates out
the setting of global state
(such as command-line arguments and signal handling)
from <code>main.o</code> into distinct, new library
archive members.

<p>This should make it easier to write portable applications
that have their own (non-Fortran) <code>main()</code> routine
properly set up the <code>libf2c</code> environment, even
when <code>libf2c</code> (now <code>libg2c</code>) is a shared library.

</p><li>During the configuration and build process,
<code>g77</code> creates subdirectories it needs only as it
needs them, thus avoiding unnecessary creation of, for example,
<code>stage1/f/runtime</code> when doing a non-bootstrap build. 
Other cleaning up of the configuration and build process
has been performed as well.

<li><code>install-info</code> now used to update the directory of
Info documentation to contain an entry for <code>g77</code>
(during installation).

<li>Some diagnostics have been changed from warnings to errors,
to prevent inadvertent use of the resulting, probably buggy,
programs. 
These mostly include diagnostics about use of unsupported features
in the <code>OPEN</code>, <code>INQUIRE</code>, <code>READ</code>, and
<code>WRITE</code> statements,
and about truncations of various sorts of constants.

<li>Improve documentation and indexing.

<li>Upgrade to <code>libf2c</code> as of 1998-04-20.

<p>This should fix a variety of problems, including
those involving some uses of the <code>T</code> format
specifier, and perhaps some build (porting) problems
as well. 
</ul>

<h2>In 0.5.22 versus 0.5.21:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Fix code generation for iterative <code>DO</code> loops that
have one or more references to the iteration variable,
or to aliases of it, in their control expressions. 
For example, <code>DO 10 J=2,J</code> now is compiled correctly.

<li>Fix a code-generation bug that afflicted
Intel x86 targets when <code>-O2</code> was specified
compiling, for example, an old version of
the <code>DNRM2</code> routine.

<p>The x87 coprocessor stack was being
mismanaged in cases involving assigned <code>GOTO</code>
and <code>ASSIGN</code>.

</p><li>Fix <code>DTime</code> intrinsic so as not to truncate
results to integer values (on some systems).

<li>Fix <code>Signal</code> intrinsic so it offers portable
support for 64-bit systems (such as Digital Alphas
running GNU/Linux).

<li>Fix run-time crash involving <code>NAMELIST</code> on 64-bit
machines such as Alphas.

<li>Fix <code>g77</code> version of <code>libf2c</code> so it no longer
produces a spurious <code>I/O recursion</code> diagnostic at run time
when an I/O operation (such as <code>READ *,I</code>) is interrupted
in a manner that causes the program to be terminated
via the <code>f_exit</code> routine (such as via <kbd>C-c</kbd>).

<li>Fix <code>g77</code> crash triggered by <code>CASE</code> statement with
an omitted lower or upper bound.

<li>Fix <code>g77</code> crash compiling references to <code>CPU_Time</code>
intrinsic.

<li>Fix <code>g77</code> crash
(or apparently infinite run-time)
when compiling certain complicated expressions
involving <code>COMPLEX</code> arithmetic
(especially multiplication).

<li>Fix <code>g77</code> crash on statements such as
<code>PRINT *, (REAL(Z(I)),I=1,2)</code>, where
<code>Z</code> is <code>DOUBLE COMPLEX</code>.

<li>Fix a <code>g++</code> crash.

<li>Support <code>FORMAT(I&lt;<var>expr</var>&gt;)</code> when <var>expr</var> is a
compile-time constant <code>INTEGER</code> expression.

<li>Fix <code>g77</code> <code>-g</code> option so procedures that
use <code>ENTRY</code> can be stepped through, line by line,
in <code>gdb</code>.

<li>Fix a profiling-related bug in <code>gcc</code> back end for
Intel x86 architecture.

<li>Allow any <code>REAL</code> argument to intrinsics
<code>Second</code> and <code>CPU_Time</code>.

<li>Allow any numeric argument to intrinsics
<code>Int2</code> and <code>Int8</code>.

<li>Use <code>tempnam</code>, if available, to open scratch files
(as in <code>OPEN(STATUS='SCRATCH')</code>)
so that the <code>TMPDIR</code> environment variable,
if present, is used.

<li>Rename the <code>gcc</code> keyword <code>restrict</code> to
<code>__restrict__</code>, to avoid rejecting valid, existing,
C programs. 
Support for <code>restrict</code> is now more like support
for <code>complex</code>.

<li>Fix <code>-fpedantic</code> to not reject procedure invocations
such as <code>I=J()</code> and <code>CALL FOO()</code>.

<li>Fix <code>-fugly-comma</code> to affect invocations of
only external procedures. 
Restore rejection of gratuitous trailing omitted
arguments to intrinsics, as in <code>I=MAX(3,4,,)</code>.

<li>Fix compiler so it accepts <code>-fgnu-intrinsics-*</code> and
<code>-fbadu77-intrinsics-*</code> options.

<li>Improve diagnostic messages from <code>libf2c</code>
so it is more likely that the printing of the
active format string is limited to the string,
with no trailing garbage being printed.

<p>(Unlike <code>f2c</code>, <code>g77</code> did not append
a null byte to its compiled form of every
format string specified via a <code>FORMAT</code> statement. 
However, <code>f2c</code> would exhibit the problem
anyway for a statement like <code>PRINT '(I)garbage', 1</code>
by printing <code>(I)garbage</code> as the format string.)

</p><li>Improve compilation of <code>FORMAT</code> expressions so that
a null byte is appended to the last operand if it
is a constant. 
This provides a cleaner run-time diagnostic as provided
by <code>libf2c</code> for statements like <code>PRINT '(I1', 42</code>.

<li>Fix various crashes involving code with diagnosed errors.

<li>Fix cross-compilation bug when configuring <code>libf2c</code>.

<li>Improve diagnostics.

<li>Improve documentation and indexing.

<li>Upgrade to <code>libf2c</code> as of 1997-09-23. 
This fixes a formatted-I/O bug that afflicted
64-bit systems with 32-bit integers
(such as Digital Alpha running GNU/Linux). 
</ul>

<h2>In <code>EGCS</code> 1.0.2 versus <code>EGCS</code> 1.0.1:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Fix <code>g77</code> crash triggered by <code>CASE</code> statement with
an omitted lower or upper bound.

<li>Fix <code>g77</code> crash on statements such as
<code>PRINT *, (REAL(Z(I)),I=1,2)</code>, where
<code>Z</code> is <code>DOUBLE COMPLEX</code>.

<li>Fix <code>-fPIC</code> (such as compiling for ELF targets)
on the Intel x86 architecture target
so invalid assembler code is no longer produced.

<li>Fix <code>-fpedantic</code> to not reject procedure invocations
such as <code>I=J()</code> and <code>CALL FOO()</code>.

<li>Fix <code>-fugly-comma</code> to affect invocations of
only external procedures. 
Restore rejection of gratuitous trailing omitted
arguments to intrinsics, as in <code>I=MAX(3,4,,)</code>.

<li>Fix compiler so it accepts <code>-fgnu-intrinsics-*</code> and
<code>-fbadu77-intrinsics-*</code> options. 
</ul>

<h2>In <code>EGCS</code> 1.0.1 versus <code>EGCS</code> 1.0:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Fix run-time crash involving <code>NAMELIST</code> on 64-bit
machines such as Alphas. 
</ul>

<h2>In <code>EGCS</code> 1.0 versus <code>g77</code> 0.5.21:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Version 1.0 of <code>egcs</code>
contains several regressions against
version 0.5.21 of <code>g77</code>,
due to using the
"vanilla" <code>gcc</code> back end instead of patching
it to fix a few bugs and improve performance in a
few cases.

<p>Features that have been dropped from this version
of <code>g77</code> due to their being implemented
via <code>g77</code>-specific patches to the <code>gcc</code>
back end in previous releases include:

<ul>
<li>Support for the C-language <code>restrict</code> keyword.

<li>Support for the <code>-W</code> option warning about
integer division by zero.

<li>The Intel x86-specific option <code>-malign-double</code>
applying to stack-allocated data
as well as statically-allocate data. 
</ul>

<p>Note that the <code>gcc/f/gbe/</code> subdirectory has been removed
from this distribution as a result of <code>g77</code>
being fully integrated with
the <code>egcs</code> variant of the <code>gcc</code> back end.

</p><li>Fix code generation for iterative <code>DO</code> loops that
have one or more references to the iteration variable,
or to aliases of it, in their control expressions. 
For example, <code>DO 10 J=2,J</code> now is compiled correctly.

<li>Fix <code>DTime</code> intrinsic so as not to truncate
results to integer values (on some systems).

<li>Some Fortran code, miscompiled
by <code>g77</code> built on <code>gcc</code> version 2.8.1
on m68k-next-nextstep3 configurations
when using the <code>-O2</code> option,
is now compiled correctly. 
It is believed that a C function known to miscompile
on that configuration
when using the <code>-O2 -funroll-loops</code> options
also is now compiled correctly.

<li>Remove support for non-<code>egcs</code> versions of <code>gcc</code>.

<li>Remove support for the <code>--driver</code> option,
as <code>g77</code> now does all the driving,
just like <code>gcc</code>.

<li>Allow any numeric argument to intrinsics
<code>Int2</code> and <code>Int8</code>.

<li>Improve diagnostic messages from <code>libf2c</code>
so it is more likely that the printing of the
active format string is limited to the string,
with no trailing garbage being printed.

<p>(Unlike <code>f2c</code>, <code>g77</code> did not append
a null byte to its compiled form of every
format string specified via a <code>FORMAT</code> statement. 
However, <code>f2c</code> would exhibit the problem
anyway for a statement like <code>PRINT '(I)garbage', 1</code>
by printing <code>(I)garbage</code> as the format string.)

</p><li>Upgrade to <code>libf2c</code> as of 1997-09-23. 
This fixes a formatted-I/O bug that afflicted
64-bit systems with 32-bit integers
(such as Digital Alpha running GNU/Linux). 
</ul>

<h2>In 0.5.21:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Fix a code-generation bug introduced by 0.5.20
caused by loop unrolling (by specifying
<code>-funroll-loops</code> or similar). 
This bug afflicted all code compiled by
version 2.7.2.2.f.2 of <code>gcc</code> (C, C++,
Fortran, and so on).

<li>Fix a code-generation bug manifested when
combining local <code>EQUIVALENCE</code> with a
<code>DATA</code> statement that follows
the first executable statement (or is
treated as an executable-context statement
as a result of using the <code>-fpedantic</code>
option).

<li>Fix a compiler crash that occured when an
integer division by a constant zero is detected. 
Instead, when the <code>-W</code> option is specified,
the <code>gcc</code> back end issues a warning about such a case. 
This bug afflicted all code compiled by
version 2.7.2.2.f.2 of <code>gcc</code> (C, C++,
Fortran, and so on).

<li>Fix a compiler crash that occurred in some cases
of procedure inlining. 
(Such cases became more frequent in 0.5.20.)

<li>Fix a compiler crash resulting from using <code>DATA</code>
or similar to initialize a <code>COMPLEX</code> variable or
array to zero.

<li>Fix compiler crashes involving use of <code>AND</code>, <code>OR</code>,
or <code>XOR</code> intrinsics.

<li>Fix compiler bug triggered when using a <code>COMMON</code>
or <code>EQUIVALENCE</code> variable
as the target of an <code>ASSIGN</code>
or assigned-<code>GOTO</code> statement.

<li>Fix compiler crashes due to using the name of a some
non-standard intrinsics (such as <code>FTell</code> or
<code>FPutC</code>) as such and as the name of a procedure
or common block. 
Such dual use of a name in a program is allowed by
the standard.

<li>Place automatic arrays on the stack, even if
<code>SAVE</code> or the <code>-fno-automatic</code> option
is in effect. 
This avoids a compiler crash in some cases.

<li>The <code>-malign-double</code> option now reliably aligns
<code>DOUBLE PRECISION</code> optimally on Pentium and
Pentium Pro architectures (586 and 686 in <code>gcc</code>).

<li>New option <code>-Wno-globals</code> disables warnings
about "suspicious" use of a name both as a global
name and as the implicit name of an intrinsic, and
warnings about disagreements over the number or natures of
arguments passed to global procedures, or the
natures of the procedures themselves.

<p>The default is to issue such warnings, which are
new as of this version of <code>g77</code>.

</p><li>New option <code>-fno-globals</code> disables diagnostics
about potentially fatal disagreements
analysis problems, such as disagreements over the
number or natures of arguments passed to global
procedures, or the natures of those procedures themselves.

<p>The default is to issue such diagnostics and flag
the compilation as unsuccessful. 
With this option, the diagnostics are issued as
warnings, or, if <code>-Wno-globals</code> is specified,
are not issued at all.

<p>This option also disables inlining of global procedures,
to avoid compiler crashes resulting from coding errors
that these diagnostics normally would identify.

</p><li>Diagnose cases where a reference to a procedure
disagrees with the type of that procedure, or
where disagreements about the number or nature
of arguments exist. 
This avoids a compiler crash.

<li>Fix parsing bug whereby <code>g77</code> rejected a
second initialization specification immediately
following the first's closing <code>/</code> without
an intervening comma in a <code>DATA</code> statement,
and the second specification was an implied-DO list.

<li>Improve performance of the <code>gcc</code> back end so
certain complicated expressions involving <code>COMPLEX</code>
arithmetic (especially multiplication) don't appear to
take forever to compile.

<li>Fix a couple of profiling-related bugs in <code>gcc</code>
back end.

<li>Integrate GNU Ada's (GNAT's) changes to the back end,
which consist almost entirely of bug fixes. 
These fixes are circa version 3.10p of GNAT.

<li>Include some other <code>gcc</code> fixes that seem useful in
<code>g77</code>'s version of <code>gcc</code>. 
(See <code>gcc/ChangeLog</code> for details--compare it
to that file in the vanilla <code>gcc-2.7.2.3.tar.gz</code>
distribution.)

<li>Fix <code>libU77</code> routines that accept file and other names
to strip trailing blanks from them, for consistency
with other implementations. 
Blanks may be forcibly appended to such names by
appending a single null character (<code>CHAR(0)</code>)
to the significant trailing blanks.

<li>Fix <code>CHMOD</code> intrinsic to work with file names
that have embedded blanks, commas, and so on.

<li>Fix <code>SIGNAL</code> intrinsic so it accepts an
optional third <code>Status</code> argument.

<li>Fix <code>IDATE()</code> intrinsic subroutine (VXT form)
so it accepts arguments in the correct order. 
Documentation fixed accordingly, and for
<code>GMTIME()</code> and <code>LTIME()</code> as well.

<li>Make many changes to <code>libU77</code> intrinsics to
support existing code more directly.

<p>Such changes include allowing both subroutine and
function forms of many routines, changing <code>MCLOCK()</code>
and <code>TIME()</code> to return <code>INTEGER(KIND=1)</code> values,
introducing <code>MCLOCK8()</code> and <code>TIME8()</code> to
return <code>INTEGER(KIND=2)</code> values,
and placing functions that are intended to perform
side effects in a new intrinsic group, <code>badu77</code>.

</p><li>Improve <code>libU77</code> so it is more portable.

<li>Add options <code>-fbadu77-intrinsics-delete</code>,
<code>-fbadu77-intrinsics-hide</code>, and so on.

<li>Fix crashes involving diagnosed or invalid code.

<li><code>g77</code> and <code>gcc</code> now do a somewhat better
job detecting and diagnosing arrays that are too
large to handle before these cause diagnostics
during the assembler or linker phase, a compiler
crash, or generation of incorrect code.

<li>Make some fixes to alias analysis code.

<li>Add support for <code>restrict</code> keyword in <code>gcc</code>
front end.

<li>Support <code>gcc</code> version 2.7.2.3
(modified by <code>g77</code> into version 2.7.2.3.f.1),
and remove
support for prior versions of <code>gcc</code>.

<li>Incorporate GNAT's patches to the <code>gcc</code> back
end into <code>g77</code>'s, so GNAT users do not need
to apply GNAT's patches to build both GNAT and <code>g77</code>
from the same source tree.

<li>Modify <code>make</code> rules and related code so that
generation of Info documentation doesn't require
compilation using <code>gcc</code>. 
Now, any ANSI C compiler should be adequate to
produce the <code>g77</code> documentation (in particular,
the tables of intrinsics) from scratch.

<li>Add <code>INT2</code> and <code>INT8</code> intrinsics.

<li>Add <code>CPU_TIME</code> intrinsic.

<li>Add <code>ALARM</code> intrinsic.

<li><code>CTIME</code> intrinsic now accepts any <code>INTEGER</code>
argument, not just <code>INTEGER(KIND=2)</code>.

<li>Warn when explicit type declaration disagrees with
the type of an intrinsic invocation.

<li>Support <code>*f771</code> entry in <code>gcc</code> <code>specs</code> file.

<li>Fix typo in <code>make</code> rule <code>g77-cross</code>, used only for
cross-compiling.

<li>Fix <code>libf2c</code> build procedure to re-archive library
if previous attempt to archive was interrupted.

<li>Change <code>gcc</code> to unroll loops only during the last
invocation (of as many as two invocations) of loop
optimization.

<li>Improve handling of <code>-fno-f2c</code> so that code that
attempts to pass an intrinsic as an actual argument,
such as <code>CALL FOO(ABS)</code>, is rejected due to the fact
that the run-time-library routine is, effectively,
compiled with <code>-ff2c</code> in effect.

<li>Fix <code>g77</code> driver to recognize <code>-fsyntax-only</code>
as an option that inhibits linking, just like <code>-c</code> or
<code>-S</code>, and to recognize and properly handle the
<code>-nostdlib</code>, <code>-M</code>, <code>-MM</code>, <code>-nodefaultlibs</code>,
and <code>-Xlinker</code> options.

<li>Upgrade to <code>libf2c</code> as of 1997-08-16.

<li>Modify <code>libf2c</code> to consistently and clearly diagnose
recursive I/O (at run time).

<li><code>g77</code> driver now prints version information (such as produced
by <kbd>g77 -v</kbd>) to <code>stderr</code> instead of <code>stdout</code>.

<li>The <code>.r</code> suffix now designates a Ratfor source file,
to be preprocessed via the <code>ratfor</code> command, available
separately.

<li>Fix some aspects of how <code>gcc</code> determines what kind of
system is being configured and what kinds are supported. 
For example, GNU Linux/Alpha ELF systems now are directly
supported.

<li>Improve diagnostics.

<li>Improve documentation and indexing.

<li>Include all pertinent files for <code>libf2c</code> that come
from <code>netlib.bell-labs.com</code>; give any such files
that aren't quite accurate in <code>g77</code>'s version of
<code>libf2c</code> the suffix <code>.netlib</code>.

<li>Reserve <code>INTEGER(KIND=0)</code> for future use. 
</ul>

<h2>In 0.5.20:</h2>

<ul>
<li>The <code>-fno-typeless-boz</code> option is now the default.

<p>This option specifies that non-decimal-radix
constants using the prefixed-radix form (such as <code>Z'1234'</code>)
are to be interpreted as <code>INTEGER(KIND=1)</code> constants. 
Specify <code>-ftypeless-boz</code> to cause such
constants to be interpreted as typeless.

<p>(Version 0.5.19 introduced <code>-fno-typeless-boz</code> and
its inverse.)

<p>See <a href="#Fortran%20Dialect%20Options">Options Controlling Fortran Dialect</a>,
for information on the <code>-ftypeless-boz</code> option.

</p><li>Options <code>-ff90-intrinsics-enable</code> and
<code>-fvxt-intrinsics-enable</code> now are the
defaults.

<p>Some programs might use names that clash with
intrinsic names defined (and now enabled) by these
options or by the new <code>libU77</code> intrinsics. 
Users of such programs might need to compile them
differently (using, for example, <code>-ff90-intrinsics-disable</code>)
or, better yet, insert appropriate <code>EXTERNAL</code>
statements specifying that these names are not intended
to be names of intrinsics.

</p><li>The <code>ALWAYS_FLUSH</code> macro is no longer defined when
building <code>libf2c</code>, which should result in improved
I/O performance, especially over NFS.

<p><em>Note:</em> If you have code that depends on the behavior
of <code>libf2c</code> when built with <code>ALWAYS_FLUSH</code> defined,
you will have to modify <code>libf2c</code> accordingly before
building it from this and future versions of <code>g77</code>.

<p>See <a href="#Output%20Assumed%20To%20Flush">Output Assumed To Flush</a>, for more information.

</p><li>Dave Love's implementation of <code>libU77</code> has been
added to the version of <code>libf2c</code> distributed with
and built as part of <code>g77</code>. 
<code>g77</code> now knows about the routines in this library
as intrinsics.

<li>New option <code>-fvxt</code> specifies that the
source file is written in VXT Fortran, instead of GNU Fortran.

<p>See <a href="#VXT%20Fortran">VXT Fortran</a>, for more information on the constructs
recognized when the <code>-fvxt</code> option is specified.

</p><li>The <code>-fvxt-not-f90</code> option has been deleted,
along with its inverse, <code>-ff90-not-vxt</code>.

<p>If you used one of these deleted options, you should
re-read the pertinent documentation to determine which
options, if any, are appropriate for compiling your
code with this version of <code>g77</code>.

<p>See <a href="#Other%20Dialects">Other Dialects</a>, for more information.

</p><li>The <code>-fugly</code> option now issues a warning, as it
likely will be removed in a future version.

<p>(Enabling all the <code>-fugly-*</code> options is unlikely
to be feasible, or sensible, in the future,
so users should learn to specify only those
<code>-fugly-*</code> options they really need for a
particular source file.)

</p><li>The <code>-fugly-assumed</code> option, introduced in
version 0.5.19, has been changed to
better accommodate old and new code.

<p>See <a href="#Ugly%20Assumed-Size%20Arrays">Ugly Assumed-Size Arrays</a>, for more information.

</p><li>Make a number of fixes to the <code>g77</code> front end and
the <code>gcc</code> back end to better support Alpha (AXP)
machines. 
This includes providing at least one bug-fix to the
<code>gcc</code> back end for Alphas.

<li>Related to supporting Alpha (AXP) machines, the <code>LOC()</code>
intrinsic and <code>%LOC()</code> construct now return
values of <code>INTEGER(KIND=0)</code> type,
as defined by the GNU Fortran language.

<p>This type is wide enough
(holds the same number of bits)
as the character-pointer type on the machine.

<p>On most machines, this won't make a difference,
whereas, on Alphas and other systems with 64-bit pointers,
the <code>INTEGER(KIND=0)</code> type is equivalent to <code>INTEGER(KIND=2)</code>
(often referred to as <code>INTEGER*8</code>)
instead of the more common <code>INTEGER(KIND=1)</code>
(often referred to as <code>INTEGER*4</code>).

</p><li>Emulate <code>COMPLEX</code> arithmetic in the <code>g77</code> front
end, to avoid bugs in <code>complex</code> support in the
<code>gcc</code> back end. 
New option <code>-fno-emulate-complex</code>
causes <code>g77</code> to revert the 0.5.19 behavior.

<li>Fix bug whereby <code>REAL A(1)</code>, for example, caused
a compiler crash if <code>-fugly-assumed</code> was in effect
and <var>A</var> was a local (automatic) array. 
That case is no longer affected by the new
handling of <code>-fugly-assumed</code>.

<li>Fix <code>g77</code> command driver so that <code>g77 -o foo.f</code>
no longer deletes <code>foo.f</code> before issuing other
diagnostics, and so the <code>-x</code> option is properly
handled.

<li>Enable inlining of subroutines and functions by the <code>gcc</code>
back end. 
This works as it does for <code>gcc</code> itself--program units
may be inlined for invocations that follow them in the same
program unit, as long as the appropriate compile-time
options are specified.

<li>Dummy arguments are no longer assumed to potentially alias
(overlap)
other dummy arguments or <code>COMMON</code> areas when any of
these are defined (assigned to) by Fortran code.

<p>This can result in faster and/or smaller programs when
compiling with optimization enabled, though on some
systems this effect is observed only when <code>-fforce-addr</code>
also is specified.

<p>New options <code>-falias-check</code>, <code>-fargument-alias</code>,
<code>-fargument-noalias</code>,
and <code>-fno-argument-noalias-global</code> control the
way <code>g77</code> handles potential aliasing.

<p>See <a href="#Aliasing%20Assumed%20To%20Work">Aliasing Assumed To Work</a>, for detailed information on why the
new defaults might result in some programs no longer working the way they
did when compiled by previous versions of <code>g77</code>.

</p><li>The <code>CONJG()</code> and <code>DCONJG()</code> intrinsics now
are compiled in-line.

<li>The bug-fix for 0.5.19.1 has been re-done. 
The <code>g77</code> compiler has been changed back to
assume <code>libf2c</code> has no aliasing problems in
its implementations of the <code>COMPLEX</code> (and
<code>DOUBLE COMPLEX</code>) intrinsics. 
The <code>libf2c</code> has been changed to have no such
problems.

<p>As a result, 0.5.20 is expected to offer improved performance
over 0.5.19.1, perhaps as good as 0.5.19 in most
or all cases, due to this change alone.

<p><em>Note:</em> This change requires version 0.5.20 of
<code>libf2c</code>, at least, when linking code produced
by any versions of <code>g77</code> other than 0.5.19.1. 
Use <code>g77 -v</code> to determine the version numbers
of the <code>libF77</code>, <code>libI77</code>, and <code>libU77</code>
components of the <code>libf2c</code> library. 
(If these version numbers are not printed--in
particular, if the linker complains about unresolved
references to names like <code>g77__fvers__</code>--that
strongly suggests your installation has an obsolete
version of <code>libf2c</code>.)

</p><li>New option <code>-fugly-assign</code> specifies that the
same memory locations are to be used to hold the
values assigned by both statements <code>I = 3</code> and
<code>ASSIGN 10 TO I</code>, for example. 
(Normally, <code>g77</code> uses a separate memory location
to hold assigned statement labels.)

<p>See <a href="#Ugly%20Assigned%20Labels">Ugly Assigned Labels</a>, for more information.

</p><li><code>FORMAT</code> and <code>ENTRY</code> statements now are allowed to
precede <code>IMPLICIT NONE</code> statements.

<li>Produce diagnostic for unsupported <code>SELECT CASE</code> on
<code>CHARACTER</code> type, instead of crashing, at compile time.

<li>Fix crashes involving diagnosed or invalid code.

<li>Change approach to building <code>libf2c</code> archive
(<code>libf2c.a</code>) so that members are added to it
only when truly necessary, so the user that installs
an already-built <code>g77</code> doesn't need to have write
access to the build tree (whereas the user doing the
build might not have access to install new software
on the system).

<li>Support <code>gcc</code> version 2.7.2.2
(modified by <code>g77</code> into version 2.7.2.2.f.2),
and remove
support for prior versions of <code>gcc</code>.

<li>Upgrade to <code>libf2c</code> as of 1997-02-08, and
fix up some of the build procedures.

<li>Improve general build procedures for <code>g77</code>,
fixing minor bugs (such as deletion of any file
named <code>f771</code> in the parent directory of <code>gcc/</code>).

<li>Enable full support of <code>INTEGER(KIND=2)</code>
(often referred to as <code>INTEGER*8</code>)
available in
<code>libf2c</code> and <code>f2c.h</code> so that <code>f2c</code> users
may make full use of its features via the <code>g77</code>
version of <code>f2c.h</code> and the <code>INTEGER(KIND=2)</code>
support routines in the <code>g77</code> version of <code>libf2c</code>.

<li>Improve <code>g77</code> driver and <code>libf2c</code> so that <code>g77 -v</code>
yields version information on the library.

<li>The <code>SNGL</code> and <code>FLOAT</code> intrinsics now are
specific intrinsics, instead of synonyms for the
generic intrinsic <code>REAL</code>.

<li>New intrinsics have been added. 
These are <code>REALPART</code>, <code>IMAGPART</code>,
<code>COMPLEX</code>,
<code>LONG</code>, and <code>SHORT</code>.

<li>A new group of intrinsics, <code>gnu</code>, has been added
to contain the new <code>REALPART</code>, <code>IMAGPART</code>,
and <code>COMPLEX</code> intrinsics. 
An old group, <code>dcp</code>, has been removed.

<li>Complain about industry-wide ambiguous references
<code>REAL(<var>expr</var>)</code> and <code>AIMAG(<var>expr</var>)</code>,
where <var>expr</var> is <code>DOUBLE COMPLEX</code> (or any
complex type other than <code>COMPLEX</code>), unless
<code>-ff90</code> option specifies Fortran 90 interpretation
or new <code>-fugly-complex</code> option, in conjunction with
<code>-fnot-f90</code>, specifies <code>f2c</code> interpretation.

<li>Make improvements to diagnostics.

<li>Speed up compiler a bit.

<li>Improvements to documentation and indexing, including
a new chapter containing information on one, later
more, diagnostics that users are directed to pull
up automatically via a message in the diagnostic itself.

<p>(Hence the menu item <code>M</code> for the node
<code>Diagnostics</code> in the top-level menu of
the Info documentation.)

<h1>User-visible Changes</h1>

<p>This chapter describes changes to <code>g77</code> that are visible
to the programmers who actually write and maintain Fortran
code they compile with <code>g77</code>. 
Information on changes to installation procedures,
changes to the documentation, and bug fixes is
not provided here, unless it is likely to affect how
users use <code>g77</code>. 
See <a href="#News">News About GNU Fortran</a>, for information on
such changes to <code>g77</code>.

<p>Note that two variants of <code>g77</code> are tracked below. 
The <code>egcs</code> variant is described vis-a-vis
previous versions of <code>egcs</code> and/or
an official FSF version,
as appropriate.

<p>Therefore, <code>egcs</code> versions sometimes have multiple listings
to help clarify how they differ from other versions,
though this can make getting a complete picture
of what a particular <code>egcs</code> version contains
somewhat more difficult.

<p>For information on bugs in the GCC-2.95 version of <code>g77</code>,
see <a href="#Known%20Bugs">Known Bugs In GNU Fortran</a>.

<p>The following information was last updated on 1999-07-08:

<h2>In 0.5.25, <code>GCC</code> 2.95 (<code>EGCS</code> 1.2) versus <code>EGCS</code> 1.1.2:</h2>

<ul>

<li>The new <code>-fbounds-check</code> option
causes <code>g77</code> to compile run-time bounds checks
of array subscripts, as well as of substring start and end points.

<li><code>libg2c</code> now supports building as multilibbed library,
which provides better support for systems
that require options such as <code>-mieee</code>
to work properly.

<li>Source file names with the suffixes <code>.FOR</code> and <code>.FPP</code>
now are recognized by <code>g77</code>
as if they ended in <code>.for</code> and <code>.fpp</code>, respectively.

<li>The order of arguments to the <em>subroutine</em> forms of the
<code>CTime</code>, <code>DTime</code>, <code>ETime</code>, and <code>TtyNam</code>
intrinsics has been swapped. 
The argument serving as the returned value
for the corresponding function forms
now is the <em>second</em> argument,
making these consistent with the other subroutine forms
of <code>libU77</code> intrinsics.

<li><code>g77</code> now warns about a reference to an intrinsic
that has an interface that is not Year 2000 (Y2K) compliant. 
Also, <code>libg2c</code> has been changed to increase the likelihood
of catching references to the implementations of these intrinsics
using the <code>EXTERNAL</code> mechanism
(which would avoid the new warnings).

<p>See <a href="#Year%202000%20(Y2K)%20Problems">Year 2000 (Y2K) Problems</a>, for more information.

</p><li><code>-fno-emulate-complex</code> is now the default option. 
This should result in improved performance
of code that uses the <code>COMPLEX</code> data type.

<li>The <code>-malign-double</code> option
now reliably aligns <em>all</em> double-precision variables and arrays
on Intel x86 targets.

<li><code>g77</code> no longer generates code to maintain <code>errno</code>,
a C-language concept,
when performing operations such as the <code>SqRt</code> intrinsic.

<li>Support for the <code>-fugly</code> option has been removed.

</ul>

<h2>In 0.5.24 versus 0.5.23:</h2>

<p>There is no <code>g77</code> version 0.5.24 at this time,
or planned. 
0.5.24 is the version number designated for bug fixes and,
perhaps, some new features added,
to 0.5.23. 
Version 0.5.23 requires <code>gcc</code> 2.8.1,
as 0.5.24 was planned to require.

<p>Due to <code>EGCS</code> becoming <code>GCC</code>
(which is now an acronym for "GNU Compiler Collection"),
and <code>EGCS</code> 1.2 becoming officially designated <code>GCC</code> 2.95,
there seems to be no need for an actual 0.5.24 release.

<p>To reduce the confusion already resulting from use of 0.5.24
to designate <code>g77</code> versions within <code>EGCS</code> versions 1.0 and 1.1,
as well as in versions of <code>g77</code> documentation and notices
during that period,
"mainline" <code>g77</code> version numbering resumes
at 0.5.25 with <code>GCC</code> 2.95 (<code>EGCS</code> 1.2),
skipping over 0.5.24 as a placeholder version number.

<p>To repeat, there is no <code>g77</code> 0.5.24, but there is now a 0.5.25. 
Please remain calm and return to your keypunch units.

<h2>In <code>EGCS</code> 1.1.2 versus <code>EGCS</code> 1.1.1:</h2>

<h2>In <code>EGCS</code> 1.1.1 versus <code>EGCS</code> 1.1:</h2>

<h2>In <code>EGCS</code> 1.1 versus <code>EGCS</code> 1.0.3:</h2>

<ul>

<li>Support <code>FORMAT(I&lt;<var>expr</var>&gt;)</code> when <var>expr</var> is a
compile-time constant <code>INTEGER</code> expression.

<li>Fix <code>g77</code> <code>-g</code> option so procedures that
use <code>ENTRY</code> can be stepped through, line by line,
in <code>gdb</code>.

<li>Allow any <code>REAL</code> argument to intrinsics
<code>Second</code> and <code>CPU_Time</code>.

<li>Use <code>tempnam</code>, if available, to open scratch files
(as in <code>OPEN(STATUS='SCRATCH')</code>)
so that the <code>TMPDIR</code> environment variable,
if present, is used.

<li><code>g77</code>'s version of <code>libf2c</code> separates out
the setting of global state
(such as command-line arguments and signal handling)
from <code>main.o</code> into distinct, new library
archive members.

<p>This should make it easier to write portable applications
that have their own (non-Fortran) <code>main()</code> routine
properly set up the <code>libf2c</code> environment, even
when <code>libf2c</code> (now <code>libg2c</code>) is a shared library.

</p><li>The <code>g77</code> command now expects the run-time library
to be named <code>libg2c.a</code> instead of <code>libf2c.a</code>,
to ensure that a version other than the one built and
installed as part of the same <code>g77</code> version is picked up.

<li>Some diagnostics have been changed from warnings to errors,
to prevent inadvertent use of the resulting, probably buggy,
programs. 
These mostly include diagnostics about use of unsupported features
in the <code>OPEN</code>, <code>INQUIRE</code>, <code>READ</code>, and
<code>WRITE</code> statements,
and about truncations of various sorts of constants.

</ul>

<h2>In <code>EGCS</code> 1.1 versus <code>g77</code> 0.5.23:</h2>

<ul>

<li><code>g77</code> now treats <code>%LOC(<var>expr</var>)</code> and
<code>LOC(<var>expr</var>)</code> as "ordinary" expressions
when they are used as arguments in procedure calls. 
This change applies only to global (filewide) analysis,
making it consistent with
how <code>g77</code> actually generates code
for these cases.

<p>Previously, <code>g77</code> treated these expressions
as denoting special "pointer" arguments
for the purposes of filewide analysis.

</p><li>Align static double-precision variables and arrays
on Intel x86 targets
regardless of whether <code>-malign-double</code> is specified.

<p>Generally, this affects only local variables and arrays
having the <code>SAVE</code> attribute
or given initial values via <code>DATA</code>.

</p><li>The <code>g77</code> driver now ensures that <code>-lg2c</code>
is specified in the link phase prior to any
occurrence of <code>-lm</code>. 
This prevents accidentally linking to a routine
in the SunOS4 <code>-lm</code> library
when the generated code wants to link to the one
in <code>libf2c</code> (<code>libg2c</code>).

<li><code>g77</code> emits more debugging information when
<code>-g</code> is used.

<p>This new information allows, for example,
<kbd>which __g77_length_a</kbd> to be used in <code>gdb</code>
to determine the type of the phantom length argument
supplied with <code>CHARACTER</code> variables.

<p>This information pertains to internally-generated
type, variable, and other information,
not to the longstanding deficiencies vis-a-vis
<code>COMMON</code> and <code>EQUIVALENCE</code>.

</p><li>The F90 <code>Date_and_Time</code> intrinsic now is
supported.

<li>The F90 <code>System_Clock</code> intrinsic allows
the optional arguments (except for the <code>Count</code>
argument) to be omitted.

</ul>

<h2>In 0.5.23 versus 0.5.22:</h2>

<ul>
<li>This release contains several regressions against
version 0.5.22 of <code>g77</code>, due to using the
"vanilla" <code>gcc</code> back end instead of patching
it to fix a few bugs and improve performance in a
few cases.

<p>Features that have been dropped from this version
of <code>g77</code> due to their being implemented
via <code>g77</code>-specific patches to the <code>gcc</code>
back end in previous releases include:

<ul>
<li>Support for <code>__restrict__</code> keyword,
the options <code>-fargument-alias</code>, <code>-fargument-noalias</code>,
and <code>-fargument-noalias-global</code>,
and the corresponding alias-analysis code.

<p>(<code>egcs</code> has the alias-analysis
code, but not the <code>__restrict__</code> keyword. 
<code>egcs</code> <code>g77</code> users benefit from the alias-analysis
code despite the lack of the <code>__restrict__</code> keyword,
which is a C-language construct.)

</p><li>Support for the GNU compiler options
<code>-fmove-all-movables</code>,
<code>-freduce-all-givs</code>,
and <code>-frerun-loop-opt</code>.

<p>(<code>egcs</code> supports these options. 
<code>g77</code> users of <code>egcs</code> benefit from them even if
they are not explicitly specified,
because the defaults are optimized for <code>g77</code> users.)

</p><li>Support for the <code>-W</code> option warning about
integer division by zero.

<li>The Intel x86-specific option <code>-malign-double</code>
applying to stack-allocated data
as well as statically-allocate data. 
</ul>

<li>Support <code>gcc</code> version 2.8,
and remove support for prior versions of <code>gcc</code>.

<li>Remove support for the <code>--driver</code> option,
as <code>g77</code> now does all the driving,
just like <code>gcc</code>.

<li>The <code>g77</code> command now expects the run-time library
to be named <code>libg2c.a</code> instead of <code>libf2c.a</code>,
to ensure that a version other than the one built and
installed as part of the same <code>g77</code> version is picked up.

<li><code>g77</code>'s version of <code>libf2c</code> separates out
the setting of global state
(such as command-line arguments and signal handling)
from <code>main.o</code> into distinct, new library
archive members.

<p>This should make it easier to write portable applications
that have their own (non-Fortran) <code>main()</code> routine
properly set up the <code>libf2c</code> environment, even
when <code>libf2c</code> (now <code>libg2c</code>) is a shared library.

</p><li>Some diagnostics have been changed from warnings to errors,
to prevent inadvertent use of the resulting, probably buggy,
programs. 
These mostly include diagnostics about use of unsupported features
in the <code>OPEN</code>, <code>INQUIRE</code>, <code>READ</code>, and
<code>WRITE</code> statements,
and about truncations of various sorts of constants.

</ul>

<h2>In 0.5.22 versus 0.5.21:</h2>

<ul>

<li>Fix <code>Signal</code> intrinsic so it offers portable
support for 64-bit systems (such as Digital Alphas
running GNU/Linux).

<li>Support <code>FORMAT(I&lt;<var>expr</var>&gt;)</code> when <var>expr</var> is a
compile-time constant <code>INTEGER</code> expression.

<li>Fix <code>g77</code> <code>-g</code> option so procedures that
use <code>ENTRY</code> can be stepped through, line by line,
in <code>gdb</code>.

<li>Allow any <code>REAL</code> argument to intrinsics
<code>Second</code> and <code>CPU_Time</code>.

<li>Allow any numeric argument to intrinsics
<code>Int2</code> and <code>Int8</code>.

<li>Use <code>tempnam</code>, if available, to open scratch files
(as in <code>OPEN(STATUS='SCRATCH')</code>)
so that the <code>TMPDIR</code> environment variable,
if present, is used.

<li>Rename the <code>gcc</code> keyword <code>restrict</code> to
<code>__restrict__</code>, to avoid rejecting valid, existing,
C programs. 
Support for <code>restrict</code> is now more like support
for <code>complex</code>.

<li>Fix <code>-fugly-comma</code> to affect invocations of
only external procedures. 
Restore rejection of gratuitous trailing omitted
arguments to intrinsics, as in <code>I=MAX(3,4,,)</code>.

<li>Fix compiler so it accepts <code>-fgnu-intrinsics-*</code> and
<code>-fbadu77-intrinsics-*</code> options.

</ul>

<h2>In <code>EGCS</code> 1.0.2 versus <code>EGCS</code> 1.0.1:</h2>

<ul>

<li>Fix compiler so it accepts <code>-fgnu-intrinsics-*</code> and
<code>-fbadu77-intrinsics-*</code> options. 
</ul>

<h2>In <code>EGCS</code> 1.0.1 versus <code>EGCS</code> 1.0:</h2>

<h2>In <code>EGCS</code> 1.0 versus <code>g77</code> 0.5.21:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Version 1.0 of <code>egcs</code>
contains several regressions against
version 0.5.21 of <code>g77</code>,
due to using the
"vanilla" <code>gcc</code> back end instead of patching
it to fix a few bugs and improve performance in a
few cases.

<p>Features that have been dropped from this version
of <code>g77</code> due to their being implemented
via <code>g77</code>-specific patches to the <code>gcc</code>
back end in previous releases include:

<ul>
<li>Support for the C-language <code>restrict</code> keyword.

<li>Support for the <code>-W</code> option warning about
integer division by zero.

<li>The Intel x86-specific option <code>-malign-double</code>
applying to stack-allocated data
as well as statically-allocate data. 
</ul>

<li>Remove support for the <code>--driver</code> option,
as <code>g77</code> now does all the driving,
just like <code>gcc</code>.

<li>Allow any numeric argument to intrinsics
<code>Int2</code> and <code>Int8</code>.

</ul>

<h2>In 0.5.21:</h2>

<ul>

<li>When the <code>-W</code> option is specified, <code>gcc</code>, <code>g77</code>,
and other GNU compilers that incorporate the <code>gcc</code>
back end as modified by <code>g77</code>, issue
a warning about integer division by constant zero.

<li>New option <code>-Wno-globals</code> disables warnings
about "suspicious" use of a name both as a global
name and as the implicit name of an intrinsic, and
warnings about disagreements over the number or natures of
arguments passed to global procedures, or the
natures of the procedures themselves.

<p>The default is to issue such warnings, which are
new as of this version of <code>g77</code>.

</p><li>New option <code>-fno-globals</code> disables diagnostics
about potentially fatal disagreements
analysis problems, such as disagreements over the
number or natures of arguments passed to global
procedures, or the natures of those procedures themselves.

<p>The default is to issue such diagnostics and flag
the compilation as unsuccessful. 
With this option, the diagnostics are issued as
warnings, or, if <code>-Wno-globals</code> is specified,
are not issued at all.

<p>This option also disables inlining of global procedures,
to avoid compiler crashes resulting from coding errors
that these diagnostics normally would identify.

</p><li>Fix <code>libU77</code> routines that accept file and other names
to strip trailing blanks from them, for consistency
with other implementations. 
Blanks may be forcibly appended to such names by
appending a single null character (<code>CHAR(0)</code>)
to the significant trailing blanks.

<li>Fix <code>CHMOD</code> intrinsic to work with file names
that have embedded blanks, commas, and so on.

<li>Fix <code>SIGNAL</code> intrinsic so it accepts an
optional third <code>Status</code> argument.

<li>Make many changes to <code>libU77</code> intrinsics to
support existing code more directly.

<p>Such changes include allowing both subroutine and
function forms of many routines, changing <code>MCLOCK()</code>
and <code>TIME()</code> to return <code>INTEGER(KIND=1)</code> values,
introducing <code>MCLOCK8()</code> and <code>TIME8()</code> to
return <code>INTEGER(KIND=2)</code> values,
and placing functions that are intended to perform
side effects in a new intrinsic group, <code>badu77</code>.

</p><li>Add options <code>-fbadu77-intrinsics-delete</code>,
<code>-fbadu77-intrinsics-hide</code>, and so on.

<li>Add <code>INT2</code> and <code>INT8</code> intrinsics.

<li>Add <code>CPU_TIME</code> intrinsic.

<li>Add <code>ALARM</code> intrinsic.

<li><code>CTIME</code> intrinsic now accepts any <code>INTEGER</code>
argument, not just <code>INTEGER(KIND=2)</code>.

<li><code>g77</code> driver now prints version information (such as produced
by <kbd>g77 -v</kbd>) to <code>stderr</code> instead of <code>stdout</code>.

<li>The <code>.r</code> suffix now designates a Ratfor source file,
to be preprocessed via the <code>ratfor</code> command, available
separately.

</ul>

<h2>In 0.5.20:</h2>

<ul>
<li>The <code>-fno-typeless-boz</code> option is now the default.

<p>This option specifies that non-decimal-radix
constants using the prefixed-radix form (such as <code>Z'1234'</code>)
are to be interpreted as <code>INTEGER(KIND=1)</code> constants. 
Specify <code>-ftypeless-boz</code> to cause such
constants to be interpreted as typeless.

<p>(Version 0.5.19 introduced <code>-fno-typeless-boz</code> and
its inverse.)

<p>See <a href="#Fortran%20Dialect%20Options">Options Controlling Fortran Dialect</a>,
for information on the <code>-ftypeless-boz</code> option.

</p><li>Options <code>-ff90-intrinsics-enable</code> and
<code>-fvxt-intrinsics-enable</code> now are the
defaults.

<p>Some programs might use names that clash with
intrinsic names defined (and now enabled) by these
options or by the new <code>libU77</code> intrinsics. 
Users of such programs might need to compile them
differently (using, for example, <code>-ff90-intrinsics-disable</code>)
or, better yet, insert appropriate <code>EXTERNAL</code>
statements specifying that these names are not intended
to be names of intrinsics.

</p><li>The <code>ALWAYS_FLUSH</code> macro is no longer defined when
building <code>libf2c</code>, which should result in improved
I/O performance, especially over NFS.

<p><em>Note:</em> If you have code that depends on the behavior
of <code>libf2c</code> when built with <code>ALWAYS_FLUSH</code> defined,
you will have to modify <code>libf2c</code> accordingly before
building it from this and future versions of <code>g77</code>.

<p>See <a href="#Output%20Assumed%20To%20Flush">Output Assumed To Flush</a>, for more information.

</p><li>Dave Love's implementation of <code>libU77</code> has been
added to the version of <code>libf2c</code> distributed with
and built as part of <code>g77</code>. 
<code>g77</code> now knows about the routines in this library
as intrinsics.

<li>New option <code>-fvxt</code> specifies that the
source file is written in VXT Fortran, instead of GNU Fortran.

<p>See <a href="#VXT%20Fortran">VXT Fortran</a>, for more information on the constructs
recognized when the <code>-fvxt</code> option is specified.

</p><li>The <code>-fvxt-not-f90</code> option has been deleted,
along with its inverse, <code>-ff90-not-vxt</code>.

<p>If you used one of these deleted options, you should
re-read the pertinent documentation to determine which
options, if any, are appropriate for compiling your
code with this version of <code>g77</code>.

<p>See <a href="#Other%20Dialects">Other Dialects</a>, for more information.

</p><li>The <code>-fugly</code> option now issues a warning, as it
likely will be removed in a future version.

<p>(Enabling all the <code>-fugly-*</code> options is unlikely
to be feasible, or sensible, in the future,
so users should learn to specify only those
<code>-fugly-*</code> options they really need for a
particular source file.)

</p><li>The <code>-fugly-assumed</code> option, introduced in
version 0.5.19, has been changed to
better accommodate old and new code.

<p>See <a href="#Ugly%20Assumed-Size%20Arrays">Ugly Assumed-Size Arrays</a>, for more information.

</p><li>Related to supporting Alpha (AXP) machines, the <code>LOC()</code>
intrinsic and <code>%LOC()</code> construct now return
values of <code>INTEGER(KIND=0)</code> type,
as defined by the GNU Fortran language.

<p>This type is wide enough
(holds the same number of bits)
as the character-pointer type on the machine.

<p>On most machines, this won't make a difference,
whereas, on Alphas and other systems with 64-bit pointers,
the <code>INTEGER(KIND=0)</code> type is equivalent to <code>INTEGER(KIND=2)</code>
(often referred to as <code>INTEGER*8</code>)
instead of the more common <code>INTEGER(KIND=1)</code>
(often referred to as <code>INTEGER*4</code>).

</p><li>Emulate <code>COMPLEX</code> arithmetic in the <code>g77</code> front
end, to avoid bugs in <code>complex</code> support in the
<code>gcc</code> back end. 
New option <code>-fno-emulate-complex</code>
causes <code>g77</code> to revert the 0.5.19 behavior.

<li>Dummy arguments are no longer assumed to potentially alias
(overlap)
other dummy arguments or <code>COMMON</code> areas when any of
these are defined (assigned to) by Fortran code.

<p>This can result in faster and/or smaller programs when
compiling with optimization enabled, though on some
systems this effect is observed only when <code>-fforce-addr</code>
also is specified.

<p>New options <code>-falias-check</code>, <code>-fargument-alias</code>,
<code>-fargument-noalias</code>,
and <code>-fno-argument-noalias-global</code> control the
way <code>g77</code> handles potential aliasing.

<p>See <a href="#Aliasing%20Assumed%20To%20Work">Aliasing Assumed To Work</a>, for detailed information on why the
new defaults might result in some programs no longer working the way they
did when compiled by previous versions of <code>g77</code>.

</p><li>New option <code>-fugly-assign</code> specifies that the
same memory locations are to be used to hold the
values assigned by both statements <code>I = 3</code> and
<code>ASSIGN 10 TO I</code>, for example. 
(Normally, <code>g77</code> uses a separate memory location
to hold assigned statement labels.)

<p>See <a href="#Ugly%20Assigned%20Labels">Ugly Assigned Labels</a>, for more information.

</p><li><code>FORMAT</code> and <code>ENTRY</code> statements now are allowed to
precede <code>IMPLICIT NONE</code> statements.

<li>Enable full support of <code>INTEGER(KIND=2)</code>
(often referred to as <code>INTEGER*8</code>)
available in
<code>libf2c</code> and <code>f2c.h</code> so that <code>f2c</code> users
may make full use of its features via the <code>g77</code>
version of <code>f2c.h</code> and the <code>INTEGER(KIND=2)</code>
support routines in the <code>g77</code> version of <code>libf2c</code>.

<li>Improve <code>g77</code> driver and <code>libf2c</code> so that <code>g77 -v</code>
yields version information on the library.

<li>The <code>SNGL</code> and <code>FLOAT</code> intrinsics now are
specific intrinsics, instead of synonyms for the
generic intrinsic <code>REAL</code>.

<li>New intrinsics have been added. 
These are <code>REALPART</code>, <code>IMAGPART</code>,
<code>COMPLEX</code>,
<code>LONG</code>, and <code>SHORT</code>.

<li>A new group of intrinsics, <code>gnu</code>, has been added
to contain the new <code>REALPART</code>, <code>IMAGPART</code>,
and <code>COMPLEX</code> intrinsics. 
An old group, <code>dcp</code>, has been removed.

<li>Complain about industry-wide ambiguous references
<code>REAL(<var>expr</var>)</code> and <code>AIMAG(<var>expr</var>)</code>,
where <var>expr</var> is <code>DOUBLE COMPLEX</code> (or any
complex type other than <code>COMPLEX</code>), unless
<code>-ff90</code> option specifies Fortran 90 interpretation
or new <code>-fugly-complex</code> option, in conjunction with
<code>-fnot-f90</code>, specifies <code>f2c</code> interpretation.

<h1>The GNU Fortran Language</h1>

<p>GNU Fortran supports a variety of extensions to, and dialects
of, the Fortran language. 
Its primary base is the ANSI FORTRAN 77 standard, currently available on
the network at
<a href="http://www.fortran.com/fortran/F77_std/rjcnf0001.html">http://www.fortran.com/fortran/F77_std/rjcnf0001.html</a>
or as monolithic text at
<a href="http://www.fortran.com/fortran/F77_std/f77_std.html">http://www.fortran.com/fortran/F77_std/f77_std.html</a>. 
It offers some extensions that are popular among users
of UNIX <code>f77</code> and <code>f2c</code> compilers, some that
are popular among users of other compilers (such as Digital
products), some that are popular among users of the
newer Fortran 90 standard, and some that are introduced
by GNU Fortran.

<p>(If you need a text on Fortran,
a few freely available electronic references have pointers from
<a href="http://www.fortran.com/fortran/Books/">http://www.fortran.com/fortran/Books/</a>.  There is a `cooperative
net project', <cite>User Notes on Fortran Programming</cite> at
<a href="ftp://vms.huji.ac.il/fortran/">ftp://vms.huji.ac.il/fortran/</a> and mirrors elsewhere; some of this
material might not apply specifically to <code>g77</code>.)

<p>Part of what defines a particular implementation of a Fortran
system, such as <code>g77</code>, is the particular characteristics
of how it supports types, constants, and so on. 
Much of this is left up to the implementation by the various
Fortran standards and accepted practice in the industry.

<p>The GNU Fortran <em>language</em> is described below. 
Much of the material is organized along the same lines
as the ANSI FORTRAN 77 standard itself.

<p>See <a href="#Other%20Dialects">Other Dialects</a>, for information on features <code>g77</code> supports
that are not part of the GNU Fortran language.

<p><em>Note</em>: This portion of the documentation definitely needs a lot
of work!

<h2>Direction of Language Development</h2>

<p>The purpose of the following description of the GNU Fortran
language is to promote wide portability of GNU Fortran programs.

<p>GNU Fortran is an evolving language, due to the
fact that <code>g77</code> itself is in beta test. 
Some current features of the language might later
be redefined as dialects of Fortran supported by <code>g77</code>
when better ways to express these features are added to <code>g77</code>,
for example. 
Such features would still be supported by
<code>g77</code>, but would be available only when
one or more command-line options were used.

<p>The GNU Fortran <em>language</em> is distinct from the
GNU Fortran <em>compilation system</em> (<code>g77</code>).

<p>For example, <code>g77</code> supports various dialects of
Fortran--in a sense, these are languages other than
GNU Fortran--though its primary
purpose is to support the GNU Fortran language, which also is
described in its documentation and by its implementation.

<p>On the other hand, non-GNU compilers might offer
support for the GNU Fortran language, and are encouraged
to do so.

<p>Currently, the GNU Fortran language is a fairly fuzzy object. 
It represents something of a cross between what <code>g77</code> accepts
when compiling using the prevailing defaults and what this
document describes as being part of the language.

<p>Future versions of <code>g77</code> are expected to clarify the
definition of the language in the documentation. 
Often, this will mean adding new features to the language, in the form
of both new documentation and new support in <code>g77</code>. 
However, it might occasionally mean removing a feature
from the language itself to "dialect" status. 
In such a case, the documentation would be adjusted
to reflect the change, and <code>g77</code> itself would likely be changed
to require one or more command-line options to continue supporting
the feature.

<p>The development of the GNU Fortran language is intended to strike
a balance between:

<ul>
<li>Serving as a mostly-upwards-compatible language from the
de facto UNIX Fortran dialect as supported by <code>f77</code>.

<li>Offering new, well-designed language features. 
Attributes of such features include
not making existing code any harder to read
(for those who might be unaware that the new
features are not in use) and
not making state-of-the-art
compilers take longer to issue diagnostics,
among others.

<li>Supporting existing, well-written code without gratuitously
rejecting non-standard constructs, regardless of the origin
of the code (its dialect).

<li>Offering default behavior and command-line options to reduce
and, where reasonable, eliminate the need for programmers to make
any modifications to code that already works in existing
production environments.

<li>Diagnosing constructs that have different meanings in different
systems, languages, and dialects, while offering clear,
less ambiguous ways to express each of the different meanings
so programmers can change their code appropriately. 
</ul>

<p>One of the biggest practical challenges for the developers of the
GNU Fortran language is meeting the sometimes contradictory demands
of the above items.

<p>For example, a feature might be widely used in one popular environment,
but the exact same code that utilizes that feature might not work
as expected--perhaps it might mean something entirely different--in
another popular environment.

<p>Traditionally, Fortran compilers--even portable ones--have solved this
problem by simply offering the appropriate feature to users of
the respective systems. 
This approach treats users of various Fortran systems and dialects
as remote "islands", or camps, of programmers, and assume that these
camps rarely come into contact with each other (or,
especially, with each other's code).

<p>Project GNU takes a radically different approach to software and language
design, in that it assumes that users of GNU software do not necessarily
care what kind of underlying system they are using, regardless
of whether they are using software (at the user-interface
level) or writing it (for example, writing Fortran or C code).

<p>As such, GNU users rarely need consider just what kind of underlying
hardware (or, in many cases, operating system) they are using at any
particular time. 
They can use and write software designed for a general-purpose,
widely portable, heterogenous environment--the GNU environment.

<p>In line with this philosophy, GNU Fortran must evolve into a product
that is widely ported and portable not only in the sense that it can
be successfully built, installed, and run by users, but in the larger
sense that its users can use it in the same way, and expect largely the
same behaviors from it, regardless of the kind of system they are using
at any particular time.

<p>This approach constrains the solutions <code>g77</code> can use to resolve
conflicts between various camps of Fortran users. 
If these two camps disagree about what a particular construct should
mean, <code>g77</code> cannot simply be changed to treat that particular construct as
having one meaning without comment (such as a warning), lest the users
expecting it to have the other meaning are unpleasantly surprised that
their code misbehaves when executed.

<p>The use of the ASCII backslash character in character constants is
an excellent (and still somewhat unresolved) example of this kind of
controversy. 
See <a href="#Backslash%20in%20Constants">Backslash in Constants</a>. 
Other examples are likely to arise in the future, as <code>g77</code> developers
strive to improve its ability to accept an ever-wider variety of existing
Fortran code without requiring significant modifications to said code.

<p>Development of GNU Fortran is further constrained by the desire
to avoid requiring programmers to change their code. 
This is important because it allows programmers, administrators,
and others to more faithfully evaluate and validate <code>g77</code>
(as an overall product and as new versions are distributed)
without having to support multiple versions of their programs
so that they continue to work the same way on their existing
systems (non-GNU perhaps, but possibly also earlier versions
of <code>g77</code>).

<h2>ANSI FORTRAN 77 Standard Support</h2>

<p>GNU Fortran supports ANSI FORTRAN 77 with the following caveats. 
In summary, the only ANSI FORTRAN 77 features <code>g77</code> doesn't
support are those that are probably rarely used in actual code,
some of which are explicitly disallowed by the Fortran 90 standard.

<ul>
<li><a href="#No%20Passing%20External%20Assumed-length">No Passing External Assumed-length</a>:   CHAR*(*) CFUNC restriction.

<br>

<h3>No Passing External Assumed-length</h3>

<p><code>g77</code> disallows passing of an external procedure
as an actual argument if the procedure's
type is declared <code>CHARACTER*(*)</code>.  For example:

<pre>CHARACTER*(*) CFUNC
EXTERNAL CFUNC
CALL FOO(CFUNC)
END
</pre>

<p>It isn't clear whether the standard considers this conforming.

<h3>No Passing Dummy Assumed-length</h3>

<p><code>g77</code> disallows passing of a dummy procedure
as an actual argument if the procedure's
type is declared <code>CHARACTER*(*)</code>.

<pre>SUBROUTINE BAR(CFUNC)
CHARACTER*(*) CFUNC
EXTERNAL CFUNC
CALL FOO(CFUNC)

</pre>

<p>It isn't clear whether the standard considers this conforming.

<br>

<h3>No Pathological Implied-DO</h3>

<p>The <code>DO</code> variable for an implied-<code>DO</code> construct in a
<code>DATA</code> statement may not be used as the <code>DO</code> variable
for an outer implied-<code>DO</code> construct.  For example, this
fragment is disallowed by <code>g77</code>:

<pre>DATA ((A(I, I), I= 1, 10), I= 1, 10) /<small>...</small>/
</pre>

<p>This also is disallowed by Fortran 90, as it offers no additional
capabilities and would have a variety of possible meanings.

<p>Note that it is <em>very</em> unlikely that any production Fortran code
tries to use this unsupported construct.

Up:<a rel=up href="#Standard%20Support">Standard Support</a>
<br>

<h3>No Useless Implied-DO</h3>

<p>An array element initializer in an implied-<code>DO</code> construct in a
<code>DATA</code> statement must contain at least one reference to the <code>DO</code>
variables of each outer implied-<code>DO</code> construct.  For example,
this fragment is disallowed by <code>g77</code>:

<pre>DATA (A, I= 1, 1) /1./
</pre>

<p>This also is disallowed by Fortran 90, as FORTRAN 77's more permissive
requirements offer no additional capabilities. 
However, <code>g77</code> doesn't necessarily diagnose all cases
where this requirement is not met.

<p>Note that it is <em>very</em> unlikely that any production Fortran code
tries to use this unsupported construct.

<h2>Conformance</h2>

<p>(The following information augments or overrides the information in
Section 1.4 of ANSI X3.9-1978 FORTRAN 77 in specifying the GNU Fortran
language. 
Chapter 1 of that document otherwise serves as the basis
for the relevant aspects of GNU Fortran.)

<p>The definition of the GNU Fortran language is akin to that of
the ANSI FORTRAN 77 language in that it does not generally require
conforming implementations to diagnose cases where programs do
not conform to the language.

<p>However, <code>g77</code> as a compiler is being developed in a way that
is intended to enable it to diagnose such cases in an easy-to-understand
manner.

<p>A program that conforms to the GNU Fortran language should, when
compiled, linked, and executed using a properly installed <code>g77</code>
system, perform as described by the GNU Fortran language definition. 
Reasons for different behavior include, among others:

<ul>
<li>Use of resources (memory--heap, stack, and so on; disk space; CPU
time; etc.) exceeds those of the system.

<li>Range and/or precision of calculations required by the program
exceeds that of the system.

<li>Excessive reliance on behaviors that are system-dependent
(non-portable Fortran code).

<li>Bugs in the program.

<li>Bug in <code>g77</code>.

<li>Bugs in the system. 
</ul>

<p>Despite these "loopholes", the availability of a clear specification
of the language of programs submitted to <code>g77</code>, as this document
is intended to provide, is considered an important aspect of providing
a robust, clean, predictable Fortran implementation.

<p>The definition of the GNU Fortran language, while having no special
legal status, can therefore be viewed as a sort of contract, or agreement. 
This agreement says, in essence, "if you write a program in this language,
and run it in an environment (such as a <code>g77</code> system) that supports
this language, the program should behave in a largely predictable way".

<h2>Notation Used in This Chapter</h2>

<p>(The following information augments or overrides the information in
Section 1.5 of ANSI X3.9-1978 FORTRAN 77 in specifying the GNU Fortran
language. 
Chapter 1 of that document otherwise serves as the basis
for the relevant aspects of GNU Fortran.)

<p>In this chapter, "must" denotes a requirement, "may" denotes permission,
and "must not" and "may not" denote prohibition. 
Terms such as "might", "should", and "can" generally add little or
nothing in the way of weight to the GNU Fortran language itself,
but are used to explain or illustrate the language.

<p>For example:

<pre>``The <code>FROBNITZ</code> statement must precede all executable
statements in a program unit, and may not specify any dummy
arguments.  It may specify local or common variables and arrays.
Its use should be limited to portions of the program designed to
be non-portable and system-specific, because it might cause the
containing program unit to behave quite differently on different
systems.''
</pre>

<p>Insofar as the GNU Fortran language is specified,
the requirements and permissions denoted by the above sample statement
are limited to the placement of the statement and the kinds of
things it may specify. 
The rest of the statement--the content regarding non-portable portions
of the program and the differing behavior of program units containing
the <code>FROBNITZ</code> statement--does not pertain the GNU Fortran
language itself. 
That content offers advice and warnings about the <code>FROBNITZ</code>
statement.

<p><em>Remember:</em> The GNU Fortran language definition specifies
both what constitutes a valid GNU Fortran program and how,
given such a program, a valid GNU Fortran implementation is
to interpret that program.

<p>It is <em>not</em> incumbent upon a valid GNU Fortran implementation
to behave in any particular way, any consistent way, or any
predictable way when it is asked to interpret input that is
<em>not</em> a valid GNU Fortran program.

<p>Such input is said to have <dfn>undefined</dfn> behavior when
interpreted by a valid GNU Fortran implementation, though
an implementation may choose to specify behaviors for some
cases of inputs that are not valid GNU Fortran programs.

<p>Other notation used herein is that of the GNU texinfo format,
which is used to generate printed hardcopy, on-line hypertext
(Info), and on-line HTML versions, all from a single source
document. 
This notation is used as follows:

<ul>
<li>Keywords defined by the GNU Fortran language are shown
in uppercase, as in: <code>COMMON</code>, <code>INTEGER</code>, and
<code>BLOCK DATA</code>.

<p>Note that, in practice, many Fortran programs are written
in lowercase--uppercase is used in this manual as a
means to readily distinguish keywords and sample Fortran-related
text from the prose in this document.

</p><li>Portions of actual sample program, input, or output text
look like this: <code>Actual program text</code>.

<p>Generally, uppercase is used for all Fortran-specific and
Fortran-related text, though this does not always include
literal text within Fortran code.

<p>For example: <code>PRINT *, 'My name is Bob'</code>.

</p><li>A metasyntactic variable--that is, a name used in this document
to serve as a placeholder for whatever text is used by the
user or programmer--appears as shown in the following example:

<p>"The <code>INTEGER <var>ivar</var></code> statement specifies that
<var>ivar</var> is a variable or array of type <code>INTEGER</code>."

<p>In the above example, any valid text may be substituted for
the metasyntactic variable <var>ivar</var> to make the statement
apply to a specific instance, as long as the same text is
substituted for <em>both</em> occurrences of <var>ivar</var>.

</p><li>Ellipses ("<small>...</small>") are used to indicate further text that
is either unimportant or expanded upon further, elsewhere.

<li>Names of data types are in the style of Fortran 90, in most
cases.

<p>See <a href="#Kind%20Notation">Kind Notation</a>, for information on the relationship
between Fortran 90 nomenclature (such as <code>INTEGER(KIND=1)</code>)
and the more traditional, less portably concise nomenclature
(such as <code>INTEGER*4</code>).

<h3>Syntactic Items</h3>

<p>(Corresponds to Section 2.2 of ANSI X3.9-1978 FORTRAN 77.)

<p>In GNU Fortran, a symbolic name is at least one character long,
and has no arbitrary upper limit on length. 
However, names of entities requiring external linkage (such as
external functions, external subroutines, and <code>COMMON</code> areas)
might be restricted to some arbitrary length by the system. 
Such a restriction is no more constrained than that of one
through six characters.

<p>Underscores (<code>_</code>) are accepted in symbol names after the first
character (which must be a letter).

<h3>Statements, Comments, and Lines</h3>

<p>(Corresponds to Section 2.3 of ANSI X3.9-1978 FORTRAN 77.)

<p>Use of an exclamation point (<code>!</code>) to begin a
trailing comment (a comment that extends to the end of the same
source line) is permitted under the following conditions:

<ul>
<li>The exclamation point does not appear in column 6. 
Otherwise, it is treated as an indicator of a continuation
line.

<li>The exclamation point appears outside a character or Hollerith
constant. 
Otherwise, the exclamation point is considered part of the
constant.

<li>The exclamation point appears to the left of any other possible
trailing comment. 
That is, a trailing comment may contain exclamation points
in their commentary text. 
</ul>

<p>Use of a semicolon (<code>;</code>) as a statement separator
is permitted under the following conditions:

<ul>
<li>The semicolon appears outside a character or Hollerith
constant. 
Otherwise, the semicolon is considered part of the
constant.

<li>The semicolon appears to the left of a trailing comment. 
Otherwise, the semicolon is considered part of that
comment.

<li>Neither a logical <code>IF</code> statement nor a non-construct
<code>WHERE</code> statement (a Fortran 90 feature) may be
followed (in the same, possibly continued, line) by
a semicolon used as a statement separator.

<p>This restriction avoids the confusion
that can result when reading a line such as:

<pre>IF (VALIDP) CALL FOO; CALL BAR
</pre>

<p>Some readers might think the <code>CALL BAR</code> is executed
only if <code>VALIDP</code> is <code>.TRUE.</code>, while others might
assume its execution is unconditional.

<p>(At present, <code>g77</code> does not diagnose code that
violates this restriction.)

<h3>GNU Fortran Character Set</h3>

<p>(Corresponds to Section 3.1 of ANSI X3.9-1978 FORTRAN 77.)

<p>Letters include uppercase letters (the twenty-six characters
of the English alphabet) and lowercase letters (their lowercase
equivalent). 
Generally, lowercase letters may be used in place of uppercase
letters, though in character and Hollerith constants, they
are distinct.

<p>Special characters include:

<ul>
<li>Semicolon (<code>;</code>)

<li>Exclamation point (<code>!</code>)

<li>Double quote (<code>"</code>)

<li>Backslash (<code>\</code>)

<li>Question mark (<code>?</code>)

<li>Hash mark (<code>#</code>)

<li>Ampersand (<code>&amp;</code>)

<li>Percent sign (<code>%</code>)

<li>Underscore (<code>_</code>)

<li>Open angle (<code>&lt;</code>)

<li>Close angle (<code>&gt;</code>)

<li>The FORTRAN 77 special characters (&lt;SPC&gt;, <code>=</code>,
<code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>/</code>, <code>(</code>,
<code>)</code>, <code>,</code>, <code>.</code>, <code>$</code>, <code>'</code>,
and <code>:</code>)
</ul>

<p>Note that this document refers to &lt;SPC&gt; as <dfn>space</dfn>,
while X3.9-1978 FORTRAN 77 refers to it as <dfn>blank</dfn>.

<h3>Lines</h3>

<p>(Corresponds to Section 3.2 of ANSI X3.9-1978 FORTRAN 77.)

<p>The way a Fortran compiler views source files depends entirely on the
implementation choices made for the compiler, since those choices
are explicitly left to the implementation by the published Fortran
standards.

<p>The GNU Fortran language mandates a view applicable to UNIX-like
text files--files that are made up of an arbitrary number of lines,
each with an arbitrary number of characters (sometimes called stream-based
files).

<p>This view does not apply to types of files that are specified as
having a particular number of characters on every single line (sometimes
referred to as record-based files).

<p>Because a "line in a program unit is a sequence of 72 characters",
to quote X3.9-1978, the GNU Fortran language specifies that a
stream-based text file is translated to GNU Fortran lines as follows:

<ul>
<li>A newline in the file is the character that represents the end of
a line of text to the underlying system. 
For example, on ASCII-based systems, a newline is the &lt;NL&gt;
character, which has ASCII value 10 (decimal).

<li>Each newline in the file serves to end the line of text that precedes
it (and that does not contain a newline).

<li>The end-of-file marker (<code>EOF</code>) also serves to end the line
of text that precedes it (and that does not contain a newline).

<li>Any line of text that is shorter than 72 characters is padded to that length
with spaces (called "blanks" in the standard).

<li>Any line of text that is longer than 72 characters is truncated to that
length, but the truncated remainder must consist entirely of spaces.

<li>Characters other than newline and the GNU Fortran character set
are invalid. 
</ul>

<p>For the purposes of the remainder of this description of the GNU
Fortran language, the translation described above has already
taken place, unless otherwise specified.

<p>The result of the above translation is that the source file appears,
in terms of the remainder of this description of the GNU Fortran language,
as if it had an arbitrary
number of 72-character lines, each character being among the GNU Fortran
character set.

<p>For example, if the source file itself has two newlines in a row,
the second newline becomes, after the above translation, a single
line containing 72 spaces.

<h3>Continuation Line</h3>

<p>(Corresponds to Section 3.2.3 of ANSI X3.9-1978 FORTRAN 77.)

<p>A continuation line is any line that both

<ul>
<li>Contains a continuation character, and

<li>Contains only spaces in columns 1 through 5
</ul>

<p>A continuation character is any character of the GNU Fortran character set
other than space (&lt;SPC&gt;) or zero (<code>0</code>)
in column 6, or a digit (<code>0</code> through <code>9</code>) in column
7 through 72 of a line that has only spaces to the left of that
digit.

<p>The continuation character is ignored as far as the content of
the statement is concerned.

<p>The GNU Fortran language places no limit on the number of
continuation lines in a statement. 
In practice, the limit depends on a variety of factors, such as
available memory, statement content, and so on, but no
GNU Fortran system may impose an arbitrary limit.

<br>

<h3>Statements</h3>

<p>(Corresponds to Section 3.3 of ANSI X3.9-1978 FORTRAN 77.)

<p>Statements may be written using an arbitrary number of continuation
lines.

<p>Statements may be separated using the semicolon (<code>;</code>), except
that the logical <code>IF</code> and non-construct <code>WHERE</code> statements
may not be separated from subsequent statements using only a semicolon
as statement separator.

<p>The <code>END PROGRAM</code>, <code>END SUBROUTINE</code>, <code>END FUNCTION</code>,
and <code>END BLOCK DATA</code> statements are alternatives to the <code>END</code>
statement. 
These alternatives may be written as normal statements--they are not
subject to the restrictions of the <code>END</code> statement.

<p>However, no statement other than <code>END</code> may have an initial line
that appears to be an <code>END</code> statement--even <code>END PROGRAM</code>,
for example, must not be written as:

<pre>      END
     &amp;PROGRAM
</pre>

<h3>Statement Labels</h3>

<p>(Corresponds to Section 3.4 of ANSI X3.9-1978 FORTRAN 77.)

<p>A statement separated from its predecessor via a semicolon may be
labeled as follows:

<ul>
<li>The semicolon is followed by the label for the statement,
which in turn follows the label.

<li>The label must be no more than five digits in length.

<li>The first digit of the label for the statement is not
the first non-space character on a line. 
Otherwise, that character is treated as a continuation
character. 
</ul>

<p>A statement may have only one label defined for it.

<br>

<h3>Order of Statements and Lines</h3>

<p>(Corresponds to Section 3.5 of ANSI X3.9-1978 FORTRAN 77.)

<p>Generally, <code>DATA</code> statements may precede executable statements. 
However, specification statements pertaining to any entities
initialized by a <code>DATA</code> statement must precede that <code>DATA</code>
statement. 
For example,
after <code>DATA I/1/</code>, <code>INTEGER I</code> is not permitted, but
<code>INTEGER J</code> is permitted.

<p>The last line of a program unit may be an <code>END</code> statement,
or may be:

<ul>
<li>An <code>END PROGRAM</code> statement, if the program unit is a main program.

<li>An <code>END SUBROUTINE</code> statement, if the program unit is a subroutine.

<li>An <code>END FUNCTION</code> statement, if the program unit is a function.

<li>An <code>END BLOCK DATA</code> statement, if the program unit is a block data. 
</ul>

<h3>Including Source Text</h3>

<p>Additional source text may be included in the processing of
the source file via the <code>INCLUDE</code> directive:

<pre>INCLUDE <var>filename</var>
</pre>

<p>The source text to be included is identified by <var>filename</var>,
which is a literal GNU Fortran character constant. 
The meaning and interpretation of <var>filename</var> depends on the
implementation, but typically is a filename.

<p>(<code>g77</code> treats it as a filename that it searches for
in the current directory and/or directories specified
via the <code>-I</code> command-line option.)

<p>The effect of the <code>INCLUDE</code> directive is as if the
included text directly replaced the directive in the source
file prior to interpretation of the program. 
Included text may itself use <code>INCLUDE</code>. 
The depth of nested <code>INCLUDE</code> references depends on
the implementation, but typically is a positive integer.

<p>This virtual replacement treats the statements and <code>INCLUDE</code>
directives in the included text as syntactically distinct from
those in the including text.

<p>Therefore, the first non-comment line of the included text
must not be a continuation line. 
The included text must therefore have, after the non-comment
lines, either an initial line (statement), an <code>INCLUDE</code>
directive, or nothing (the end of the included text).

<p>Similarly, the including text may end the <code>INCLUDE</code>
directive with a semicolon or the end of the line, but it
cannot follow an <code>INCLUDE</code> directive at the end of its
line with a continuation line. 
Thus, the last statement in an included text may not be
continued.

<p>Any statements between two <code>INCLUDE</code> directives on the
same line are treated as if they appeared in between the
respective included texts. 
For example:

<pre>INCLUDE 'A'; PRINT *, 'B'; INCLUDE 'C'; END PROGRAM
</pre>

<p>If the text included by <code>INCLUDE 'A'</code> constitutes
a <code>PRINT *, 'A'</code> statement and the text included by
<code>INCLUDE 'C'</code> constitutes a <code>PRINT *, 'C'</code> statement,
then the output of the above sample program would be

<pre>A
B
C
</pre>

<p>(with suitable allowances for how an implementation defines
its handling of output).

<p>Included text must not include itself directly or indirectly,
regardless of whether the <var>filename</var> used to reference
the text is the same.

<p>Note that <code>INCLUDE</code> is <em>not</em> a statement. 
As such, it is neither a non-executable or executable
statement. 
However, if the text it includes constitutes one or more
executable statements, then the placement of <code>INCLUDE</code>
is subject to effectively the same restrictions as those
on executable statements.

<p>An <code>INCLUDE</code> directive may be continued across multiple
lines as if it were a statement. 
This permits long names to be used for <var>filename</var>.

<h3>Cpp-style directives</h3>

<p><code>cpp</code> output-style <code>#</code> directives
(see <a href="cpp.html#C%20Preprocessor%20Output">C Preprocessor Output</a>)
are recognized by the compiler even
when the preprocessor isn't run on the input (as it is when compiling
<code>.F</code> files).  (Note the distinction between these <code>cpp</code>
<code>#</code> <em>output</em> directives and <code>#line</code> <em>input</em>
directives.)

<h2>Data Types and Constants</h2>

<p>(The following information augments or overrides the information in
Chapter 4 of ANSI X3.9-1978 FORTRAN 77 in specifying the GNU Fortran
language. 
Chapter 4 of that document otherwise serves as the basis
for the relevant aspects of GNU Fortran.)

<p>To more concisely express the appropriate types for
entities, this document uses the more concise
Fortran 90 nomenclature such as <code>INTEGER(KIND=1)</code>
instead of the more traditional, but less portably concise,
byte-size-based nomenclature such as <code>INTEGER*4</code>,
wherever reasonable.

<p>When referring to generic types--in contexts where the
specific precision and range of a type are not important--this
document uses the generic type names <code>INTEGER</code>, <code>LOGICAL</code>,
<code>REAL</code>, <code>COMPLEX</code>, and <code>CHARACTER</code>.

<p>In some cases, the context requires specification of a
particular type. 
This document uses the <code>KIND=</code> notation to accomplish
this throughout, sometimes supplying the more traditional
notation for clarification, though the traditional notation
might not work the same way on all GNU Fortran implementations.

<p>Use of <code>KIND=</code> makes this document more concise because
<code>g77</code> is able to define values for <code>KIND=</code> that
have the same meanings on all systems, due to the way the
Fortran 90 standard specifies these values are to be used.

<p>(In particular, that standard permits an implementation to
arbitrarily assign nonnegative values. 
There are four distinct sets of assignments: one to the <code>CHARACTER</code>
type; one to the <code>INTEGER</code> type; one to the <code>LOGICAL</code> type;
and the fourth to both the <code>REAL</code> and <code>COMPLEX</code> types. 
Implementations are free to assign these values in any order,
leave gaps in the ordering of assignments, and assign more than
one value to a representation.)

<p>This makes <code>KIND=</code> values superior to the values used
in non-standard statements such as <code>INTEGER*4</code>, because
the meanings of the values in those statements vary from machine
to machine, compiler to compiler, even operating system to
operating system.

<p>However, use of <code>KIND=</code> is <em>not</em> generally recommended
when writing portable code (unless, for example, the code is
going to be compiled only via <code>g77</code>, which is a widely
ported compiler). 
GNU Fortran does not yet have adequate language constructs to
permit use of <code>KIND=</code> in a fashion that would make the
code portable to Fortran 90 implementations; and, this construct
is known to <em>not</em> be accepted by many popular FORTRAN 77
implementations, so it cannot be used in code that is to be ported
to those.

<p>The distinction here is that this document is able to use
specific values for <code>KIND=</code> to concisely document the
types of various operations and operands.

<p>A Fortran program should use the FORTRAN 77 designations for the
appropriate GNU Fortran types--such as <code>INTEGER</code> for
<code>INTEGER(KIND=1)</code>, <code>REAL</code> for <code>REAL(KIND=1)</code>,
and <code>DOUBLE COMPLEX</code> for <code>COMPLEX(KIND=2)</code>--and,
where no such designations exist, make use of appropriate
techniques (preprocessor macros, parameters, and so on)
to specify the types in a fashion that may be easily adjusted
to suit each particular implementation to which the program
is ported. 
(These types generally won't need to be adjusted for ports of
<code>g77</code>.)

<h3>Data Types</h3>

<p>(Corresponds to Section 4.1 of ANSI X3.9-1978 FORTRAN 77.)

<p>GNU Fortran supports these types:

<ol type=1 start=1>
</p><li>Integer (generic type <code>INTEGER</code>)

<li>Real (generic type <code>REAL</code>)

<li>Double precision

<li>Complex (generic type <code>COMPLEX</code>)

<li>Logical (generic type <code>LOGICAL</code>)

<li>Character (generic type <code>CHARACTER</code>)

<li>Double Complex
</ol>

<p>(The types numbered 1 through 6 above are standard FORTRAN 77 types.)

<p>The generic types shown above are referred to in this document
using only their generic type names. 
Such references usually indicate that any specific type (kind)
of that generic type is valid.

<p>For example, a context described in this document as accepting
the <code>COMPLEX</code> type also is likely to accept the
<code>DOUBLE COMPLEX</code> type.

<p>The GNU Fortran language supports three ways to specify
a specific kind of a generic type.

<ul>
<li><a href="#Double%20Notation">Double Notation</a>:   As in <code>DOUBLE COMPLEX</code>. 
<li><a href="#Star%20Notation">Star Notation</a>:     As in <code>INTEGER*4</code>. 
<li><a href="#Kind%20Notation">Kind Notation</a>:     As in <code>INTEGER(KIND=1)</code>. 
</ul>

<br>

<h4>Double Notation</h4>

<p>The GNU Fortran language supports two uses of the keyword
<code>DOUBLE</code> to specify a specific kind of type:

<ul>
<li><code>DOUBLE PRECISION</code>, equivalent to <code>REAL(KIND=2)</code>

<li><code>DOUBLE COMPLEX</code>, equivalent to <code>COMPLEX(KIND=2)</code>
</ul>

<p>Use one of the above forms where a type name is valid.

<p>While use of this notation is popular, it doesn't scale
well in a language or dialect rich in intrinsic types,
as is the case for the GNU Fortran language (especially
planned future versions of it).

<p>After all, one rarely sees type names such as <code>DOUBLE INTEGER</code>,
<code>QUADRUPLE REAL</code>, or <code>QUARTER INTEGER</code>. 
Instead, <code>INTEGER*8</code>, <code>REAL*16</code>, and <code>INTEGER*1</code>
often are substituted for these, respectively, even though they
do not always have the same meanings on all systems. 
(And, the fact that <code>DOUBLE REAL</code> does not exist as such
is an inconsistency.)

<p>Therefore, this document uses "double notation" only on occasion
for the benefit of those readers who are accustomed to it.

<br>

<h4>Star Notation</h4>

<p>The following notation specifies the storage size for a type:

<pre><var>generic-type</var>*<var>n</var>
</pre>

<p><var>generic-type</var> must be a generic type--one of
<code>INTEGER</code>, <code>REAL</code>, <code>COMPLEX</code>, <code>LOGICAL</code>,
or <code>CHARACTER</code>. 
<var>n</var> must be one or more digits comprising a decimal
integer number greater than zero.

<p>Use the above form where a type name is valid.

<p>The <code>*<var>n</var></code> notation specifies that the amount of storage
occupied by variables and array elements of that type is <var>n</var>
times the storage occupied by a <code>CHARACTER*1</code> variable.

<p>This notation might indicate a different degree of precision and/or
range for such variables and array elements, and the functions that
return values of types using this notation. 
It does not limit the precision or range of values of that type
in any particular way--use explicit code to do that.

<p>Further, the GNU Fortran language requires no particular values
for <var>n</var> to be supported by an implementation via the <code>*<var>n</var></code>
notation. 
<code>g77</code> supports <code>INTEGER*1</code> (as <code>INTEGER(KIND=3)</code>)
on all systems, for example,
but not all implementations are required to do so, and <code>g77</code>
is known to not support <code>REAL*1</code> on most (or all) systems.

<p>As a result, except for <var>generic-type</var> of <code>CHARACTER</code>,
uses of this notation should be limited to isolated
portions of a program that are intended to handle system-specific
tasks and are expected to be non-portable.

<p>(Standard FORTRAN 77 supports the <code>*<var>n</var></code> notation for
only <code>CHARACTER</code>, where it signifies not only the amount
of storage occupied, but the number of characters in entities
of that type. 
However, almost all Fortran compilers have supported this
notation for generic types, though with a variety of meanings
for <var>n</var>.)

<p>Specifications of types using the <code>*<var>n</var></code> notation
always are interpreted as specifications of the appropriate
types described in this document using the <code>KIND=<var>n</var></code>
notation, described below.

<p>While use of this notation is popular, it doesn't serve well
in the context of a widely portable dialect of Fortran, such as
the GNU Fortran language.

<p>For example, even on one particular machine, two or more popular
Fortran compilers might well disagree on the size of a type
declared <code>INTEGER*2</code> or <code>REAL*16</code>. 
Certainly there
is known to be disagreement over such things among Fortran
compilers on <em>different</em> systems.

<p>Further, this notation offers no elegant way to specify sizes
that are not even multiples of the "byte size" typically
designated by <code>INTEGER*1</code>. 
Use of "absurd" values (such as <code>INTEGER*1000</code>) would
certainly be possible, but would perhaps be stretching the original
intent of this notation beyond the breaking point in terms
of widespread readability of documentation and code making use
of it.

<p>Therefore, this document uses "star notation" only on occasion
for the benefit of those readers who are accustomed to it.

<br>

<h4>Kind Notation</h4>

<p>The following notation specifies the kind-type selector of a type:

<pre><var>generic-type</var>(KIND=<var>n</var>)
</pre>

<p>Use the above form where a type name is valid.

<p><var>generic-type</var> must be a generic type--one of
<code>INTEGER</code>, <code>REAL</code>, <code>COMPLEX</code>, <code>LOGICAL</code>,
or <code>CHARACTER</code>. 
<var>n</var> must be an integer initialization expression that
is a positive, nonzero value.

<p>Programmers are discouraged from writing these values directly
into their code. 
Future versions of the GNU Fortran language will offer
facilities that will make the writing of code portable
to <code>g77</code> <em>and</em> Fortran 90 implementations simpler.

<p>However, writing code that ports to existing FORTRAN 77
implementations depends on avoiding the <code>KIND=</code> construct.

<p>The <code>KIND=</code> construct is thus useful in the context
of GNU Fortran for two reasons:

<ul>
<li>It provides a means to specify a type in a fashion that
is portable across all GNU Fortran implementations (though
not other FORTRAN 77 and Fortran 90 implementations).

<li>It provides a sort of Rosetta stone for this document to use
to concisely describe the types of various operations and
operands. 
</ul>

<p>The values of <var>n</var> in the GNU Fortran language are
assigned using a scheme that:

<ul>
<li>Attempts to maximize the ability of readers
of this document to quickly familiarize themselves
with assignments for popular types

<li>Provides a unique value for each specific desired
meaning

<li>Provides a means to automatically assign new values so
they have a "natural" relationship to existing values,
if appropriate, or, if no such relationship exists, will
not interfere with future values assigned on the basis
of such relationships

<li>Avoids using values that are similar to values used
in the existing, popular <code>*<var>n</var></code> notation,
to prevent readers from expecting that these implied
correspondences work on all GNU Fortran implementations
</ul>

<p>The assignment system accomplishes this by assigning
to each "fundamental meaning" of a specific type a
unique prime number. 
Combinations of fundamental meanings--for example, a type
that is two times the size of some other type--are assigned
values of <var>n</var> that are the products of the values for
those fundamental meanings.

<p>A prime value of <var>n</var> is never given more than one fundamental
meaning, to avoid situations where some code or system
cannot reasonably provide those meanings in the form of a
single type.

<p>The values of <var>n</var> assigned so far are:

<dl>
<dt><code>KIND=0</code>
<dd>This value is reserved for future use.

<p>The planned future use is for this value to designate,
explicitly, context-sensitive kind-type selection. 
For example, the expression <code>1D0 * 0.1_0</code> would
be equivalent to <code>1D0 * 0.1D0</code>.

<br><dt><code>KIND=1</code>
<dd>This corresponds to the default types for
<code>REAL</code>, <code>INTEGER</code>, <code>LOGICAL</code>, <code>COMPLEX</code>,
and <code>CHARACTER</code>, as appropriate.

<p>These are the "default" types described in the Fortran 90 standard,
though that standard does not assign any particular <code>KIND=</code>
value to these types.

<p>(Typically, these are <code>REAL*4</code>, <code>INTEGER*4</code>,
<code>LOGICAL*4</code>, and <code>COMPLEX*8</code>.)

<br><dt><code>KIND=2</code>
<dd>This corresponds to types that occupy twice as much
storage as the default types. 
<code>REAL(KIND=2)</code> is <code>DOUBLE PRECISION</code> (typically <code>REAL*8</code>),
<code>COMPLEX(KIND=2)</code> is <code>DOUBLE COMPLEX</code> (typically <code>COMPLEX*16</code>),

<p>These are the "double precision" types described in the Fortran 90
standard,
though that standard does not assign any particular <code>KIND=</code>
value to these types.

<p><var>n</var> of 4 thus corresponds to types that occupy four times
as much storage as the default types, <var>n</var> of 8 to types that
occupy eight times as much storage, and so on.

<p>The <code>INTEGER(KIND=2)</code> and <code>LOGICAL(KIND=2)</code> types
are not necessarily supported by every GNU Fortran implementation.

<br><dt><code>KIND=3</code>
<dd>This corresponds to types that occupy as much
storage as the default <code>CHARACTER</code> type,
which is the same effective type as <code>CHARACTER(KIND=1)</code>
(making that type effectively the same as <code>CHARACTER(KIND=3)</code>).

<p>(Typically, these are <code>INTEGER*1</code> and <code>LOGICAL*1</code>.)

<p><var>n</var> of 6 thus corresponds to types that occupy twice as
much storage as the <var>n</var>=3 types, <var>n</var> of 12 to types
that occupy four times as much storage, and so on.

<p>These are not necessarily supported by every GNU Fortran
implementation.

<br><dt><code>KIND=5</code>
<dd>This corresponds to types that occupy half the
storage as the default (<var>n</var>=1) types.

<p>(Typically, these are <code>INTEGER*2</code> and <code>LOGICAL*2</code>.)

<p><var>n</var> of 25 thus corresponds to types that occupy one-quarter
as much storage as the default types.

<p>These are not necessarily supported by every GNU Fortran
implementation.

<br><dt><code>KIND=7</code>
<dd>This is valid only as <code>INTEGER(KIND=7)</code> and
denotes the <code>INTEGER</code> type that has the smallest
storage size that holds a pointer on the system.

<p>A pointer representable by this type is capable of uniquely
addressing a <code>CHARACTER*1</code> variable, array, array element,
or substring.

<p>(Typically this is equivalent to <code>INTEGER*4</code> or,
on 64-bit systems, <code>INTEGER*8</code>. 
In a compatible C implementation, it typically would
be the same size and semantics of the C type <code>void *</code>.) 
</dl>

<p>Note that these are <em>proposed</em> correspondences and might change
in future versions of <code>g77</code>--avoid writing code depending
on them while <code>g77</code>, and therefore the GNU Fortran language
it defines, is in beta testing.

<p>Values not specified in the above list are reserved to
future versions of the GNU Fortran language.

<p>Implementation-dependent meanings will be assigned new,
unique prime numbers so as to not interfere with other
implementation-dependent meanings, and offer the possibility
of increasing the portability of code depending on such
types by offering support for them in other GNU Fortran
implementations.

<p>Other meanings that might be given unique values are:

<ul>
<li>Types that make use of only half their storage size for
representing precision and range.

<p>For example, some compilers offer options that cause
<code>INTEGER</code> types to occupy the amount of storage
that would be needed for <code>INTEGER(KIND=2)</code> types, but the
range remains that of <code>INTEGER(KIND=1)</code>.

</p><li>The IEEE single floating-point type.

<li>Types with a specific bit pattern (endianness), such as the
little-endian form of <code>INTEGER(KIND=1)</code>. 
These could permit, conceptually, use of portable code and
implementations on data files written by existing systems. 
</ul>

<p>Future <em>prime</em> numbers should be given meanings in as incremental
a fashion as possible, to allow for flexibility and
expressiveness in combining types.

<p>For example, instead of defining a prime number for little-endian
IEEE doubles, one prime number might be assigned the meaning
"little-endian", another the meaning "IEEE double", and the
value of <var>n</var> for a little-endian IEEE double would thus
naturally be the product of those two respective assigned values. 
(It could even be reasonable to have IEEE values result from the
products of prime values denoting exponent and fraction sizes
and meanings, hidden bit usage, availability and representations
of special values such as subnormals, infinities, and Not-A-Numbers
(NaNs), and so on.)

<p>This assignment mechanism, while not inherently required for
future versions of the GNU Fortran language, is worth using
because it could ease management of the "space" of supported
types much easier in the long run.

<p>The above approach suggests a mechanism for specifying inheritance
of intrinsic (built-in) types for an entire, widely portable
product line. 
It is certainly reasonable that, unlike programmers of other languages
offering inheritance mechanisms that employ verbose names for classes
and subclasses, along with graphical browsers to elucidate the
relationships, Fortran programmers would employ
a mechanism that works by multiplying prime numbers together
and finding the prime factors of such products.

<p>Most of the advantages for the above scheme have been explained
above. 
One disadvantage is that it could lead to the defining,
by the GNU Fortran language, of some fairly large prime numbers. 
This could lead to the GNU Fortran language being declared
"munitions" by the United States Department of Defense.

<h3>Constants</h3>

<p>(Corresponds to Section 4.2 of ANSI X3.9-1978 FORTRAN 77.)

<p>A <dfn>typeless constant</dfn> has one of the following forms:

<pre>'<var>binary-digits</var>'B
'<var>octal-digits</var>'O
'<var>hexadecimal-digits</var>'Z
'<var>hexadecimal-digits</var>'X
</pre>

<p><var>binary-digits</var>, <var>octal-digits</var>, and <var>hexadecimal-digits</var>
are nonempty strings of characters in the set <code>01</code>, <code>01234567</code>,
and <code>0123456789ABCDEFabcdef</code>, respectively. 
(The value for <code>A</code> (and <code>a</code>) is 10, for <code>B</code> and <code>b</code>
is 11, and so on.)

<p>A prefix-radix constant, such as <code>Z'ABCD'</code>, can optionally be
treated as typeless.  See <a href="#Fortran%20Dialect%20Options">Options Controlling Fortran Dialect</a>, for information on the
<code>-ftypeless-boz</code> option.

<p>Typeless constants have values that depend on the context in which
they are used.

<p>All other constants, called <dfn>typed constants</dfn>, are interpreted--converted
to internal form--according to their inherent type. 
Thus, context is <em>never</em> a determining factor for the type, and hence
the interpretation, of a typed constant. 
(All constants in the ANSI FORTRAN 77 language are typed constants.)

<p>For example, <code>1</code> is always type <code>INTEGER(KIND=1)</code> in GNU
Fortran (called default INTEGER in Fortran 90),
<code>9.435784839284958</code> is always type <code>REAL(KIND=1)</code> (even if the
additional precision specified is lost, and even when used in a
<code>REAL(KIND=2)</code> context), <code>1E0</code> is always type <code>REAL(KIND=2)</code>,
and <code>1D0</code> is always type <code>REAL(KIND=2)</code>.

<h3>Integer Type</h3>

<p>(Corresponds to Section 4.3 of ANSI X3.9-1978 FORTRAN 77.)

<p>An integer constant also may have one of the following forms:

<pre>B'<var>binary-digits</var>'
O'<var>octal-digits</var>'
Z'<var>hexadecimal-digits</var>'
X'<var>hexadecimal-digits</var>'
</pre>

<p><var>binary-digits</var>, <var>octal-digits</var>, and <var>hexadecimal-digits</var>
are nonempty strings of characters in the set <code>01</code>, <code>01234567</code>,
and <code>0123456789ABCDEFabcdef</code>, respectively. 
(The value for <code>A</code> (and <code>a</code>) is 10, for <code>B</code> and <code>b</code>
is 11, and so on.)

<br>

<h3>Character Type</h3>

<p>(Corresponds to Section 4.8 of ANSI X3.9-1978 FORTRAN 77.)

<p>A character constant may be delimited by a pair of double quotes
(<code>"</code>) instead of apostrophes. 
In this case, an apostrophe within the constant represents
a single apostrophe, while a double quote is represented in
the source text of the constant by two consecutive double
quotes with no intervening spaces.

<p>A character constant may be empty (have a length of zero).

<p>A character constant may include a substring specification,
The value of such a constant is the value of the substring--for
example, the value of <code>'hello'(3:5)</code> is the same
as the value of <code>'llo'</code>.

<h3>The <code>%LOC()</code> Construct</h3>

<pre>%LOC(<var>arg</var>)
</pre>

<p>The <code>%LOC()</code> construct is an expression
that yields the value of the location of its argument,
<var>arg</var>, in memory. 
The size of the type of the expression depends on the system--typically,
it is equivalent to either <code>INTEGER(KIND=1)</code> or <code>INTEGER(KIND=2)</code>,
though it is actually type <code>INTEGER(KIND=7)</code>.

<p>The argument to <code>%LOC()</code> must be suitable as the
left-hand side of an assignment statement. 
That is, it may not be a general expression involving
operators such as addition, subtraction, and so on,
nor may it be a constant.

<p>Use of <code>%LOC()</code> is recommended only for code that
is accessing facilities outside of GNU Fortran, such as
operating system or windowing facilities. 
It is best to constrain such uses to isolated portions of
a program--portions that deal specifically and exclusively
with low-level, system-dependent facilities. 
Such portions might well provide a portable interface for
use by the program as a whole, but are themselves not
portable, and should be thoroughly tested each time they
are rebuilt using a new compiler or version of a compiler.

<p>Do not depend on <code>%LOC()</code> returning a pointer that
can be safely used to <em>define</em> (change) the argument. 
While this might work in some circumstances, it is hard
to predict whether it will continue to work when a program
(that works using this unsafe behavior)
is recompiled using different command-line options or
a different version of <code>g77</code>.

<p>Generally, <code>%LOC()</code> is safe when used as an argument
to a procedure that makes use of the value of the corresponding
dummy argument only during its activation, and only when
such use is restricted to referencing (reading) the value
of the argument to <code>%LOC()</code>.

<p><em>Implementation Note:</em> Currently, <code>g77</code> passes
arguments (those not passed using a construct such as <code>%VAL()</code>)
by reference or descriptor, depending on the type of
the actual argument. 
Thus, given <code>INTEGER I</code>, <code>CALL FOO(I)</code> would
seem to mean the same thing as <code>CALL FOO(%VAL(%LOC(I)))</code>, and
in fact might compile to identical code.

<p>However, <code>CALL FOO(%VAL(%LOC(I)))</code> emphatically means
"pass, by value, the address of <code>I</code> in memory". 
While <code>CALL FOO(I)</code> might use that same approach in a
particular version of <code>g77</code>, another version or compiler
might choose a different implementation, such as copy-in/copy-out,
to effect the desired behavior--and which will therefore not
necessarily compile to the same code as would
<code>CALL FOO(%VAL(%LOC(I)))</code>
using the same version or compiler.

<p>See <a href="#Debugging%20and%20Interfacing">Debugging and Interfacing</a>, for detailed information on
how this particular version of <code>g77</code> implements various
constructs.

<h3><code>NAMELIST</code> Statement</h3>

<p>The <code>NAMELIST</code> statement, and related I/O constructs, are
supported by the GNU Fortran language in essentially the same
way as they are by <code>f2c</code>.

<p>This follows Fortran 90 with the restriction that on <code>NAMELIST</code>
input, subscripts must have the form
<pre><var>subscript</var> [ <code>:</code> <var>subscript</var> [ <code>:</code> <var>stride</var>]]
</pre>
i.e.
<pre>&amp;xx x(1:3,8:10:2)=1,2,3,4,5,6/
</pre>
is allowed, but not, say,
<pre>&amp;xx x(:3,8::2)=1,2,3,4,5,6/
</pre>

<p>As an extension of the Fortran 90 form, <code>$</code> and <code>$END</code> may be
used in place of <code>&amp;</code> and <code>/</code> in <code>NAMELIST</code> input, so that
<pre>$&amp;xx x(1:3,8:10:2)=1,2,3,4,5,6 $end
</pre>
could be used instead of the example above.

<h3>DO WHILE</h3>

<p>The <code>DO WHILE</code> statement, a feature of both the MIL-STD 1753 and

also supported.

<h3>END DO</h3>

<p>The <code>END DO</code> statement is provided by the GNU Fortran language.

<p>This statement is used in one of two ways:

<ul>
<li>The Fortran 90 meaning, in which it specifies the termination
point of a single <code>DO</code> loop started with a <code>DO</code> statement
that specifies no termination label.

<li>The MIL-STD 1753 meaning, in which it specifies the termination
point of one or more <code>DO</code> loops, all of which start with a
<code>DO</code> statement that specify the label defined for the
<code>END DO</code> statement.

<p>This kind of <code>END DO</code> statement is merely a synonym for
<code>CONTINUE</code>, except it is permitted only when the statement
is labeled and a target of one or more labeled <code>DO</code> loops.

<p>It is expected that this use of <code>END DO</code> will be removed from
the GNU Fortran language in the future, though it is likely that
it will long be supported by <code>g77</code> as a dialect form.

<h3>Construct Names</h3>

<p>The GNU Fortran language supports construct names as defined
by the Fortran 90 standard. 
These names are local to the program unit and are defined
as follows:

<pre><var>construct-name</var>: <var>block-statement</var>
</pre>

<p>Here, <var>construct-name</var> is the construct name itself;
its definition is connoted by the single colon (<code>:</code>); and
<var>block-statement</var> is an <code>IF</code>, <code>DO</code>,
or <code>SELECT CASE</code> statement that begins a block.

<p>A block that is given a construct name must also specify the
same construct name in its termination statement:

<pre>END <var>block</var> <var>construct-name</var>
</pre>

<p>Here, <var>block</var> must be <code>IF</code>, <code>DO</code>, or <code>SELECT</code>,
as appropriate.

<br>

<h3>The <code>CYCLE</code> and <code>EXIT</code> Statements</h3>

<p>The <code>CYCLE</code> and <code>EXIT</code> statements specify that
the remaining statements in the current iteration of a
particular active (enclosing) <code>DO</code> loop are to be skipped.

<p><code>CYCLE</code> specifies that these statements are skipped,
but the <code>END DO</code> statement that marks the end of the
<code>DO</code> loop be executed--that is, the next iteration,
if any, is to be started. 
If the statement marking the end of the <code>DO</code> loop is
not <code>END DO</code>--in other words, if the loop is not
a block <code>DO</code>--the <code>CYCLE</code> statement does not
execute that statement, but does start the next iteration (if any).

<p><code>EXIT</code> specifies that the loop specified by the
<code>DO</code> construct is terminated.

<p>The <code>DO</code> loop affected by <code>CYCLE</code> and <code>EXIT</code>
is the innermost enclosing <code>DO</code> loop when the following
forms are used:

<pre>CYCLE
EXIT
</pre>

<p>Otherwise, the following forms specify the construct name
of the pertinent <code>DO</code> loop:

<pre>CYCLE <var>construct-name</var>
EXIT <var>construct-name</var>
</pre>

<p><code>CYCLE</code> and <code>EXIT</code> can be viewed as glorified <code>GO TO</code>
statements. 
However, they cannot be easily thought of as <code>GO TO</code> statements
in obscure cases involving FORTRAN 77 loops. 
For example:

<pre>      DO 10 I = 1, 5
      DO 10 J = 1, 5
         IF (J .EQ. 5) EXIT
      DO 10 K = 1, 5
         IF (K .EQ. 3) CYCLE
10    PRINT *, 'I=', I, ' J=', J, ' K=', K
20    CONTINUE
</pre>

<p>In particular, neither the <code>EXIT</code> nor <code>CYCLE</code> statements
above are equivalent to a <code>GO TO</code> statement to either label
<code>10</code> or <code>20</code>.

<p>To understand the effect of <code>CYCLE</code> and <code>EXIT</code> in the
above fragment, it is helpful to first translate it to its equivalent
using only block <code>DO</code> loops:

<pre>      DO I = 1, 5
         DO J = 1, 5
            IF (J .EQ. 5) EXIT
            DO K = 1, 5
               IF (K .EQ. 3) CYCLE
10             PRINT *, 'I=', I, ' J=', J, ' K=', K
            END DO
         END DO
      END DO
20    CONTINUE
</pre>

<p>Adding new labels allows translation of <code>CYCLE</code> and <code>EXIT</code>
to <code>GO TO</code> so they may be more easily understood by programmers
accustomed to FORTRAN coding:

<pre>      DO I = 1, 5
         DO J = 1, 5
            IF (J .EQ. 5) GOTO 18
            DO K = 1, 5
               IF (K .EQ. 3) GO TO 12
10             PRINT *, 'I=', I, ' J=', J, ' K=', K
12          END DO
         END DO
18    END DO
20    CONTINUE
</pre>

<p>Thus, the <code>CYCLE</code> statement in the innermost loop skips over
the <code>PRINT</code> statement as it begins the next iteration of the
loop, while the <code>EXIT</code> statement in the middle loop ends that
loop but <em>not</em> the outermost loop.

<h3>The <code>%VAL()</code> Construct</h3>

<pre>%VAL(<var>arg</var>)
</pre>

<p>The <code>%VAL()</code> construct specifies that an argument,
<var>arg</var>, is to be passed by value, instead of by reference
or descriptor.

<p><code>%VAL()</code> is restricted to actual arguments in
invocations of external procedures.

<p>Use of <code>%VAL()</code> is recommended only for code that
is accessing facilities outside of GNU Fortran, such as
operating system or windowing facilities. 
It is best to constrain such uses to isolated portions of
a program--portions the deal specifically and exclusively
with low-level, system-dependent facilities. 
Such portions might well provide a portable interface for
use by the program as a whole, but are themselves not
portable, and should be thoroughly tested each time they
are rebuilt using a new compiler or version of a compiler.

<p><em>Implementation Note:</em> Currently, <code>g77</code> passes
all arguments either by reference or by descriptor.

<p>Thus, use of <code>%VAL()</code> tends to be restricted to cases
where the called procedure is written in a language other
than Fortran that supports call-by-value semantics. 
(C is an example of such a language.)

<h3>The <code>%REF()</code> Construct</h3>

<pre>%REF(<var>arg</var>)
</pre>

<p>The <code>%REF()</code> construct specifies that an argument,
<var>arg</var>, is to be passed by reference, instead of by
value or descriptor.

<p><code>%REF()</code> is restricted to actual arguments in
invocations of external procedures.

<p>Use of <code>%REF()</code> is recommended only for code that

are rebuilt using a new compiler or version of a compiler.

<p>Do not depend on <code>%REF()</code> supplying a pointer to the
procedure being invoked. 
While that is a likely implementation choice, other
implementation choices are available that preserve Fortran
pass-by-reference semantics without passing a pointer to
the argument, <var>arg</var>. 
(For example, a copy-in/copy-out implementation.)

<p><em>Implementation Note:</em> Currently, <code>g77</code> passes
all arguments
(other than variables and arrays of type <code>CHARACTER</code>)
by reference. 
Future versions of, or dialects supported by, <code>g77</code> might
not pass <code>CHARACTER</code> functions by reference.

<p>Thus, use of <code>%REF()</code> tends to be restricted to cases
where <var>arg</var> is type <code>CHARACTER</code> but the called
procedure accesses it via a means other than the method
used for Fortran <code>CHARACTER</code> arguments.

<p>See <a href="#Procedures">Procedures (SUBROUTINE and FUNCTION)</a>, for detailed information on

<h3>The <code>%DESCR()</code> Construct</h3>

<pre>%DESCR(<var>arg</var>)
</pre>

<p>The <code>%DESCR()</code> construct specifies that an argument,
<var>arg</var>, is to be passed by descriptor, instead of by
value or reference.

<p><code>%DESCR()</code> is restricted to actual arguments in
invocations of external procedures.

<p>Use of <code>%DESCR()</code> is recommended only for code that
is accessing facilities outside of GNU Fortran, such as

and/or a length passed by value
to the procedure being invoked. 
While that is a likely implementation choice, other
implementation choices are available that preserve the
pass-by-reference semantics without passing a pointer to
the argument, <var>arg</var>. 
(For example, a copy-in/copy-out implementation.) 
And, future versions of <code>g77</code> might change the
way descriptors are implemented, such as passing a
single argument pointing to a record containing the
pointer/length information instead of passing that same
information via two arguments as it currently does.

<p><em>Implementation Note:</em> Currently, <code>g77</code> passes
all variables and arrays of type <code>CHARACTER</code>
by descriptor. 
Future versions of, or dialects supported by, <code>g77</code> might
pass <code>CHARACTER</code> functions by descriptor as well.

<p>Thus, use of <code>%DESCR()</code> tends to be restricted to cases

<h3>Generics and Specifics</h3>

<p>The ANSI FORTRAN 77 language defines generic and specific
intrinsics. 
In short, the distinctions are:

<ul>
<li><em>Specific</em> intrinsics have
specific types for their arguments and a specific return
type.

<li><em>Generic</em> intrinsics are treated,
on a case-by-case basis in the program's source code,
as one of several possible specific intrinsics.

<p>Typically, a generic intrinsic has a return type that
is determined by the type of one or more of its arguments. 
</ul>

<p>The GNU Fortran language generalizes these concepts somewhat,
especially by providing intrinsic subroutines and generic
intrinsics that are treated as either a specific intrinsic subroutine
or a specific intrinsic function (e.g. <code>SECOND</code>).

<p>However, GNU Fortran avoids generalizing this concept to
the point where existing code would be accepted as meaning
something possibly different than what was intended.

<p>For example, <code>ABS</code> is a generic intrinsic, so all working
code written using <code>ABS</code> of an <code>INTEGER</code> argument
expects an <code>INTEGER</code> return value. 
Similarly, all such code expects that <code>ABS</code> of an <code>INTEGER*2</code>
argument returns an <code>INTEGER*2</code> return value.

<p>Yet, <code>IABS</code> is a <em>specific</em> intrinsic that accepts only
an <code>INTEGER(KIND=1)</code> argument. 
Code that passes something other than an <code>INTEGER(KIND=1)</code>
argument to <code>IABS</code> is not valid GNU Fortran code, because
it is not clear what the author intended.

<p>For example, if <code>J</code> is <code>INTEGER(KIND=6)</code>, <code>IABS(J)</code>
is not defined by the GNU Fortran language, because the programmer
might have used that construct to mean any of the following, subtly
different, things:

<ul>
<li>Convert <code>J</code> to <code>INTEGER(KIND=1)</code> first
(as if <code>IABS(INT(J))</code> had been written).

<li>Convert the result of the intrinsic to <code>INTEGER(KIND=1)</code>
(as if <code>INT(ABS(J))</code> had been written).

<li>No conversion (as if <code>ABS(J)</code> had been written). 
</ul>

<p>The distinctions matter especially when types and values wider than
<code>INTEGER(KIND=1)</code> (such as <code>INTEGER(KIND=2)</code>), or when
operations performing more "arithmetic" than absolute-value, are involved.

<p>The following sample program is not a valid GNU Fortran program, but
might be accepted by other compilers. 
If so, the output is likely to be revealing in terms of how a given
compiler treats intrinsics (that normally are specific) when they
are given arguments that do not conform to their stated requirements:

</pre>

<p>No future version of the GNU Fortran language
will likely permit specific intrinsic invocations with wrong-typed
arguments (such as <code>IDIM</code> in the above example), since
it has been determined that disagreements exist among
many production compilers on the interpretation of
such invocations. 
These disagreements strongly suggest that Fortran programmers,
and certainly existing Fortran programs, disagree about the
meaning of such invocations.

<p>The first version of <code>JCB002</code> didn't accommodate some compilers'
treatment of <code>INT(I1-I2)</code> where <code>I1</code> and <code>I2</code> are
<code>INTEGER*2</code>. 
In such a case, these compilers apparently convert both
operands to <code>INTEGER*4</code> and then do an <code>INTEGER*4</code> subtraction,
instead of doing an <code>INTEGER*2</code> subtraction on the
original values in <code>I1</code> and <code>I2</code>.

<p>However, the results of the careful analyses done on the outputs
of programs compiled by these various compilers show that they
all implement either <code>Interp 1</code> or <code>Interp 2</code> above.

<p>Specifically, it is believed that the new version of <code>JCB002</code>
above will confirm that:

<ul>
<li>Digital Semiconductor ("DEC") Alpha OSF/1, HP-UX 10.0.1, AIX 3.2.5
<code>f77</code> compilers all implement <code>Interp 1</code>.

<li>IRIX 5.3 <code>f77</code> compiler implements <code>Interp 2</code>.

<li>Solaris 2.5, SunOS 4.1.3, DECstation ULTRIX 4.3,
and IRIX 6.1 <code>f77</code> compilers all implement <code>Interp 3</code>. 
</ul>

<p>If you get different results than the above for the stated
compilers, or have results for other compilers that might be
worth adding to the above list, please let us know the details
(compiler product, version, machine, results, and so on).

<h3><code>REAL()</code> and <code>AIMAG()</code> of Complex</h3>

<p>The GNU Fortran language disallows <code>REAL(<var>expr</var>)</code>
and <code>AIMAG(<var>expr</var>)</code>,
where <var>expr</var> is any <code>COMPLEX</code> type other than <code>COMPLEX(KIND=1)</code>,
except when they are used in the following way:

<pre>REAL(REAL(<var>expr</var>))
REAL(AIMAG(<var>expr</var>))
</pre>

<p>The above forms explicitly specify that the desired effect
is to convert the real or imaginary part of <var>expr</var>, which might
be some <code>REAL</code> type other than <code>REAL(KIND=1)</code>,
to type <code>REAL(KIND=1)</code>,
and have that serve as the value of the expression.

<p>The GNU Fortran language offers clearly named intrinsics to extract the
real and imaginary parts of a complex entity without any
conversion:

<pre>REALPART(<var>expr</var>)
IMAGPART(<var>expr</var>)
</pre>

<p>To express the above using typical extended FORTRAN 77,
use the following constructs
(when <var>expr</var> is <code>COMPLEX(KIND=2)</code>):

<pre>DBLE(<var>expr</var>)
DIMAG(<var>expr</var>)
</pre>

<p>The FORTRAN 77 language offers no way
to explicitly specify the real and imaginary parts of a complex expression of
arbitrary type, apparently as a result of requiring support for
only one <code>COMPLEX</code> type (<code>COMPLEX(KIND=1)</code>). 
The concepts of converting an expression to type <code>REAL(KIND=1)</code> and
of extracting the real part of a complex expression were
thus "smooshed" by FORTRAN 77 into a single intrinsic, since
they happened to have the exact same effect in that language
(due to having only one <code>COMPLEX</code> type).

<p><em>Note:</em> When <code>-ff90</code> is in effect,
<code>g77</code> treats <code>REAL(<var>expr</var>)</code>, where <var>expr</var> is of
type <code>COMPLEX</code>, as <code>REALPART(<var>expr</var>)</code>,
whereas with <code>-fugly-complex -fno-f90</code> in effect, it is
treated as <code>REAL(REALPART(<var>expr</var>))</code>.

<h3><code>CMPLX()</code> of <code>DOUBLE PRECISION</code></h3>

<p>In accordance with Fortran 90 and at least some (perhaps all)
other compilers, the GNU Fortran language defines <code>CMPLX()</code>
as always returning a result that is type <code>COMPLEX(KIND=1)</code>.

<p>This means <code>CMPLX(D1,D2)</code>, where <code>D1</code> and <code>D2</code>
are <code>REAL(KIND=2)</code> (<code>DOUBLE PRECISION</code>), is treated as:

<pre>CMPLX(SNGL(D1), SNGL(D2))
</pre>

<p>(It was necessary for Fortran 90 to specify this behavior
for <code>DOUBLE PRECISION</code> arguments, since that is
the behavior mandated by FORTRAN 77.)

<p>The GNU Fortran language also provides the <code>DCMPLX()</code> intrinsic,
which is provided by some FORTRAN 77 compilers to construct
a <code>DOUBLE COMPLEX</code> entity from of <code>DOUBLE PRECISION</code>
operands. 
However, this solution does not scale well when more <code>COMPLEX</code> types
(having various precisions and ranges) are offered by Fortran implementations.

<p>Fortran 90 extends the <code>CMPLX()</code> intrinsic by adding
an extra argument used to specify the desired kind of complex
result. 
However, this solution is somewhat awkward to use, and
<code>g77</code> currently does not support it.

<p>The GNU Fortran language provides a simple way to build a complex
value out of two numbers, with the precise type of the value
determined by the types of the two numbers (via the usual
type-promotion mechanism):

<pre>COMPLEX(<var>real</var>, <var>imag</var>)
</pre>

<p>When <var>real</var> and <var>imag</var> are the same <code>REAL</code> types, <code>COMPLEX()</code>
performs no conversion other than to put them together to form a
complex result of the same (complex version of real) type.

<p>See <a href="#Complex%20Intrinsic">Complex Intrinsic</a>, for more information.

<h3>Table of Intrinsic Functions</h3>

<p>(Corresponds to Section 15.10 of ANSI X3.9-1978 FORTRAN 77.)

<p>The GNU Fortran language adds various functions, subroutines, types,
and arguments to the set of intrinsic functions in ANSI FORTRAN 77. 
The complete set of intrinsics supported by the GNU Fortran language
is described below.

<p>Note that a name is not treated as that of an intrinsic if it is
specified in an <code>EXTERNAL</code> statement in the same program unit;
if a command-line option is used to disable the groups to which
the intrinsic belongs; or if the intrinsic is not named in an
<code>INTRINSIC</code> statement and a command-line option is used to
hide the groups to which the intrinsic belongs.

<p>So, it is recommended that any reference in a program unit to
an intrinsic procedure that is not a standard FORTRAN 77
intrinsic be accompanied by an appropriate <code>INTRINSIC</code>
statement in that program unit. 
This sort of defensive programming makes it more
likely that an implementation will issue a diagnostic rather
than generate incorrect code for such a reference.

<p>The terminology used below is based on that of the Fortran 90
standard, so that the text may be more concise and accurate:

<ul>
<li><code>OPTIONAL</code> means the argument may be omitted.

<li><code>A-1, A-2, <small>...</small>, A-n</code> means more than one argument
(generally named <code>A</code>) may be specified.

<li><code>scalar</code> means the argument must not be an array (must
be a variable or array element, or perhaps a constant if expressions
are permitted).

<li><code>DIMENSION(4)</code> means the argument must be an array having 4 elements.

<li><code>INTENT(IN)</code> means the argument must be an expression
(such as a constant or a variable that is defined upon invocation
of the intrinsic).

<li><code>INTENT(OUT)</code> means the argument must be definable by the
invocation of the intrinsic (that is, must not be a constant nor
an expression involving operators other than array reference and
substring reference).

<li><code>INTENT(INOUT)</code> means the argument must be defined prior to,
and definable by, invocation of the intrinsic (a combination of
the requirements of <code>INTENT(IN)</code> and <code>INTENT(OUT)</code>.

<li>See <a href="#Kind%20Notation">Kind Notation</a>, for an explanation of <code>KIND</code>. 
</ul>

are not intentional--they result from a bug in the

<h4>Abs Intrinsic</h4>

<pre>Abs(<var>A</var>)
</pre>

<p>Abs: <code>INTEGER</code> or <code>REAL</code> function. 
The exact type depends on that of argument <var>A</var>--if <var>A</var> is
<code>COMPLEX</code>, this function's type is <code>REAL</code>
with the same <code>KIND=</code> value as the type of <var>A</var>. 
Otherwise, this function's type is the same as that of <var>A</var>.

<p><var>A</var>: <code>INTEGER</code>, <code>REAL</code>, or <code>COMPLEX</code>; scalar; INTENT(IN).

<p>Intrinsic groups: (standard FORTRAN 77).

<p>Description:

<p>Returns the absolute value of <var>A</var>.

<p>If <var>A</var> is type <code>COMPLEX</code>, the absolute
value is computed as:

<pre>SQRT(REALPART(<var>A</var>)**2, IMAGPART(<var>A</var>)**2)
</pre>

<p>Otherwise, it is computed by negating the <var>A</var> if
it is negative, or returning <var>A</var>.

<p>See <a href="#Sign%20Intrinsic">Sign Intrinsic</a>, for how to explicitly
compute the positive or negative form of the absolute
value of an expression.

</pre>

<p>Char: <code>CHARACTER*1</code> function.

<p><var>I</var>: <code>INTEGER</code>; scalar; INTENT(IN).

<p>Intrinsic groups: (standard FORTRAN 77).

<p>Description:

<p>Returns the character corresponding to the
code specified by <var>I</var>, using the system's
native character set.

<p>Because the system's native character set is used,
the correspondence between character and their codes
is not necessarily the same between GNU Fortran
implementations.

<p>Note that no intrinsic exists to convert a numerical
value to a printable character string. 
For example, there is no intrinsic that, given
an <code>INTEGER</code> or <code>REAL</code> argument with the
value <code>154</code>, returns the <code>CHARACTER</code>
result <code>'154'</code>.

<p>Instead, you can use internal-file I/O to do this kind
of conversion. 
For example:

<pre>INTEGER VALUE
CHARACTER*10 STRING
VALUE = 154
WRITE (STRING, '(I10)'), VALUE
PRINT *, STRING
END
</pre>

<p>The above program, when run, prints:

<pre>        154
</pre>

<p>See <a href="#IChar%20Intrinsic">IChar Intrinsic</a>, for the inverse of the <code>CHAR</code> function.

<p>Description:

<p>Sets the current working directory to be <var>Dir</var>. 
If the <var>Status</var> argument is supplied, it contains 0
on success or a non-zero error code otherwise upon return. 
See <code>chdir(3)</code>.

<p><em>Caution:</em> Using this routine during I/O to a unit connected with a
non-absolute file name can cause subsequent I/O on such a unit to fail
because the I/O library might reopen files by name.

<p>Some non-GNU implementations of Fortran provide this intrinsic as

<p><var>Status</var>: <code>INTEGER(KIND=1)</code>; OPTIONAL; scalar; INTENT(OUT).

<p>Intrinsic groups: <code>unix</code>.

<p>Description:

<p>Changes the access mode of file <var>Name</var> according to the
specification <var>Mode</var>, which is given in the format of
<code>chmod(1)</code>. 
A null character (<code>CHAR(0)</code>) marks the end of
the name in <var>Name</var>--otherwise,
trailing blanks in <var>Name</var> are ignored. 
Currently, <var>Name</var> must not contain the single quote
character.

<p>If the <var>Status</var> argument is supplied, it contains
0 on success or a non-zero error code upon return.

<p>Note that this currently works
by actually invoking <code>/bin/chmod</code> (or the <code>chmod</code> found when
the library was configured) and so might fail in some circumstances and
will, anyway, be slow.

<p>Some non-GNU implementations of Fortran provide this intrinsic as

<h4>Complex Intrinsic</h4>

<p>Complex: <code>COMPLEX</code> function, the exact type being the result of cross-promoting the

<p><var>Real</var>: <code>INTEGER</code> or <code>REAL</code>; scalar; INTENT(IN).

<p><var>Imag</var>: <code>INTEGER</code> or <code>REAL</code>; scalar; INTENT(IN).

<p>Intrinsic groups: <code>gnu</code>.

<p>Description:

<p>Returns a <code>COMPLEX</code> value that has <code>Real</code> and <code>Imag</code> as its
real and imaginary parts, respectively.

<p>If <var>Real</var> and <var>Imag</var> are the same type, and that type is not
<code>INTEGER</code>, no data conversion is performed, and the type of
the resulting value has the same kind value as the types
of <var>Real</var> and <var>Imag</var>.

<p>If <var>Real</var> and <var>Imag</var> are not the same type, the usual type-promotion
rules are applied to both, converting either or both to the
appropriate <code>REAL</code> type. 
The type of the resulting value has the same kind value as the
type to which both <var>Real</var> and <var>Imag</var> were converted, in this case.

<p>If <var>Real</var> and <var>Imag</var> are both <code>INTEGER</code>, they are both converted
to <code>REAL(KIND=1)</code>, and the result of the <code>COMPLEX()</code>
invocation is type <code>COMPLEX(KIND=1)</code>.

<p><em>Note:</em> The way to do this in standard Fortran 90
is too hairy to describe here, but it is important to
note that <code>CMPLX(D1,D2)</code> returns a <code>COMPLEX(KIND=1)</code>
result even if <code>D1</code> and <code>D2</code> are type <code>REAL(KIND=2)</code>. 
Hence the availability of <code>COMPLEX()</code> in GNU Fortran.

<h4>IChar Intrinsic</h4>

<pre>IChar(<var>C</var>)
</pre>

<p>IChar: <code>INTEGER(KIND=1)</code> function.

<p><var>C</var>: <code>CHARACTER</code>; scalar; INTENT(IN).

<p>Intrinsic groups: (standard FORTRAN 77).

<p>Description:

<p>Returns the code for the character in the
first character position of <var>C</var>.

<p>Because the system's native character set is used,
the correspondence between character and their codes
is not necessarily the same between GNU Fortran
implementations.

<p>Note that no intrinsic exists to convert a printable
character string to a numerical value. 
For example, there is no intrinsic that, given
the <code>CHARACTER</code> value <code>'154'</code>, returns an
<code>INTEGER</code> or <code>REAL</code> value with the value <code>154</code>.

<p>Instead, you can use internal-file I/O to do this kind
of conversion. 
For example:

<pre>INTEGER VALUE
CHARACTER*10 STRING
STRING = '154'
READ (STRING, '(I10)'), VALUE
PRINT *, VALUE
END
</pre>

<p>The above program, when run, prints:

<pre> 154
</pre>

<p>See <a href="#Char%20Intrinsic">Char Intrinsic</a>, for the inverse of the <code>ICHAR</code> function.

<p>See <a href="#IAChar%20Intrinsic">IAChar Intrinsic</a>, for the function corresponding
to the ASCII character set.

<h4>IDate Intrinsic (UNIX)</h4>

<pre>CALL IDate(<var>TArray</var>)
</pre>

<p><var>TArray</var>: <code>INTEGER(KIND=1)</code>; DIMENSION(3); INTENT(OUT).

<p>Intrinsic groups: <code>unix</code>.

<p>Description:

<p>Fills <var>TArray</var> with the numerical values at the current local time
of day, month (in the range 1-12), and year in elements 1, 2, and 3,
respectively. 
The year has four significant digits.

<p>Programs making use of this intrinsic
might not be Year 10000 (Y10K) compliant. 
For example, the date might appear,
to such programs, to wrap around
(change from a larger value to a smaller one)
as of the Year 10000.

<code>srand(0)</code>; if <var>Flag</var> has any other value,
it is used as a new seed with <code>srand()</code>.

<p>See <a href="#SRand%20Intrinsic">SRand Intrinsic</a>.

<p><em>Note:</em> As typically implemented (by the routine of the same
name in the C library), this random number generator is a very poor
one, though the BSD and GNU libraries provide a much better
implementation than the `traditional' one. 
On a different system you almost certainly want to use something better.

<p><var>String_B</var>: <code>CHARACTER</code>; scalar; INTENT(IN).

<p>Intrinsic groups: (standard FORTRAN 77).

<p>Description:

<p>Returns <code>.TRUE.</code> if <code><var>String_A</var>.GE.<var>String_B</var></code>,
<code>.FALSE.</code> otherwise. 
<var>String_A</var> and <var>String_B</var> are interpreted as containing
ASCII character codes. 
If either value contains a character not in the ASCII
character set, the result is processor dependent.

<p>If the <var>String_A</var> and <var>String_B</var> are not the same length,
the shorter is compared as if spaces were appended to
it to form a value that has the same length as the longer.

<p>The lexical comparison intrinsics <code>LGe</code>, <code>LGt</code>,
<code>LLe</code>, and <code>LLt</code> differ from the corresponding
intrinsic operators <code>.GE.</code>, <code>.GT.</code>,
<code>.LE.</code>, <code>.LT.</code>. 
Because the ASCII collating sequence is assumed,
the following expressions always return <code>.TRUE.</code>:

<pre>LGE ('0', ' ')
LGE ('A', '0')
LGE ('a', 'A')
</pre>

<p>The following related expressions do <em>not</em> always
return <code>.TRUE.</code>, as they are not necessarily evaluated
assuming the arguments use ASCII encoding:

<pre>'0' .GE. ' '
'A' .GE. '0'
'a' .GE. 'A'
</pre>

<p>The same difference exists
between <code>LGt</code> and <code>.GT.</code>;
between <code>LLe</code> and <code>.LE.</code>; and
between <code>LLt</code> and <code>.LT.</code>.

<h4>MClock Intrinsic</h4>

<pre>MClock()
</pre>

<p>MClock: <code>INTEGER(KIND=1)</code> function.

<p>Intrinsic groups: <code>unix</code>.

<p>Description:

<p>Returns the number of clock ticks since the start of the process. 
Supported on systems with <code>clock(3)</code> (q.v.).

<p>This intrinsic is not fully portable, such as to systems
with 32-bit <code>INTEGER</code> types but supporting times
wider than 32 bits. 
Therefore, the values returned by this intrinsic
might be, or become, negative,
or numerically less than previous values,
during a single run of the compiled program.

<p>See <a href="#MClock8%20Intrinsic">MClock8 Intrinsic</a>, for information on a
similar intrinsic that might be portable to more
GNU Fortran implementations, though to fewer
Fortran compilers.

<p>If the system does not support <code>clock(3)</code>,
-1 is returned.

<h4>MClock8 Intrinsic</h4>

<pre>MClock8()
</pre>

<p>MClock8: <code>INTEGER(KIND=2)</code> function.

<p>Intrinsic groups: <code>unix</code>.

<p>Description:

<p>Returns the number of clock ticks since the start of the process. 
Supported on systems with <code>clock(3)</code> (q.v.).

<p><em>Warning:</em> this intrinsic does not increase the range
of the timing values over that returned by <code>clock(3)</code>. 
On a system with a 32-bit <code>clock(3)</code>,
<code>MCLOCK8</code> will return a 32-bit value,
even though converted to an <code>INTEGER(KIND=2)</code> value. 
That means overflows of the 32-bit value can still occur. 
Therefore, the values returned by this intrinsic
might be, or become, negative,
or numerically less than previous values,
during a single run of the compiled program.

<p>No Fortran implementations other than GNU Fortran are
known to support this intrinsic at the time of this
writing. 
See <a href="#MClock%20Intrinsic">MClock Intrinsic</a>, for information on a
similar intrinsic that might be portable to more Fortran
compilers, though to fewer GNU Fortran implementations.

<p>If the system does not support <code>clock(3)</code>,
-1 is returned.

<p>Real: <code>REAL</code> function. 
The exact type is <code>REAL(KIND=1)</code> when argument <var>A</var> is

When <var>A</var> is any <code>COMPLEX</code> type other than <code>COMPLEX(KIND=1)</code>,
this intrinsic is valid only when used as the argument to
<code>REAL()</code>, as explained below.

<p><var>A</var>: <code>INTEGER</code>, <code>REAL</code>, or <code>COMPLEX</code>; scalar; INTENT(IN).

<p>Intrinsic groups: (standard FORTRAN 77).

<p>Description:

<p>Converts <var>A</var> to <code>REAL(KIND=1)</code>.

<p>Use of <code>REAL()</code> with a <code>COMPLEX</code> argument
(other than <code>COMPLEX(KIND=1)</code>) is restricted to the following case:

<pre>REAL(REAL(A))
</pre>

<p>This expression converts the real part of A to

<p>Intrinsic groups: <code>gnu</code>.

<p>Description:

<p>The real part of <var>Z</var> is returned, without conversion.

<p><em>Note:</em> The way to do this in standard Fortran 90
is <code>REAL(<var>Z</var>)</code>. 
However, when, for example, <var>Z</var> is <code>COMPLEX(KIND=2)</code>,
<code>REAL(<var>Z</var>)</code> means something different for some compilers
that are not true Fortran 90 compilers but offer some
extensions standardized by Fortran 90 (such as the
<code>DOUBLE COMPLEX</code> type, also known as <code>COMPLEX(KIND=2)</code>).

<p>The advantage of <code>REALPART()</code> is that, while not necessarily
more or less portable than <code>REAL()</code>, it is more likely to
cause a compiler that doesn't support it to produce a diagnostic
than generate incorrect code.

<h4>RShift Intrinsic</h4>

<pre>RShift(<var>I</var>, <var>Shift</var>)

<p>RShift: <code>INTEGER</code> function, the <code>KIND=</code> value of the type being that of argument <var>I</var>.

<p><var>I</var>: <code>INTEGER</code>; scalar; INTENT(IN).

<p>Intrinsic groups: <code>f2c</code>.

<p>Description:

<p>Returns <var>I</var> shifted to the right
<var>Shift</var> bits.

<p>Although similar to the expression
<code><var>I</var>/(2**<var>Shift</var>)</code>, there
are important differences. 
For example, the sign of the result is
undefined.

<p>Currently this intrinsic is defined assuming
the underlying representation of <var>I</var>
is as a two's-complement integer. 
It is unclear at this point whether that
definition will apply when a different
representation is involved.

<p>See <a href="#RShift%20Intrinsic">RShift Intrinsic</a>, for the inverse of this function.

<p>See <a href="#IShft%20Intrinsic">IShft Intrinsic</a>, for information

<p>On some systems, the underlying timings are represented
using types with sufficiently small limits that overflows

<h4>Signal Intrinsic (subroutine)</h4>

<pre>CALL Signal(<var>Number</var>, <var>Handler</var>, <var>Status</var>)
</pre>

<p><var>Number</var>: <code>INTEGER</code>; scalar; INTENT(IN).

<p><var>Handler</var>: Signal handler (<code>INTEGER FUNCTION</code> or <code>SUBROUTINE</code>)
or dummy/global <code>INTEGER(KIND=1)</code> scalar.

<p><var>Status</var>: <code>INTEGER(KIND=7)</code>; OPTIONAL; scalar; INTENT(OUT).

<p>Intrinsic groups: <code>unix</code>.

<p>Description:

<p>If <var>Handler</var> is a an <code>EXTERNAL</code> routine, arranges for it to be
invoked with a single integer argument (of system-dependent length)
when signal <var>Number</var> occurs. 
If <var>Handler</var> is an integer, it can be
used to turn off handling of signal <var>Number</var> or revert to its default
action. 
See <code>signal(2)</code>.

<p>Note that <var>Handler</var> will be called using C conventions,
so the value of its argument in Fortran terms
Fortran terms is obtained by applying <code>%LOC()</code> (or <var>LOC()</var>) to it.

<p>The value returned by <code>signal(2)</code> is written to <var>Status</var>, if
that argument is supplied. 
Otherwise the return value is ignored.

<p>Some non-GNU implementations of Fortran provide this intrinsic as
only a function, not as a subroutine, or do not support the
(optional) <var>Status</var> argument.

<p><em>Warning:</em> Use of the <code>libf2c</code> run-time library function
<code>signal_</code> directly
(such as via <code>EXTERNAL SIGNAL</code>)
requires use of the <code>%VAL()</code> construct
to pass an <code>INTEGER</code> value
(such as <code>SIG_IGN</code> or <code>SIG_DFL</code>)
for the <var>Handler</var> argument.

<p>However, while <code>CALL SIGNAL(<var>signum</var>, %VAL(SIG_IGN))</code>
works when <code>SIGNAL</code> is treated as an external procedure
(and resolves, at link time, to <code>libf2c</code>'s <code>signal_</code> routine),
this construct is not valid when <code>SIGNAL</code> is recognized
as the intrinsic of that name.

<p>Therefore, for maximum portability and reliability,
code such references to the <code>SIGNAL</code> facility as follows:

<pre>INTRINSIC SIGNAL
<small>...</small>
CALL SIGNAL(<var>signum</var>, SIG_IGN)
</pre>

<p><code>g77</code> will compile such a call correctly,
while other compilers will generally either do so as well
or reject the <code>INTRINSIC SIGNAL</code> statement via a diagnostic,
allowing you to take appropriate action.

<p><var>Status</var>: <code>INTEGER(KIND=1)</code>; OPTIONAL; scalar; INTENT(OUT).

<p>Intrinsic groups: <code>unix</code>.

<p>Description:

<p>Passes the command <var>Command</var> to a shell (see <code>system(3)</code>). 
If argument <var>Status</var> is present, it contains the value returned by
<code>system(3)</code>, presumably 0 if the shell command succeeded. 
Note that which shell is used to invoke the command is system-dependent
and environment-dependent.

<p>Some non-GNU implementations of Fortran provide this intrinsic as
only a function, not as a subroutine, or do not support the
(optional) <var>Status</var> argument.

<h4>System_Clock Intrinsic</h4>

<pre>CALL System_Clock(<var>Count</var>, <var>Rate</var>, <var>Max</var>)
</pre>

<p><var>Count</var>: <code>INTEGER(KIND=1)</code>; scalar; INTENT(OUT).

<p><var>Rate</var>: <code>INTEGER(KIND=1)</code>; OPTIONAL; scalar; INTENT(OUT).

<p><var>Max</var>: <code>INTEGER(KIND=1)</code>; OPTIONAL; scalar; INTENT(OUT).

<p>Intrinsic groups: <code>f90</code>.

<p>Description:

<p>Returns in <var>Count</var> the current value of the system clock; this is
the value returned by the UNIX function <code>times(2)</code>
in this implementation, but
isn't in general. 
<var>Rate</var> is the number of clock ticks per second and
<var>Max</var> is the maximum value this can take, which isn't very useful
in this implementation since it's just the maximum C <code>unsigned
int</code> value.

<p>On some systems, the underlying timings are represented
using types with sufficiently small limits that overflows
(wraparounds) are possible, such as 32-bit types. 
Therefore, the values returned by this intrinsic
might be, or become, negative,
or numerically less than previous values,
during a single run of the compiled program.

<h4>Time Intrinsic (UNIX)</h4>

<pre>Time()
</pre>

<p>Time: <code>INTEGER(KIND=1)</code> function.

<p>Intrinsic groups: <code>unix</code>.

<p>Description:

<p>Returns the current time encoded as an integer
(in the manner of the UNIX function <code>time(3)</code>). 
This value is suitable for passing to <code>CTIME</code>,
<code>GMTIME</code>, and <code>LTIME</code>.

<p>This intrinsic is not fully portable, such as to systems
with 32-bit <code>INTEGER</code> types but supporting times
wider than 32 bits. 
Therefore, the values returned by this intrinsic
might be, or become, negative,
or numerically less than previous values,
during a single run of the compiled program.

<p>See <a href="#Time8%20Intrinsic">Time8 Intrinsic</a>, for information on a
similar intrinsic that might be portable to more
GNU Fortran implementations, though to fewer
Fortran compilers.

<h4>Time8 Intrinsic</h4>

<pre>Time8()
</pre>

<p>Time8: <code>INTEGER(KIND=2)</code> function.

<p>Intrinsic groups: <code>unix</code>.

<p>Description:

<p>Returns the current time encoded as a long integer
(in the manner of the UNIX function <code>time(3)</code>). 
This value is suitable for passing to <code>CTIME</code>,
<code>GMTIME</code>, and <code>LTIME</code>.

<p><em>Warning:</em> this intrinsic does not increase the range
of the timing values over that returned by <code>time(3)</code>. 
On a system with a 32-bit <code>time(3)</code>,
<code>TIME8</code> will return a 32-bit value,
even though converted to an <code>INTEGER(KIND=2)</code> value. 
That means overflows of the 32-bit value can still occur. 
Therefore, the values returned by this intrinsic
might be, or become, negative,
or numerically less than previous values,
during a single run of the compiled program.

<p>No Fortran implementations other than GNU Fortran are
known to support this intrinsic at the time of this
writing. 
See <a href="#Time%20Intrinsic%20(UNIX)">Time Intrinsic (UNIX)</a>, for information on a
similar intrinsic that might be portable to more Fortran

<h1>Other Dialects</h1>

<p>GNU Fortran supports a variety of features that are not
considered part of the GNU Fortran language itself, but
are representative of various dialects of Fortran that
<code>g77</code> supports in whole or in part.

<p>Any of the features listed below might be disallowed by
<code>g77</code> unless some command-line option is specified. 
Currently, some of the features are accepted using the
default invocation of <code>g77</code>, but that might change
in the future.

<h2>Source Form</h2>

<p>GNU Fortran accepts programs written in either fixed form or
free form.

<p>Fixed form
corresponds to ANSI FORTRAN 77 (plus popular extensions, such as
allowing tabs) and Fortran 90's fixed form.

<p>Free form corresponds to
Fortran 90's free form (though possibly not entirely up-to-date, and
without complaining about some things that for which Fortran 90 requires
diagnostics, such as the spaces in the constant in <code>R = 3 . 1</code>).

<p>The way a Fortran compiler views source files depends entirely on the
implementation choices made for the compiler, since those choices
are explicitly left to the implementation by the published Fortran
standards. 
GNU Fortran currently tries to be somewhat like a few popular compilers
(<code>f2c</code>, Digital ("DEC") Fortran, and so on), though a cleaner default
definition along with more
flexibility offered by command-line options is likely to be offered
in version 0.6.

<p>This section describes how <code>g77</code> interprets source lines.

<ul>
<li><a href="#Carriage%20Returns">Carriage Returns</a>:   Carriage returns ignored. 
<li><a href="#Tabs">Tabs</a>:               Tabs converted to spaces. 
<li><a href="#Short%20Lines">Short Lines</a>:        Short lines padded with spaces (fixed-form only). 
<li><a href="#Long%20Lines">Long Lines</a>:         Long lines truncated. 
<li><a href="#Ampersands">Ampersands</a>:         Special Continuation Lines. 
</ul>

<br>

<h3>Carriage Returns</h3>

<p>Carriage returns (<code>\r</code>) in source lines are ignored. 
This is somewhat different from <code>f2c</code>, which seems to treat them as
spaces outside character/Hollerith constants, and encodes them as <code>\r</code>
inside such constants.

Node:<a name="Tabs">Tabs</a>,
Next:<a rel=next href="#Short%20Lines">Short Lines</a>,
Previous:<a rel=previous href="#Carriage%20Returns">Carriage Returns</a>,
Up:<a rel=up href="#Source%20Form">Source Form</a>
<br>

<h3>Tabs</h3>

<p>A source line with a &lt;TAB&gt; character anywhere in it is treated as
entirely significant--however long it is--instead of ending in
column 72 (for fixed-form source) or 132 (for free-form source). 
This also is different from <code>f2c</code>, which encodes tabs as
<code>\t</code> (the ASCII &lt;TAB&gt; character) inside character
and Hollerith constants, but nevertheless seems to treat the column
position as if it had been affected by the canonical tab positioning.

<p><code>g77</code> effectively
translates tabs to the appropriate number of spaces (a la the default
for the UNIX <code>expand</code> command) before doing any other processing, other
than (currently) noting whether a tab was found on a line and using this
information to decide how to interpret the length of the line and continued
constants.

<p>Note that this default behavior probably will change for version 0.6,
when it will presumably be available via a command-line option. 
The default as of version 0.6 is planned to be a "pure visual"
model, where tabs are immediately
converted to spaces and otherwise have no effect, so the way a typical
user sees source lines produces a consistent result no matter how the
spacing in those source lines is actually implemented via tabs, spaces,
and trailing tabs/spaces before newline. 
Command-line options are likely to be added to specify whether all or
just-tabbed lines are to be extended to 132 or full input-line length,
and perhaps even an option will be added to specify the truncated-line
behavior to which some Digital compilers default (and which affects
the way continued character/Hollerith constants are interpreted).

<br>

<h3>Short Lines</h3>

<p>Source lines shorter than the applicable fixed-form length are treated as
if they were padded with spaces to that length. 
(None of this is relevant to source files written in free form.)

<p>This affects only
continued character and Hollerith constants, and is a different
interpretation than provided by some other popular compilers
(although a bit more consistent with the traditional punched-card
basis of Fortran and the way the Fortran standard expressed fixed
source form).

<p><code>g77</code> might someday offer an option to warn about cases where differences
might be seen as a result of this treatment, and perhaps an option to
specify the alternate behavior as well.

<p>Note that this padding cannot apply to lines that are effectively of
infinite length--such lines are specified using command-line options
like <code>-ffixed-line-length-none</code>, for example.

<h3>Long Lines</h3>

<p>Source lines longer than the applicable length are truncated to that
length. 
Currently, <code>g77</code> does not warn if the truncated characters are
not spaces, to accommodate existing code written for systems that
treated truncated text as commentary (especially in columns 73 through 80).

<p>See <a href="#Fortran%20Dialect%20Options">Options Controlling Fortran Dialect</a>,
for information on the <code>-ffixed-line-length-<var>n</var></code> option,
which can be used to set the line length applicable to fixed-form
source files.

<h3>Ampersand Continuation Line</h3>

<p>A <code>&amp;</code> in column 1 of fixed-form source denotes an arbitrary-length
continuation line, imitating the behavior of <code>f2c</code>.

<h2>Trailing Comment</h2>

<p><code>g77</code> supports use of <code>/*</code> to start a trailing
comment. 
In the GNU Fortran language, <code>!</code> is used for this purpose.

<p><code>/*</code> is not in the GNU Fortran language
because the use of <code>/*</code> in a program might
suggest to some readers that a block, not trailing, comment is
started (and thus ended by <code>*/</code>, not end of line),
since that is the meaning of <code>/*</code> in C.

<p>Also, such readers might think they can use <code>//</code> to start
a trailing comment as an alternative to <code>/*</code>, but
<code>//</code> already denotes concatenation, and such a "comment"
might actually result in a program that compiles without
error (though it would likely behave incorrectly).

<br>

<h2>Debug Line</h2>

<p>Use of <code>D</code> or <code>d</code> as the first character (column 1) of
a source line denotes a debug line.

<p>In turn, a debug line is treated as either a comment line
or a normal line, depending on whether debug lines are enabled.

<p>When treated as a comment line, a line beginning with <code>D</code> or
<code>d</code> is treated as if it the first character was <code>C</code> or <code>c</code>, respectively. 
When treated as a normal line, such a line is treated as if
the first character was &lt;SPC&gt; (space).

<p>(Currently, <code>g77</code> provides no means for treating debug
lines as normal lines.)

<h2>Case Sensitivity</h2>

<p>GNU Fortran offers the programmer way too much flexibility in deciding
how source files are to be treated vis-a-vis uppercase and lowercase
characters. 
There are 66 useful settings that affect case sensitivity, plus 10
settings that are nearly useless, with the remaining 116 settings
being either redundant or useless.

<p>None of these settings have any effect on the contents of comments
(the text after a <code>c</code> or <code>C</code> in Column 1, for example)
or of character or Hollerith constants. 
Note that things like the <code>E</code> in the statement
<code>CALL FOO(3.2E10)</code> and the <code>TO</code> in <code>ASSIGN 10 TO LAB</code>
are considered built-in keywords, and so are affected by
these settings.

<p>Low-level switches are identified in this section as follows:

<ul>
<li>A
Source Case Conversion:

<ul>
<li>0
Preserve (see Note 1)
<li>1
Convert to Upper Case
<li>2
Convert to Lower Case
</ul>

<li>B
Built-in Keyword Matching:

<ul>
<li>0
Match Any Case (per-character basis)
<li>1
Match Upper Case Only
<li>2
Match Lower Case Only
<li>3
Match InitialCaps Only (see tables for spellings)
</ul>

<li>C
Built-in Intrinsic Matching:

<ul>
<li>0
Match Any Case (per-character basis)
<li>1
Match Upper Case Only
<li>2
Match Lower Case Only
<li>3
Match InitialCaps Only (see tables for spellings)
</ul>

<li>D
User-defined Symbol Possibilities (warnings only):

<ul>
<li>0
Allow Any Case (per-character basis)
<li>1
Allow Upper Case Only
<li>2
Allow Lower Case Only
<li>3
Allow InitialCaps Only (see Note 2)
</ul>
</ul>

<p>Note 1: <code>g77</code> eventually will support <code>NAMELIST</code> in a manner that is
consistent with these source switches--in the sense that input will be
expected to meet the same requirements as source code in terms
of matching symbol names and keywords (for the exponent letters).

<p>Currently, however, <code>NAMELIST</code> is supported by <code>libg2c</code>,
which uppercases <code>NAMELIST</code> input and symbol names for matching. 
This means not only that <code>NAMELIST</code> output currently shows symbol
(and keyword) names in uppercase even if lower-case source
conversion (option A2) is selected, but that <code>NAMELIST</code> cannot be
adequately supported when source case preservation (option A0)
is selected.

<p>If A0 is selected, a warning message will be
output for each <code>NAMELIST</code> statement to this effect. 
The behavior
of the program is undefined at run time if two or more symbol names
appear in a given <code>NAMELIST</code> such that the names are identical
when converted to upper case (e.g. <code>NAMELIST /X/ VAR, Var, var</code>). 
For complete and total elegance, perhaps there should be a warning
when option A2 is selected, since the output of NAMELIST is currently
in uppercase but will someday be lowercase (when a <code>libg77</code> is written),
but that seems to be overkill for a product in beta test.

<p>Note 2: Rules for InitialCaps names are:

<ul>
<li>Must be a single uppercase letter, <strong>or</strong>
<li>Must start with an uppercase letter and contain at least one
lowercase letter. 
</ul>

<p>So <code>A</code>, <code>Ab</code>, <code>ABc</code>, <code>AbC</code>, and <code>Abc</code> are
valid InitialCaps names, but <code>AB</code>, <code>A2</code>, and <code>ABC</code> are
not. 
Note that most, but not all, built-in names meet these
requirements--the exceptions are some of the two-letter format
specifiers, such as <code>BN</code> and <code>BZ</code>.

<p>Here are the names of the corresponding command-line options:

<pre>A0: -fsource-case-preserve
A1: -fsource-case-upper
A2: -fsource-case-lower

B0: -fmatch-case-any
B1: -fmatch-case-upper
B2: -fmatch-case-lower
B3: -fmatch-case-initcap

C0: -fintrin-case-any
C1: -fintrin-case-upper
C2: -fintrin-case-lower
C3: -fintrin-case-initcap

D0: -fsymbol-case-any
D1: -fsymbol-case-upper
D2: -fsymbol-case-lower
D3: -fsymbol-case-initcap
</pre>

option names that set some of these combinations all at once:

</pre>

<p>Number 22 is the "strict" ANSI FORTRAN 77 model wherein all input
(except comments, character constants, and Hollerith strings) must
be entered in uppercase. 
Use <code>-fcase-strict-upper</code> to specify this
combination.

<p>Number 43 is like Number 22 except all input must be lowercase.  Use
<code>-fcase-strict-lower</code> to specify this combination.

<p>Number 65 is the "classic" ANSI FORTRAN 77 model as implemented on many
non-UNIX machines whereby all the source is translated to uppercase. 
Use <code>-fcase-upper</code> to specify this combination.

<p>Number 66 is the "canonical" UNIX model whereby all the source is
translated to lowercase. 
Use <code>-fcase-lower</code> to specify this combination.

<p>There are a few nearly useless combinations:

<pre>67: A-1-  B01--  C01--  D--2-
68: A-1-  B01--  C01--  D---3
69: A-1-  B01--  C--23  D01--
70: A-1-  B01--  C--23  D--2-
71: A-1-  B01--  C--23  D---3
72: A--2  B01--  C0-2-  D-1--
73: A--2  B01--  C0-2-  D---3
74: A--2  B01--  C-1-3  D0-2-
75: A--2  B01--  C-1-3  D-1--
76: A--2  B01--  C-1-3  D---3
</pre>

<p>The above allow some programs to be compiled but with restrictions that
make most useful programs impossible: Numbers 67 and 72 warn about
<em>any</em> user-defined symbol names (such as <code>SUBROUTINE FOO</code>);
Numbers
68 and 73 warn about any user-defined symbol names longer than one
character that don't have at least one non-alphabetic character after
the first;
Numbers 69 and 74 disallow any references to intrinsics;
and Numbers 70, 71, 75, and 76 are combinations of the restrictions in
67+69, 68+69, 72+74, and 73+74, respectively.

<p>All redundant combinations are shown in the above tables anyplace
where more than one setting is shown for a low-level switch. 
For example, <code>B0-2-</code> means either setting 0 or 2 is valid for switch B. 
The "proper" setting in such a case is the one that copies the setting
of switch A--any other setting might slightly reduce the speed of
the compiler, though possibly to an unmeasurable extent.

<p>All remaining combinations are useless in that they prevent successful
compilation of non-null source files (source files with something other
than comments).

<h2>VXT Fortran</h2>

<p><code>g77</code> supports certain constructs that
have different meanings in VXT Fortran than they
do in the GNU Fortran language.

<p>Generally, this manual uses the invented term VXT Fortran to refer
VAX FORTRAN (circa v4). 
That compiler offered many popular features, though not necessarily
those that are specific to the VAX processor architecture,
the VMS operating system,
or Digital Equipment Corporation's Fortran product line. 
(VAX and VMS probably are trademarks of Digital Equipment
Corporation.)

<p>An extension offered by a Digital Fortran product that also is
offered by several other Fortran products for different kinds of
systems is probably going to be considered for inclusion in <code>g77</code>
someday, and is considered a VXT Fortran feature.

<p>The <code>-fvxt</code> option generally specifies that, where
the meaning of a construct is ambiguous (means one thing
in GNU Fortran and another in VXT Fortran), the VXT Fortran
meaning is to be assumed.

<ul>
<li><a href="#Double%20Quote%20Meaning">Double Quote Meaning</a>:   <code>"2000</code> as octal constant. 
<li><a href="#Exclamation%20Point">Exclamation Point</a>:      <code>!</code> in column 6. 
</ul>

<br>

<h3>Meaning of Double Quote</h3>

<p><code>g77</code> treats double-quote (<code>"</code>)
as beginning an octal constant of <code>INTEGER(KIND=1)</code> type
when the <code>-fvxt</code> option is specified. 
The form of this octal constant is

<pre>"<var>octal-digits</var>
</pre>

<p>where <var>octal-digits</var> is a nonempty string of characters in
the set <code>01234567</code>.

<p>For example, the <code>-fvxt</code> option permits this:

<pre>PRINT *, "20
END
</pre>

<p>The above program would print the value <code>16</code>.

<p>See <a href="#Integer%20Type">Integer Type</a>, for information on the preferred construct
for integer constants specified using GNU Fortran's octal notation.

<p>(In the GNU Fortran language, the double-quote character (<code>"</code>)
delimits a character constant just as does apostrophe (<code>'</code>). 
There is no way to allow
both constructs in the general case, since statements like
<code>PRINT *,"2000 !comment?"</code> would be ambiguous.)

<h3>Meaning of Exclamation Point in Column 6</h3>

<p><code>g77</code> treats an exclamation point (<code>!</code>) in column 6 of
a fixed-form source file
as a continuation character rather than
as the beginning of a comment
(as it does in any other column)
when the <code>-fvxt</code> option is specified.

<p>The following program, when run, prints a message indicating
whether it is interpreted according to GNU Fortran (and Fortran 90)
rules or VXT Fortran rules:

<pre>C234567  (This line begins in column 1.)
      I = 0
     !1
      IF (I.EQ.0) PRINT *, ' I am a VXT Fortran program'
      IF (I.EQ.1) PRINT *, ' I am a Fortran 90 program'
      IF (I.LT.0 .OR. I.GT.1) PRINT *, ' I am a HAL 9000 computer'
      END
</pre>

<p>(In the GNU Fortran and Fortran 90 languages, exclamation point is
a valid character and, unlike space (&lt;SPC&gt;) or zero (<code>0</code>),
marks a line as a continuation line when it appears in column 6.)

<h2>Fortran 90</h2>

<p>The GNU Fortran language includes a number of features that are
part of Fortran 90, even when the <code>-ff90</code> option is not specified. 
The features enabled by <code>-ff90</code> are intended to be those that,
when <code>-ff90</code> is not specified, would have another
meaning to <code>g77</code>--usually meaning something invalid in the
GNU Fortran language.

<p>So, the purpose of <code>-ff90</code> is not to specify whether <code>g77</code> is
to gratuitously reject Fortran 90 constructs. 
The <code>-pedantic</code> option specified with <code>-fno-f90</code> is intended
to do that, although its implementation is certainly incomplete at
this point.

<p>When <code>-ff90</code> is specified:

<ul>
<li>The type of <code>REAL(<var>expr</var>)</code> and <code>AIMAG(<var>expr</var>)</code>,
where <var>expr</var> is <code>COMPLEX</code> type,
is the same type as the real part of <var>expr</var>.

<p>For example, assuming <code>Z</code> is type <code>COMPLEX(KIND=2)</code>,
<code>REAL(Z)</code> would return a value of type <code>REAL(KIND=2)</code>,
not of type <code>REAL(KIND=1)</code>, since <code>-ff90</code> is specified. 
</ul>

<br>

<h2>Pedantic Compilation</h2>

<p>The <code>-fpedantic</code> command-line option specifies that <code>g77</code>
is to warn about code that is not standard-conforming. 
This is useful for finding
some extensions <code>g77</code> accepts that other compilers might not accept. 
(Note that the <code>-pedantic</code> and <code>-pedantic-errors</code> options
always imply <code>-fpedantic</code>.)

<p>With <code>-fno-f90</code> in force, ANSI FORTRAN 77 is used as the standard
for conforming code. 
With <code>-ff90</code> in force, Fortran 90 is used.

<p>The constructs for which <code>g77</code> issues diagnostics when <code>-fpedantic</code>
and <code>-fno-f90</code> are in force are:

<ul>
<li>Automatic arrays, as in

<pre>SUBROUTINE X(N)
REAL A(N)
<small>...</small>
</pre>

<p>where <code>A</code> is not listed in any <code>ENTRY</code> statement,
and thus is not a dummy argument.

</p><li>The commas in <code>READ (5), I</code> and <code>WRITE (10), J</code>.

<p>These commas are disallowed by FORTRAN 77, but, while strictly
superfluous, are syntactically elegant,
especially given that commas are required in statements such
as <code>READ 99, I</code> and <code>PRINT *, J</code>. 
Many compilers permit the superfluous commas for this reason.

</p><li><code>DOUBLE COMPLEX</code>, either explicitly or implicitly.

<p>An explicit use of this type is via a <code>DOUBLE COMPLEX</code> or
<code>IMPLICIT DOUBLE COMPLEX</code> statement, for examples.

<p>An example of an implicit use is the expression <code>C*D</code>,
where <code>C</code> is <code>COMPLEX(KIND=1)</code>
and <code>D</code> is <code>DOUBLE PRECISION</code>. 
This expression is prohibited by ANSI FORTRAN 77
because the rules of promotion would suggest that it
produce a <code>DOUBLE COMPLEX</code> result--a type not
provided for by that standard.

</p><li>Automatic conversion of numeric
expressions to <code>INTEGER(KIND=1)</code> in contexts such as:

<ul>
<li>Array-reference indexes. 
<li>Alternate-return values. 
<li>Computed <code>GOTO</code>. 
<li><code>FORMAT</code> run-time expressions (not yet supported). 
<li>Dimension lists in specification statements. 
<li>Numbers for I/O statements (such as <code>READ (UNIT=3.2), I</code>)
<li>Sizes of <code>CHARACTER</code> entities in specification statements. 
<li>Kind types in specification entities (a Fortran 90 feature). 
<li>Initial, terminal, and incrementation parameters for implied-<code>DO</code>
constructs in <code>DATA</code> statements. 
</ul>

<li>Automatic conversion of <code>LOGICAL</code> expressions to <code>INTEGER</code>
in contexts such as arithmetic <code>IF</code> (where <code>COMPLEX</code>
expressions are disallowed anyway).

<li>Zero-size array dimensions, as in:

<pre>INTEGER I(10,20,4:2)
</pre>

<li>Zero-length <code>CHARACTER</code> entities, as in:

<pre>PRINT *, ''
</pre>

<li>Substring operators applied to character constants and named
constants, as in:

<pre>PRINT *, 'hello'(3:5)
</pre>

<li>Null arguments passed to statement function, as in:

<pre>PRINT *, FOO(,3)
</pre>

<li>Disagreement among program units regarding whether a given <code>COMMON</code>
area is <code>SAVE</code>d (for targets where program units in a single source
file are "glued" together as they typically are for UNIX development
environments).

<li>Disagreement among program units regarding the size of a
named <code>COMMON</code> block.

<li>Specification statements following first <code>DATA</code> statement.

<p>(In the GNU Fortran language, <code>DATA I/1/</code> may be followed by <code>INTEGER J</code>,
but not <code>INTEGER I</code>. 
The <code>-fpedantic</code> option disallows both of these.)

</p><li>Semicolon as statement separator, as in:

<pre>CALL FOO; CALL BAR
</pre>

<li>Use of <code>&amp;</code> in column 1 of fixed-form source (to indicate continuation).

<li>Use of <code>CHARACTER</code> constants to initialize numeric entities, and vice
versa.

<li>Expressions having two arithmetic operators in a row, such
as <code>X*-Y</code>. 
</ul>

<p>If <code>-fpedantic</code> is specified along with <code>-ff90</code>, the
following constructs result in diagnostics:

<ul>
<li>Use of semicolon as a statement separator on a line
that has an <code>INCLUDE</code> directive. 
</ul>

<h2>Distensions</h2>

<p>The <code>-fugly-*</code> command-line options determine whether certain
features supported by VAX FORTRAN and other such compilers, but considered
too ugly to be in code that can be changed to use safer and/or more
portable constructs, are accepted. 
These are humorously referred to as "distensions",
extensions that just plain look ugly in the harsh light of day.

<h3>Implicit Argument Conversion</h3>

<p>The <code>-fno-ugly-args</code> option disables
passing typeless and Hollerith constants as actual arguments
in procedure invocations. 
For example:

<pre>CALL FOO(4HABCD)
CALL BAR('123'O)
</pre>

<p>These constructs can be too easily used to create non-portable
code, but are not considered as "ugly" as others. 
Further, they are widely used in existing Fortran source code
in ways that often are quite portable. 
Therefore, they are enabled by default.

<br>

<h3>Ugly Assumed-Size Arrays</h3>

<p>The <code>-fugly-assumed</code> option enables
the treatment of any array with a final dimension specified as <code>1</code>
as an assumed-size array, as if <code>*</code> had been specified
instead.

<p>For example, <code>DIMENSION X(1)</code> is treated as if it
had read <code>DIMENSION X(*)</code> if <code>X</code> is listed as
a dummy argument in a preceding <code>SUBROUTINE</code>, <code>FUNCTION</code>,
or <code>ENTRY</code> statement in the same program unit.

<p>Use an explicit lower bound to avoid this interpretation. 
For example, <code>DIMENSION X(1:1)</code> is never treated as if
it had read <code>DIMENSION X(*)</code> or <code>DIMENSION X(1:*)</code>. 
Nor is <code>DIMENSION X(2-1)</code> affected by this option,
since that kind of expression is unlikely to have been
intended to designate an assumed-size array.

<p>This option is used to prevent warnings being issued about apparent
out-of-bounds reference such as <code>X(2) = 99</code>.

<p>It also prevents the array from being used in contexts that
disallow assumed-size arrays, such as <code>PRINT *,X</code>. 
In such cases, a diagnostic is generated and the source file is
not compiled.

<p>The construct affected by this option is used only in old code
that pre-exists the widespread acceptance of adjustable and assumed-size
arrays in the Fortran community.

<p><em>Note:</em> This option does not affect how <code>DIMENSION X(1)</code> is
treated if <code>X</code> is listed as a dummy argument only
<em>after</em> the <code>DIMENSION</code> statement (presumably in
an <code>ENTRY</code> statement). 
For example, <code>-fugly-assumed</code> has no effect on the
following program unit:

<pre>SUBROUTINE X
REAL A(1)
RETURN
ENTRY Y(A)
PRINT *, A
END
</pre>

<br>

<h3>Ugly Complex Part Extraction</h3>

<p>The <code>-fugly-complex</code> option enables
use of the <code>REAL()</code> and <code>AIMAG()</code>
intrinsics with arguments that are
<code>COMPLEX</code> types other than <code>COMPLEX(KIND=1)</code>.

<p>With <code>-ff90</code> in effect, these intrinsics return
the unconverted real and imaginary parts (respectively)
of their argument.

<p>With <code>-fno-f90</code> in effect, these intrinsics convert
the real and imaginary parts to <code>REAL(KIND=1)</code>, and return
the result of that conversion.

<p>Due to this ambiguity, the GNU Fortran language defines
these constructs as invalid, except in the specific
case where they are entirely and solely passed as an
argument to an invocation of the <code>REAL()</code> intrinsic. 
For example,

<pre>REAL(REAL(Z))
</pre>

<p>is permitted even when <code>Z</code> is <code>COMPLEX(KIND=2)</code>
and <code>-fno-ugly-complex</code> is in effect, because the
meaning is clear.

<p><code>g77</code> enforces this restriction, unless <code>-fugly-complex</code>
is specified, in which case the appropriate interpretation is
chosen and no diagnostic is issued.

<p>See <a href="#CMPAMBIG">CMPAMBIG</a>, for information on how to cope with existing
code with unclear expectations of <code>REAL()</code> and <code>AIMAG()</code>
with <code>COMPLEX(KIND=2)</code> arguments.

<p>See <a href="#RealPart%20Intrinsic">RealPart Intrinsic</a>, for information on the <code>REALPART()</code>
intrinsic, used to extract the real part of a complex expression
without conversion. 
See <a href="#ImagPart%20Intrinsic">ImagPart Intrinsic</a>, for information on the <code>IMAGPART()</code>
intrinsic, used to extract the imaginary part of a complex expression
without conversion.

<br>

<h3>Ugly Null Arguments</h3>

<p>The <code>-fugly-comma</code> option enables use of a single trailing comma
to mean "pass an extra trailing null argument"
in a list of actual arguments to an external procedure,
and use of an empty list of arguments to such a procedure
to mean "pass a single null argument".

<p>(Null arguments often are used in some procedure-calling
schemes to indicate omitted arguments.)

<p>For example, <code>CALL FOO(,)</code> means "pass
two null arguments", rather than "pass one null argument". 
Also, <code>CALL BAR()</code> means "pass one null argument".

<p>This construct is considered "ugly" because it does not
provide an elegant way to pass a single null argument
that is syntactically distinct from passing no arguments. 
That is, this construct changes the meaning of code that
makes no use of the construct.

<p>So, with <code>-fugly-comma</code> in force, <code>CALL FOO()</code>
and <code>I = JFUNC()</code> pass a single null argument, instead
of passing no arguments as required by the Fortran 77 and
90 standards.

<p><em>Note:</em> Many systems gracefully allow the case
where a procedure call passes one extra argument that the
called procedure does not expect.

<p>So, in practice, there might be no difference in
the behavior of a program that does <code>CALL FOO()</code>
or <code>I = JFUNC()</code> and is compiled with <code>-fugly-comma</code>
in force as compared to its behavior when compiled
with the default, <code>-fno-ugly-comma</code>, in force,
assuming <code>FOO</code> and <code>JFUNC</code> do not expect any
arguments to be passed.

<h3>Ugly Conversion of Initializers</h3>

<p>The constructs disabled by <code>-fno-ugly-init</code> are:

<ul>
<li>Use of Hollerith and typeless constants in contexts where they set
initial (compile-time) values for variables, arrays, and named
constants--that is, <code>DATA</code> and <code>PARAMETER</code> statements, plus
type-declaration statements specifying initial values.

<p>Here are some sample initializations that are disabled by the
<code>-fno-ugly-init</code> option:

<pre>PARAMETER (VAL='9A304FFE'X)
REAL*8 STRING/8HOUTPUT00/
DATA VAR/4HABCD/
</pre>

</p><li>In the same contexts as above, use of character constants to initialize
numeric items and vice versa (one constant per item).

<p>Here are more sample initializations that are disabled by the
<code>-fno-ugly-init</code> option:

<pre>INTEGER IA
CHARACTER BELL
PARAMETER (IA = 'A')
PARAMETER (BELL = 7)
</pre>

</p><li>Use of Hollerith and typeless constants on the right-hand side
of assignment statements to numeric types, and in other
contexts (such as passing arguments in invocations of
intrinsic procedures and statement functions) that
are treated as assignments to known types (the dummy
arguments, in these cases).

<p>Here are sample statements that are disabled by the
<code>-fno-ugly-init</code> option:

<pre>IVAR = 4HABCD
PRINT *, IMAX0(2HAB, 2HBA)
</pre>
</ul>

<p>The above constructs, when used,
can tend to result in non-portable code. 
But, they are widely used in existing Fortran code in ways
that often are quite portable. 
Therefore, they are enabled by default.

<br>

<h3>Ugly Integer Conversions</h3>

<p>The constructs enabled via <code>-fugly-logint</code> are:

<ul>
<li>Automatic conversion between <code>INTEGER</code> and <code>LOGICAL</code> as
dictated by
context (typically implies nonportable dependencies on how a
particular implementation encodes <code>.TRUE.</code> and <code>.FALSE.</code>).

<li>Use of a <code>LOGICAL</code> variable in <code>ASSIGN</code> and assigned-<code>GOTO</code>
statements. 
</ul>

<p>The above constructs are disabled by default because use
of them tends to lead to non-portable code. 
Even existing Fortran code that uses that often turns out
to be non-portable, if not outright buggy.

<p>Some of this is due to differences among implementations as
far as how <code>.TRUE.</code> and <code>.FALSE.</code> are encoded as
<code>INTEGER</code> values--Fortran code that assumes a particular
coding is likely to use one of the above constructs, and is
also likely to not work correctly on implementations using
different encodings.

<br>

<h3>Ugly Assigned Labels</h3>

<p>The <code>-fugly-assign</code> option forces <code>g77</code> to use the
same storage for assigned labels as it would for a normal
assignment to the same variable.

<p>For example, consider the following code fragment:

<pre>I = 3
ASSIGN 10 TO I
</pre>

<p>Normally, for portability and improved diagnostics, <code>g77</code>
reserves distinct storage for a "sibling" of <code>I</code>, used
only for <code>ASSIGN</code> statements to that variable (along with
the corresponding assigned-<code>GOTO</code> and assigned-<code>FORMAT</code>-I/O
statements that reference the variable).

<p>However, some code (that violates the ANSI FORTRAN 77 standard)
attempts to copy assigned labels among variables involved with
<code>ASSIGN</code> statements, as in:

<pre>ASSIGN 10 TO I
ISTATE(5) = I
<small>...</small>
J = ISTATE(ICUR)
GOTO J
</pre>

<p>Such code doesn't work under <code>g77</code> unless <code>-fugly-assign</code>
is specified on the command-line, ensuring that the value of <code>I</code>
referenced in the second line is whatever value <code>g77</code> uses
to designate statement label <code>10</code>, so the value may be
copied into the <code>ISTATE</code> array, later retrieved into a
variable of the appropriate type (<code>J</code>), and used as the target of
an assigned-<code>GOTO</code> statement.

<p><em>Note:</em> To avoid subtle program bugs,
when <code>-fugly-assign</code> is specified,
<code>g77</code> requires the type of variables
specified in assigned-label contexts
<em>must</em> be the same type returned by <code>%LOC()</code>. 
On many systems, this type is effectively the same
as <code>INTEGER(KIND=1)</code>, while, on others, it is
effectively the same as <code>INTEGER(KIND=2)</code>.

<p>Do <em>not</em> depend on <code>g77</code> actually writing valid pointers
to these variables, however. 
While <code>g77</code> currently chooses that implementation, it might
be changed in the future.

<p>See <a href="#Assigned%20Statement%20Labels">Assigned Statement Labels (ASSIGN and GOTO)</a>,
for implementation details on assigned-statement labels.

<h1>The GNU Fortran Compiler</h1>

<p>The GNU Fortran compiler, <code>g77</code>, supports programs written
in the GNU Fortran language and in some other dialects of Fortran.

<p>Some aspects of how <code>g77</code> works are universal regardless
of dialect, and yet are not properly part of the GNU Fortran
language itself. 
These are described below.

of work!</em>

<h2>Compiler Limits</h2>

<p><code>g77</code>, as with GNU tools in general, imposes few arbitrary restrictions
on lengths of identifiers, number of continuation lines, number of external
symbols in a program, and so on.

<p>For example, some other Fortran compiler have an option
(such as <code>-Nl<var>x</var></code>) to increase the limit on the
number of continuation lines. 
Also, some Fortran compilation systems have an option
(such as <code>-Nx<var>x</var></code>) to increase the limit on the
number of external symbols.

<p><code>g77</code>, <code>gcc</code>, and GNU <code>ld</code> (the GNU linker) have
no equivalent options, since they do not impose arbitrary
limits in these areas.

<p><code>g77</code> does currently limit the number of dimensions in an array
to the same degree as do the Fortran standards--seven (7). 
This restriction might be lifted in a future version.

<br>

<h2>Run-time Environment Limits</h2>

<p>As a portable Fortran implementation,
<code>g77</code> offers its users direct access to,
and otherwise depends upon,
the underlying facilities of the system
used to build <code>g77</code>,
the system on which <code>g77</code> itself is used to compile programs,
and the system on which the <code>g77</code>-compiled program is actually run. 
(For most users, the three systems are of the same
type--combination of operating environment and hardware--often
the same physical system.)

<p>The run-time environment for a particular system
inevitably imposes some limits on a program's use
of various system facilities. 
These limits vary from system to system.

<p>Even when such limits might be well beyond the
possibility of being encountered on a particular system,
the <code>g77</code> run-time environment
has certain built-in limits,
usually, but not always, stemming from intrinsics
with inherently limited interfaces.

<p>Currently, the <code>g77</code> run-time environment
does not generally offer a less-limiting environment
by augmenting the underlying system's own environment.

<p>Therefore, code written in the GNU Fortran language,
while syntactically and semantically portable,
might nevertheless make non-portable assumptions
about the run-time environment--assumptions that
prove to be false for some particular environments.

<p>The GNU Fortran language,
the <code>g77</code> compiler and run-time environment,
and the <code>g77</code> documentation
do not yet offer comprehensive portable work-arounds for such limits,
though programmers should be able to
find their own in specific instances.

<p>Not all of the limitations are described in this document. 
Some of the known limitations include:

<h3>Timer Wraparounds</h3>

<p>Intrinsics that return values computed from system timers,
whether elapsed (wall-clock) timers,
process CPU timers,
or other kinds of timers,
are prone to experiencing wrap-around errors
(or returning wrapped-around values from successive calls)
due to insufficient ranges
offered by the underlying system's timers.

<p>Some of the symptoms of such behaviors include
apparently negative time being computed for a duration,
an extremely short amount of time being computed for a long duration,
and an extremely long amount of time being computed for a short duration.

<h3>Year 2000 (Y2K) Problems</h3>

<p>While the <code>g77</code> compiler itself is believed to
be Year-2000 (Y2K) compliant,
some intrinsics are not,
and, potentially, some underlying systems are not,
perhaps rendering some Y2K-compliant intrinsics
non-compliant when used on those particular systems.

<p>Fortran code that uses non-Y2K-compliant intrinsics
(listed below)
is, itself, almost certainly not compliant,
and should be modified to use Y2K-compliant intrinsics instead.

<p>Fortran code that uses no non-Y2K-compliant intrinsics,
but which currently is running on a non-Y2K-compliant system,
can be made more Y2K compliant by compiling and
linking it for use on a new Y2K-compliant system,
such as a new version of an old, non-Y2K-compliant, system.

<p>Currently, information on Y2K and related issues
is being maintained at
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/year2000-list.html">http://www.gnu.org/software/year2000-list.html</a>.

<p>See the following for intrinsics
known to have potential problems in these areas
on at least some systems:
<a href="#Date%20Intrinsic">Date Intrinsic</a>,
<a href="#IDate%20Intrinsic%20(VXT)">IDate Intrinsic (VXT)</a>.

<p>The <code>libg2c</code> library
shipped with any <code>g77</code> that warns
about invocation of a non-Y2K-compliant intrinsic
has renamed the <code>EXTERNAL</code> procedure names
of those intrinsics. 
This is done so that
the <code>libg2c</code> implementations of these intrinsics
cannot be directly linked to
as <code>EXTERNAL</code> names
(which normally would avoid the non-Y2K-intrinsic warning).

<p>The renamed forms of the <code>EXTERNAL</code> names
of these renamed procedures
may be linked to
by appending the string <code>_y2kbug</code>
to the name of the procedure
in the source code. 
For example:

<pre>CHARACTER*20 STR
INTEGER YY, MM, DD
EXTERNAL DATE_Y2KBUG, VXTIDATE_Y2KBUG
CALL DATE_Y2KBUG (STR)
CALL VXTIDATE_Y2KBUG (MM, DD, YY)
</pre>

<p>(Note that the <code>EXTERNAL</code> statement
is not actually required,
since the modified names are not recognized as intrinsics
by the current version of <code>g77</code>. 
But it is shown in this specific case,
for purposes of illustration.)

<p>The renaming of <code>EXTERNAL</code> procedure names of these intrinsics
causes unresolved references at link time. 
For example, <code>EXTERNAL DATE; CALL DATE(STR)</code>
is normally compiled by <code>g77</code>
as, in C, <code>date_(&amp;str, 20);</code>. 
This, in turn, links to the <code>date_</code> procedure
in the <code>libE77</code> portion of <code>libg2c</code>,
which purposely calls a nonexistent procedure
named <code>G77_date_y2kbuggy_0</code>. 
The resulting link-time error is designed, via this name,
to encourage the programmer to look up the
index entries to this portion of the <code>g77</code> documentation.

<p>Generally, we recommend that the <code>EXTERNAL</code> method
of invoking procedures in <code>libg2c</code>
<em>not</em> be used. 
When used, some of the correctness checking
normally performed by <code>g77</code>
is skipped.

<p>In particular, it is probably better to use the
<code>INTRINSIC</code> method of invoking
non-Y2K-compliant procedures,
so anyone compiling the code
can quickly notice the potential Y2K problems
(via the warnings printing by <code>g77</code>)
without having to even look at the code itself.

<p>If there are problems linking <code>libg2c</code>
to code compiled by <code>g77</code>
that involve the string <code>y2kbug</code>,
and these are not explained above,
that probably indicates
that a version of <code>libg2c</code>
older than <code>g77</code>
is being linked to,
or that the new library is being linked
to code compiled by an older version of <code>g77</code>.

<p>That's because, as of the version that warns about
non-Y2K-compliant intrinsic invocation,
<code>g77</code> references the <code>libg2c</code> implementations
of those intrinsics
using new names, containing the string <code>y2kbug</code>.

<p>So, linking newly-compiled code
(invoking one of the intrinsics in question)
to an old library
might yield an unresolved reference
to <code>G77_date_y2kbug_0</code>. 
(The old library calls it <code>G77_date_0</code>.)

<p>Similarly, linking previously-compiled code
to a new library
might yield an unresolved reference
to <code>G77_vxtidate_0</code>. 
(The new library calls it <code>G77_vxtidate_y2kbug_0</code>.)

<p>The proper fix for the above problems
is to obtain the latest release of <code>g77</code>
and related products
(including <code>libg2c</code>)
and install them on all systems,
then recompile, relink, and install
(as appropriate)
all existing Fortran programs.

<p>(Normally, this sort of renaming is steadfastly avoided. 
In this case, however, it seems more important to highlight
potential Y2K problems
than to ease the transition
of potentially non-Y2K-compliant code
to new versions of <code>g77</code> and <code>libg2c</code>.)

<h3>Array Size</h3>

<p>Currently, <code>g77</code> uses the default <code>INTEGER</code> type
for array indexes,
which limits the sizes of single-dimension arrays
on systems offering a larger address space
than can be addressed by that type. 
(That <code>g77</code> puts all arrays in memory
could be considered another limitation--it
could use large temporary files--but that decision
is left to the programmer as an implementation choice
by most Fortran implementations.)

<p>It is not yet clear whether this limitation
never, sometimes, or always applies to the
sizes of multiple-dimension arrays as a whole.

<p>For example, on a system with 64-bit addresses
and 32-bit default <code>INTEGER</code>,
an array with a size greater than can be addressed
by a 32-bit offset
can be declared using multiple dimensions. 
Such an array is therefore larger
than a single-dimension array can be,
on the same system.

<p>Whether large multiple-dimension arrays are reliably supported
depends mostly on the <code>gcc</code> back end (code generator)
used by <code>g77</code>, and has not yet been fully investigated.

<h3>Character-variable Length</h3>

<p>Currently, <code>g77</code> uses the default <code>INTEGER</code> type
for the lengths of <code>CHARACTER</code> variables
and array elements.

<p>This means that, for example,
a system with a 64-bit address space
and a 32-bit default <code>INTEGER</code> type
does not, under <code>g77</code>,
support a <code>CHARACTER*<var>n</var></code> declaration
where <var>n</var> is greater than 2147483647.

<h3>Year 10000 (Y10K) Problems</h3>

<p>Most intrinsics returning, or computing values based on,
date information are prone to Year-10000 (Y10K) problems,
due to supporting only 4 digits for the year.

<h2>Compiler Types</h2>

<p>Fortran implementations have a fair amount of freedom given them by the
standard as far as how much storage space is used and how much precision
and range is offered by the various types such as <code>LOGICAL(KIND=1)</code>,
<code>INTEGER(KIND=1)</code>, <code>REAL(KIND=1)</code>, <code>REAL(KIND=2)</code>,
<code>COMPLEX(KIND=1)</code>, and <code>CHARACTER</code>. 
Further, many compilers offer so-called <code>*<var>n</var></code> notation, but
the interpretation of <var>n</var> varies across compilers and target architectures.

<p>The standard requires that <code>LOGICAL(KIND=1)</code>, <code>INTEGER(KIND=1)</code>,
and <code>REAL(KIND=1)</code>
occupy the same amount of storage space, and that <code>COMPLEX(KIND=1)</code>
and <code>REAL(KIND=2)</code> take twice as much storage space as <code>REAL(KIND=1)</code>. 
Further, it requires that <code>COMPLEX(KIND=1)</code>
entities be ordered such that when a <code>COMPLEX(KIND=1)</code> variable is
storage-associated (such as via <code>EQUIVALENCE</code>)
with a two-element <code>REAL(KIND=1)</code> array named <code>R</code>, <code>R(1)</code>
corresponds to the real element and <code>R(2)</code> to the imaginary
element of the <code>COMPLEX(KIND=1)</code> variable.

<p>(Few requirements as to precision or ranges of any of these are
placed on the implementation, nor is the relationship of storage sizes of
these types to the <code>CHARACTER</code> type specified, by the standard.)

<p><code>g77</code> follows the above requirements, warning when compiling
a program requires placement of items in memory that contradict the
requirements of the target architecture. 
(For example, a program can require placement of a <code>REAL(KIND=2)</code>
on a boundary that is not an even multiple of its size, but still an
even multiple of the size of a <code>REAL(KIND=1)</code> variable. 
On some target architectures, using the canonical
mapping of Fortran types to underlying architectural types, such
placement is prohibited by the machine definition or
the Application Binary Interface (ABI) in force for
the configuration defined for building <code>gcc</code> and <code>g77</code>. 
<code>g77</code> warns about such
situations when it encounters them.)

<p><code>g77</code> follows consistent rules for configuring the mapping between Fortran
types, including the <code>*<var>n</var></code> notation, and the underlying architectural
types as accessed by a similarly-configured applicable version of the
<code>gcc</code> compiler. 
These rules offer a widely portable, consistent Fortran/C
environment, although they might well conflict with the expectations of
users of Fortran compilers designed and written for particular
architectures.

<p>These rules are based on the configuration that is in force for the
version of <code>gcc</code> built in the same release as <code>g77</code> (and
which was therefore used to build both the <code>g77</code> compiler
components and the <code>libg2c</code> run-time library):

<dl>
<dt><code>REAL(KIND=1)</code>
<dd>Same as <code>float</code> type.

<br><dt><code>REAL(KIND=2)</code>
<dd>Same as whatever floating-point type that is twice the size
of a <code>float</code>--usually, this is a <code>double</code>.

<br><dt><code>INTEGER(KIND=1)</code>
<dd>Same as an integral type that is occupies the same amount
of memory storage as <code>float</code>--usually, this is either
an <code>int</code> or a <code>long int</code>.

<br><dt><code>LOGICAL(KIND=1)</code>
<dd>Same <code>gcc</code> type as <code>INTEGER(KIND=1)</code>.

<br><dt><code>INTEGER(KIND=2)</code>
<dd>Twice the size, and usually nearly twice the range,
as <code>INTEGER(KIND=1)</code>--usually, this is either
a <code>long int</code> or a <code>long long int</code>.

<br><dt><code>LOGICAL(KIND=2)</code>
<dd>Same <code>gcc</code> type as <code>INTEGER(KIND=2)</code>.

<br><dt><code>INTEGER(KIND=3)</code>
<dd>Same <code>gcc</code> type as signed <code>char</code>.

<br><dt><code>LOGICAL(KIND=3)</code>
<dd>Same <code>gcc</code> type as <code>INTEGER(KIND=3)</code>.

<br><dt><code>INTEGER(KIND=6)</code>
<dd>Twice the size, and usually nearly twice the range,
as <code>INTEGER(KIND=3)</code>--usually, this is
a <code>short</code>.

<br><dt><code>LOGICAL(KIND=6)</code>
<dd>Same <code>gcc</code> type as <code>INTEGER(KIND=6)</code>.

<br><dt><code>COMPLEX(KIND=1)</code>
<dd>Two <code>REAL(KIND=1)</code> scalars (one for the real part followed by
one for the imaginary part).

<br><dt><code>COMPLEX(KIND=2)</code>
<dd>Two <code>REAL(KIND=2)</code> scalars.

<br><dt><code><var>numeric-type</var>*<var>n</var></code>
<dd>(Where <var>numeric-type</var> is any type other than <code>CHARACTER</code>.) 
Same as whatever <code>gcc</code> type occupies <var>n</var> times the storage
space of a <code>gcc</code> <code>char</code> item.

<br><dt><code>DOUBLE PRECISION</code>
<dd>Same as <code>REAL(KIND=2)</code>.

<br><dt><code>DOUBLE COMPLEX</code>
<dd>Same as <code>COMPLEX(KIND=2)</code>. 
</dl>

<p>Note that the above are proposed correspondences and might change
in future versions of <code>g77</code>--avoid writing code depending
on them.

<p>Other types supported by <code>g77</code>
are derived from gcc types such as <code>char</code>, <code>short</code>,
<code>int</code>, <code>long int</code>, <code>long long int</code>, <code>long double</code>,
and so on. 
That is, whatever types <code>gcc</code> already supports, <code>g77</code> supports
now or probably will support in a future version. 
The rules for the <code><var>numeric-type</var>*<var>n</var></code> notation
apply to these types,
and new values for <code><var>numeric-type</var>(KIND=<var>n</var>)</code> will be
assigned in a way that encourages clarity, consistency, and portability.

<h2>Compiler Constants</h2>

<p><code>g77</code> strictly assigns types to <em>all</em> constants not
documented as "typeless" (typeless constants including <code>'1'Z</code>,
for example). 
Many other Fortran compilers attempt to assign types to typed constants
based on their context. 
This results in hard-to-find bugs, nonportable
code, and is not in the spirit (though it strictly follows the letter)
of the 77 and 90 standards.

<p><code>g77</code> might offer, in a future release, explicit constructs by
which a wider variety of typeless constants may be specified, and/or
user-requested warnings indicating places where <code>g77</code> might differ
from how other compilers assign types to constants.

<br>

<h2>Compiler Intrinsics</h2>

<p><code>g77</code> offers an ever-widening set of intrinsics. 
Currently these all are procedures (functions and subroutines).

<p>Some of these intrinsics are unimplemented, but their names reserved
to reduce future problems with existing code as they are implemented. 
Others are implemented as part of the GNU Fortran language, while
yet others are provided for compatibility with other dialects of
Fortran but are not part of the GNU Fortran language.

<p>To manage these distinctions, <code>g77</code> provides intrinsic <em>groups</em>,
a facility that is simply an extension of the intrinsic groups provided
by the GNU Fortran language.

<ul>
<li><a href="#Intrinsic%20Groups">Intrinsic Groups</a>:   How intrinsics are grouped for easy management. 
<li><a href="#Other%20Intrinsics">Other Intrinsics</a>:   Intrinsics other than those in the GNU
                       Fortran language. 
</ul>

<p><hr>
Node:<a name="Intrinsic%20Groups">Intrinsic Groups</a>,
Next:<a rel=next href="#Other%20Intrinsics">Other Intrinsics</a>,
Up:<a rel=up href="#Compiler%20Intrinsics">Compiler Intrinsics</a>
<br>

<h3>Intrinsic Groups</h3>

<p>A given specific intrinsic belongs in one or more groups. 
Each group is deleted, disabled, hidden, or enabled
by default or a command-line option. 
The meaning of each term follows.

<dl>
<dt><b>Deleted</b>
<dd>No intrinsics are recognized as belonging to that group.

<br><dt><b>Disabled</b>
<dd>Intrinsics are recognized as belonging to the group, but
references to them (other than via the <code>INTRINSIC</code> statement)
are disallowed through that group.

<br><dt><b>Hidden</b>
<dd>Intrinsics in that group are recognized and enabled (if implemented)
<em>only</em> if the first mention of the actual name of an intrinsic
in a program unit is in an <code>INTRINSIC</code> statement.

<br><dt><b>Enabled</b>
<dd>Intrinsics in that group are recognized and enabled (if implemented). 
</dl>

<p>The distinction between deleting and disabling a group is illustrated
by the following example. 
Assume intrinsic <code>FOO</code> belongs only to group <code>FGR</code>. 
If group <code>FGR</code> is deleted, the following program unit will
successfully compile, because <code>FOO()</code> will be seen as a
reference to an external function named <code>FOO</code>:

<pre>PRINT *, FOO()
END
</pre>

<p>If group <code>FGR</code> is disabled, compiling the above program will produce
diagnostics, either because the <code>FOO</code> intrinsic is improperly invoked
or, if properly invoked, it is not enabled. 
To change the above program so it references an external function <code>FOO</code>
instead of the disabled <code>FOO</code> intrinsic,
add the following line to the top:

<pre>EXTERNAL FOO
</pre>

<p>So, deleting a group tells <code>g77</code> to pretend as though the intrinsics in
that group do not exist at all, whereas disabling it tells <code>g77</code> to
recognize them as (disabled) intrinsics in intrinsic-like contexts.

<p>Hiding a group is like enabling it, but the intrinsic must be first
named in an <code>INTRINSIC</code> statement to be considered a reference to the
intrinsic rather than to an external procedure. 
This might be the "safest" way to treat a new group of intrinsics
when compiling old
code, because it allows the old code to be generally written as if
those new intrinsics never existed, but to be changed to use them
by inserting <code>INTRINSIC</code> statements in the appropriate places. 
However, it should be the goal of development to use <code>EXTERNAL</code>
for all names of external procedures that might be intrinsic names.

<p>If an intrinsic is in more than one group, it is enabled if any of its
containing groups are enabled; if not so enabled, it is hidden if
any of its containing groups are hidden; if not so hidden, it is disabled
if any of its containing groups are disabled; if not so disabled, it is
deleted. 
This extra complication is necessary because some intrinsics,
such as <code>IBITS</code>, belong to more than one group, and hence should be
enabled if any of the groups to which they belong are enabled, and so
on.

<p>The groups are:

<dl>
<dt><code>badu77</code>
<dd>UNIX intrinsics having inappropriate forms (usually functions that
have intended side effects).

<br><dt><code>gnu</code>
<dd>Intrinsics the GNU Fortran language supports that are extensions to
the Fortran standards (77 and 90).

<br><dt><code>f2c</code>
<dd>Intrinsics supported by AT&amp;T's <code>f2c</code> converter and/or <code>libf2c</code>.

<br><dt><code>f90</code>
<dd>Fortran 90 intrinsics.

<br><dt><code>mil</code>
<dd>MIL-STD 1753 intrinsics (<code>MVBITS</code>, <code>IAND</code>, <code>BTEST</code>, and so on).

<br><dt><code>unix</code>
<dd>UNIX intrinsics (<code>IARGC</code>, <code>EXIT</code>, <code>ERF</code>, and so on).

<br><dt><code>vxt</code>
<dd>VAX/VMS FORTRAN (current as of v4) intrinsics.

Returns 0 on success or a non-zero error code. 
See <code>chdir(3)</code>.

<p><em>Caution:</em> Using this routine during I/O to a unit connected with a
non-absolute file name can cause subsequent I/O on such a unit to fail
because the I/O library might reopen files by name.

<p>Due to the side effects performed by this intrinsic, the function
form is not recommended.

<p><var>Mode</var>: <code>CHARACTER</code>; scalar; INTENT(IN).

<p>Intrinsic groups: <code>badu77</code>.

<p>Description:

<p>Changes the access mode of file <var>Name</var> according to the
specification <var>Mode</var>, which is given in the format of
<code>chmod(1)</code>. 
A null character (<code>CHAR(0)</code>) marks the end of
the name in <var>Name</var>--otherwise,
trailing blanks in <var>Name</var> are ignored. 
Currently, <var>Name</var> must not contain the single quote
character.

<p>Returns 0 on success or a non-zero error code otherwise.

<p>Note that this currently works
by actually invoking <code>/bin/chmod</code> (or the <code>chmod</code> found when
the library was configured) and so might fail in some circumstances and
will, anyway, be slow.

<p>Due to the side effects performed by this intrinsic, the function
form is not recommended.

<p><var>Date</var>: <code>CHARACTER</code>; scalar; INTENT(OUT).

<p>Intrinsic groups: <code>vxt</code>.

<p>Description:

<p>Returns <var>Date</var> in the form <code><var>dd</var>-<var>mmm</var>-<var>yy</var></code>,
representing the numeric day of the month <var>dd</var>, a three-character
abbreviation of the month name <var>mmm</var> and the last two digits of
the year <var>yy</var>, e.g. <code>25-Nov-96</code>.

<p>This intrinsic is not recommended, due to the year 2000 approaching. 
Therefore, programs making use of this intrinsic
might not be Year 2000 (Y2K) compliant. 
See <a href="#CTime%20Intrinsic%20(subroutine)">CTime Intrinsic (subroutine)</a>, for information on obtaining more digits
for the current (or any) date.

<h4>DCmplx Intrinsic</h4>

<pre>DCmplx(<var>X</var>, <var>Y</var>)
</pre>

<p>DCmplx: <code>COMPLEX(KIND=2)</code> function.

<p><var>X</var>: <code>INTEGER</code>, <code>REAL</code>, or <code>COMPLEX</code>; scalar; INTENT(IN).

<p><var>Y</var>: <code>INTEGER</code> or <code>REAL</code>; OPTIONAL (must be omitted if <var>X</var> is <code>COMPLEX</code>); scalar; INTENT(IN).

<p>Intrinsic groups: <code>f2c</code>, <code>vxt</code>.

<p>Description:

<p>If <var>X</var> is not type <code>COMPLEX</code>,
constructs a value of type <code>COMPLEX(KIND=2)</code> from the
real and imaginary values specified by <var>X</var> and
<var>Y</var>, respectively. 
If <var>Y</var> is omitted, <code>0D0</code> is assumed.

<p>If <var>X</var> is type <code>COMPLEX</code>,
converts it to type <code>COMPLEX(KIND=2)</code>.

<p>Although this intrinsic is not standard Fortran,
it is a popular extension offered by many compilers
that support <code>DOUBLE COMPLEX</code>, since it offers
the easiest way to convert to <code>DOUBLE COMPLEX</code>
without using Fortran 90 features (such as the <code>KIND=</code>
argument to the <code>CMPLX()</code> intrinsic).

<p>(<code>CMPLX(0D0, 0D0)</code> returns a single-precision
<code>COMPLEX</code> result, as required by standard FORTRAN 77. 
That's why so many compilers provide <code>DCMPLX()</code>, since
<code>DCMPLX(0D0, 0D0)</code> returns a <code>DOUBLE COMPLEX</code>
result. 
Still, <code>DCMPLX()</code> converts even <code>REAL*16</code> arguments
to their <code>REAL*8</code> equivalents in most dialects of
Fortran, so neither it nor <code>CMPLX()</code> allow easy
construction of arbitrary-precision values without
potentially forcing a conversion involving extending or
reducing precision. 
GNU Fortran provides such an intrinsic, called <code>COMPLEX()</code>.)

<p>See <a href="#Complex%20Intrinsic">Complex Intrinsic</a>, for information on easily constructing
a <code>COMPLEX</code> value of arbitrary precision from <code>REAL</code>
arguments.

<p>Description:

<p>Initially, return the number of seconds of runtime
since the start of the process's execution
as the function value,
and the user and system components of this in <code><var>TArray</var>(1)</code>
and <code><var>TArray</var>(2)</code> respectively. 
The functions' value is equal to <code><var>TArray</var>(1) + <var>TArray</var>(2)</code>.

<p>Subsequent invocations of <code>DTIME()</code> return values accumulated since the
previous invocation.

<p>On some systems, the underlying timings are represented
using types with sufficiently small limits that overflows
(wraparounds) are possible, such as 32-bit types. 
Therefore, the values returned by this intrinsic
might be, or become, negative,
or numerically less than previous values,
during a single run of the compiled program.

<p>Due to the side effects performed by this intrinsic, the function
form is not recommended.

<h4>Signal Intrinsic (function)</h4>

<pre>Signal(<var>Number</var>, <var>Handler</var>)
</pre>

<p>Signal: <code>INTEGER(KIND=7)</code> function.

<p><var>Number</var>: <code>INTEGER</code>; scalar; INTENT(IN).

<p><var>Handler</var>: Signal handler (<code>INTEGER FUNCTION</code> or <code>SUBROUTINE</code>)
or dummy/global <code>INTEGER(KIND=1)</code> scalar.

<p>Intrinsic groups: <code>badu77</code>.

<p>Description:

<p>If <var>Handler</var> is a an <code>EXTERNAL</code> routine, arranges for it to be
invoked with a single integer argument (of system-dependent length)
when signal <var>Number</var> occurs. 
If <var>Handler</var> is an integer, it can be
used to turn off handling of signal <var>Number</var> or revert to its default
action. 
See <code>signal(2)</code>.

<p>Note that <var>Handler</var> will be called using C conventions,
so the value of its argument in Fortran terms
is obtained by applying <code>%LOC()</code> (or <var>LOC()</var>) to it.

<p>The value returned by <code>signal(2)</code> is returned.

<p>Due to the side effects performed by this intrinsic, the function
form is not recommended.

<p><em>Warning:</em> If the returned value is stored in
an <code>INTEGER(KIND=1)</code> (default <code>INTEGER</code>) argument,
truncation of the original return value occurs on some systems
(such as Alphas, which have 64-bit pointers but 32-bit default integers),
with no warning issued by <code>g77</code> under normal circumstances.

<p>Therefore, the following code fragment might silently fail on
some systems:

<pre>INTEGER RTN
EXTERNAL MYHNDL
RTN = SIGNAL(<var>signum</var>, MYHNDL)
<small>...</small>
! Restore original handler:
RTN = SIGNAL(<var>signum</var>, RTN)
</pre>

<p>The reason for the failure is that <code>RTN</code> might not hold
all the information on the original handler for the signal,
thus restoring an invalid handler. 
This bug could manifest itself as a spurious run-time failure
at an arbitrary point later during the program's execution,
for example.

<p><em>Warning:</em> Use of the <code>libf2c</code> run-time library function
<code>signal_</code> directly
(such as via <code>EXTERNAL SIGNAL</code>)
requires use of the <code>%VAL()</code> construct
to pass an <code>INTEGER</code> value
(such as <code>SIG_IGN</code> or <code>SIG_DFL</code>)
for the <var>Handler</var> argument.

<p>However, while <code>RTN = SIGNAL(<var>signum</var>, %VAL(SIG_IGN))</code>
works when <code>SIGNAL</code> is treated as an external procedure
(and resolves, at link time, to <code>libf2c</code>'s <code>signal_</code> routine),
this construct is not valid when <code>SIGNAL</code> is recognized
as the intrinsic of that name.

<p>Therefore, for maximum portability and reliability,
code such references to the <code>SIGNAL</code> facility as follows:

<pre>INTRINSIC SIGNAL
<small>...</small>
RTN = SIGNAL(<var>signum</var>, SIG_IGN)
</pre>

<p><code>g77</code> will compile such a call correctly,
while other compilers will generally either do so as well
or reject the <code>INTRINSIC SIGNAL</code> statement via a diagnostic,
allowing you to take appropriate action.

<h4>System Intrinsic (function)</h4>

<pre>System(<var>Command</var>)

<p>System: <code>INTEGER(KIND=1)</code> function.

<p><var>Command</var>: <code>CHARACTER</code>; scalar; INTENT(IN).

<p>Intrinsic groups: <code>badu77</code>.

<p>Description:

<p>Passes the command <var>Command</var> to a shell (see <code>system(3)</code>). 
Returns the value returned by
<code>system(3)</code>, presumably 0 if the shell command succeeded. 
Note that which shell is used to invoke the command is system-dependent
and environment-dependent.

<p>Due to the side effects performed by this intrinsic, the function
form is not recommended. 
However, the function form can be valid in cases where the
actual side effects performed by the call are unimportant to
the application.

<p>For example, on a UNIX system, <code>SAME = SYSTEM('cmp a b')</code>
does not perform any side effects likely to be important to the
program, so the programmer would not care if the actual system
call (and invocation of <code>cmp</code>) was optimized away in a situation
where the return value could be determined otherwise, or was not
actually needed (<code>SAME</code> not actually referenced after the
sample assignment statement).

<h1>Other Compilers</h1>

<p>An individual Fortran source file can be compiled to
an object (<code>*.o</code>) file instead of to the final
program executable. 
This allows several portions of a program to be compiled
at different times and linked together whenever a new
version of the program is needed. 
However, it introduces the issue of <dfn>object compatibility</dfn>
across the various object files (and libraries, or <code>*.a</code>
files) that are linked together to produce any particular
executable file.

<p>Object compatibility is an issue when combining, in one
program, Fortran code compiled by more than one compiler
(or more than one configuration of a compiler). 
If the compilers
disagree on how to transform the names of procedures, there
will normally be errors when linking such programs. 
Worse, if the compilers agree on naming, but disagree on issues
like how to pass parameters, return arguments, and lay out
<code>COMMON</code> areas, the earliest detected errors might be the
incorrect results produced by the program (and that assumes
these errors are detected, which is not always the case).

<p>Normally, <code>g77</code> generates code that is
object-compatible with code generated by a version of
<code>f2c</code> configured (with, for example, <code>f2c.h</code> definitions)
to be generally compatible with <code>g77</code> as built by <code>gcc</code>. 
(Normally, <code>f2c</code> will, by default, conform to the appropriate
configuration, but it is possible that older or perhaps even newer
versions of <code>f2c</code>, or versions having certain configuration changes
to <code>f2c</code> internals, will produce object files that are
incompatible with <code>g77</code>.)

<p>For example, a Fortran string subroutine
argument will become two arguments on the C side: a <code>char *</code>
and an <code>int</code> length.

<p>Much of this compatibility results from the fact that
<code>g77</code> uses the same run-time library,
<code>libf2c</code>, used by <code>f2c</code>,
though <code>g77</code> gives its version the name <code>libg2c</code>
so as to avoid conflicts when linking,
installing them in the same directories,
and so on.

<p>Other compilers might or might not generate code that
is object-compatible with <code>libg2c</code> and current <code>g77</code>,
and some might offer such compatibility only when explicitly
selected via a command-line option to the compiler.

of work!</em>

<h2>Dropping <code>f2c</code> Compatibility</h2>

<p>Specifying <code>-fno-f2c</code> allows <code>g77</code> to generate, in
some cases, faster code, by not needing to allow to the possibility
of linking with code compiled by <code>f2c</code>.

<p>For example, this affects how <code>REAL(KIND=1)</code>,
<code>COMPLEX(KIND=1)</code>, and <code>COMPLEX(KIND=2)</code> functions are called. 
With <code>-fno-f2c</code>, they are
compiled as returning the appropriate <code>gcc</code> type
(<code>float</code>, <code>__complex__ float</code>, <code>__complex__ double</code>,
in many configurations).

<p>With <code>-ff2c</code> in force, they
are compiled differently (with perhaps slower run-time performance)
to accommodate the restrictions inherent in <code>f2c</code>'s use of K&amp;R
C as an intermediate language--<code>REAL(KIND=1)</code> functions
return C's <code>double</code> type, while <code>COMPLEX</code> functions return
<code>void</code> and use an extra argument pointing to a place for the functions to
return their values.

<p>It is possible that, in some cases, leaving <code>-ff2c</code> in force
might produce faster code than using <code>-fno-f2c</code>. 
Feel free to experiment, but remember to experiment with changing the way
<em>entire programs and their Fortran libraries are compiled</em> at
a time, since this sort of experimentation affects the interface
of code generated for a Fortran source file--that is, it affects
object compatibility.

<p>Note that <code>f2c</code> compatibility is a fairly static target to achieve,
though not necessarily perfectly so, since, like <code>g77</code>, it is
still being improved. 
However, specifying <code>-fno-f2c</code> causes <code>g77</code>
to generate code that will probably be incompatible with code
generated by future versions of <code>g77</code> when the same option
is in force. 
You should make sure you are always able to recompile complete
programs from source code when upgrading to new versions of <code>g77</code>
or <code>f2c</code>, especially when using options such as <code>-fno-f2c</code>.

<p>Therefore, if you are using <code>g77</code> to compile libraries and other
object files for possible future use and you don't want to require
recompilation for future use with subsequent versions of <code>g77</code>,
you might want to stick with <code>f2c</code> compatibility for now, and
carefully watch for any announcements about changes to the
<code>f2c</code>/<code>libf2c</code> interface that might affect existing programs
(thus requiring recompilation).

<p>It is probable that a future version of <code>g77</code> will not,
by default, generate object files compatible with <code>f2c</code>,
and that version probably would no longer use <code>libf2c</code>. 
If you expect to depend on this compatibility in the
long term, use the options <code>-ff2c -ff2c-library</code> when compiling
all of the applicable code. 
This should cause future versions of <code>g77</code> either to produce
compatible code (at the expense of the availability of some features and
performance), or at the very least, to produce diagnostics.

<p>(The library <code>g77</code> produces will no longer be named <code>libg2c</code>
when it is no longer generally compatible with <code>libf2c</code>. 
It will likely be referred to, and, if installed as a distinct
library, named <code>libg77</code>, or some other as-yet-unused name.)

<h2>Compilers Other Than <code>f2c</code></h2>

<p>On systems with Fortran compilers other than <code>f2c</code> and <code>g77</code>,
code compiled by <code>g77</code> is not expected to work
well with code compiled by the native compiler. 
(This is true for <code>f2c</code>-compiled objects as well.) 
Libraries compiled with the native compiler probably will have
to be recompiled with <code>g77</code> to be used with <code>g77</code>-compiled code.

<p>Reasons for such incompatibilities include:

<ul>
<li>There might be differences in the way names of Fortran procedures
are translated for use in the system's object-file format. 
For example, the statement <code>CALL FOO</code> might be compiled
by <code>g77</code> to call a procedure the linker <code>ld</code> sees
given the name <code>_foo_</code>, while the apparently corresponding
statement <code>SUBROUTINE FOO</code> might be compiled by the
native compiler to define the linker-visible name <code>_foo</code>,
or <code>_FOO_</code>, and so on.

<li>There might be subtle type mismatches which cause subroutine arguments
and function return values to get corrupted.

<p>This is why simply getting <code>g77</code> to
transform procedure names the same way a native
compiler does is not usually a good idea--unless
some effort has been made to ensure that, aside
from the way the two compilers transform procedure
names, everything else about the way they generate
code for procedure interfaces is identical.

</p><li>Native compilers
use libraries of private I/O routines which will not be available
at link time unless you have the native compiler--and you would
have to explicitly ask for them.

<p>For example, on the Sun you
would have to add <code>-L/usr/lang/SCx.x -lF77 -lV77</code> to the link
command.

<h2>Tools and advice for interoperating with C and C++</h2>

<p>The following discussion assumes that you are running <code>g77</code> in <code>f2c</code>
compatibility mode, i.e. not using <code>-fno-f2c</code>. 
It provides some
advice about quick and simple techniques for linking Fortran and C (or
C++), the most common requirement. 
For the full story consult the
description of code generation. 
See <a href="#Debugging%20and%20Interfacing">Debugging and Interfacing</a>.

<p>When linking Fortran and C, it's usually best to use <code>g77</code> to do
the linking so that the correct libraries are included (including the
maths one). 
If you're linking with C++ you will want to add
<code>-lstdc++</code>, <code>-lg++</code> or whatever. 
If you need to use another
driver program (or <code>ld</code> directly),
you can find out what linkage
options <code>g77</code> passes by running <code>g77 -v</code>.

<h3>C Interfacing Tools</h3>

<p>Even if you don't actually use it as a compiler, <code>f2c</code> from
<a href="ftp://ftp.netlib.org/f2c/src">ftp://ftp.netlib.org/f2c/src</a>, can be a useful tool when you're
interfacing (linking) Fortran and C. 
See <a href="#f2c%20Skeletons%20and%20Prototypes">Generating Skeletons and Prototypes with <code>f2c</code></a>.

<p>To use <code>f2c</code> for this purpose you only need retrieve and
build the <code>src</code> directory from the distribution, consult the
<code>README</code> instructions there for machine-specifics, and install the
<code>f2c</code> program on your path.

<p>Something else that might be useful is <code>cfortran.h</code> from
<a href="ftp://zebra/desy.de/cfortran">ftp://zebra/desy.de/cfortran</a>. 
This is a fairly general tool which
can be used to generate interfaces for calling in both directions
between Fortran and C. 
It can be used in <code>f2c</code> mode with
<code>g77</code>--consult its documentation for details.

<h3>Accessing Type Information in C</h3>

<p>Generally, C code written to link with
<code>g77</code> code--calling and/or being
called from Fortran--should <code>#include &lt;g2c.h&gt;</code> to define the C
versions of the Fortran types. 
Don't assume Fortran <code>INTEGER</code> types
correspond to C <code>int</code>s, for instance; instead, declare them as
<code>integer</code>, a type defined by <code>g2c.h</code>. 
<code>g2c.h</code> is installed where <code>gcc</code> will find it by
default, assuming you use a copy of <code>gcc</code> compatible with
<code>g77</code>, probably built at the same time as <code>g77</code>.

<h3>Generating Skeletons and Prototypes with <code>f2c</code></h3>

<p>A simple and foolproof way to write <code>g77</code>-callable C routines--e.g. to
interface with an existing library--is to write a file (named, for
example, <code>fred.f</code>) of dummy Fortran
skeletons comprising just the declaration of the routine(s) and dummy
arguments plus <code>END</code> statements. 
Then run <code>f2c</code> on file <code>fred.f</code> to produce <code>fred.c</code>
into which you can edit
useful code, confident the calling sequence is correct, at least. 
(There are some errors otherwise commonly made in generating C
interfaces with <code>f2c</code> conventions,
such as not using <code>doublereal</code>
as the return type of a <code>REAL</code> <code>FUNCTION</code>.)

<p><code>f2c</code> also can help with calling Fortran from C, using its
<code>-P</code> option to generate C prototypes appropriate for calling the
Fortran.<a rel=footnote href="#fn-2"><sup>2</sup></a>
If the Fortran code containing any
routines to be called from C is in file <code>joe.f</code>, use the command
<kbd>f2c -P joe.f</kbd> to generate the file <code>joe.P</code> containing
prototype information. 
<code>#include</code> this in the C which has to call
the Fortran routines to make sure you get it right.

<p>See <a href="#Arrays">Arrays (DIMENSION)</a>, for information on the differences
between the way Fortran (including compilers like <code>g77</code>) and
C handle arrays.

<h3>C++ Considerations</h3>

<p><code>f2c</code> can be used to generate suitable code for compilation with a
C++ system using the <code>-C++</code> option. 
The important thing about linking <code>g77</code>-compiled
code with C++ is that the prototypes for the <code>g77</code>
routines must specify C linkage to avoid name mangling. 
So, use an <code>extern "C"</code> declaration. 
<code>f2c</code>'s <code>-C++</code> option will take care
of this when generating skeletons or prototype files as above, and also
avoid clashes with C++ reserved words in addition to those in C.

<br>

<h3>Startup Code</h3>

<p>Unlike with some runtime systems,
it shouldn't be necessary
(unless there are bugs)
to use a Fortran main program unit to ensure the
runtime--specifically the I/O system--is initialized.

<p>However, to use the <code>g77</code> intrinsics <code>GETARG</code> and <code>IARGC</code>,
either the <code>main</code> routine from the <code>libg2c</code> library must be used,
or the <code>f_setarg</code> routine
(new as of <code>egcs</code> version 1.1 and <code>g77</code> version 0.5.23)
must be called with the appropriate <code>argc</code> and <code>argv</code> arguments
prior to the program calling <code>GETARG</code> or <code>IARGC</code>.

<p>To provide more flexibility for mixed-language programming
involving <code>g77</code> while allowing for shared libraries,
as of <code>egcs</code> version 1.1 and <code>g77</code> version 0.5.23,
<code>g77</code>'s <code>main</code> routine in <code>libg2c</code>
does the following, in order:

<ol type=1 start=1>
</p><li>Calls <code>f_setarg</code>
with the incoming <code>argc</code> and <code>argv</code> arguments,
in the same order as for <code>main</code> itself.

<p>This sets up the command-line environment
for <code>GETARG</code> and <code>IARGC</code>.

</p><li>Calls <code>f_setsig</code> (with no arguments).

<p>This sets up the signaling and exception environment.

</p><li>Calls <code>f_init</code> (with no arguments).

<p>This initializes the I/O environment,
though that should not be necessary,
as all I/O functions in <code>libf2c</code>
are believed to call <code>f_init</code> automatically,
if necessary.

<p>(A future version of <code>g77</code> might skip this explicit step,
to speed up normal exit of a program.)

</p><li>Arranges for <code>f_exit</code> to be called (with no arguments)
when the program exits.

<p>This ensures that the I/O environment is properly shut down
before the program exits normally. 
Otherwise, output buffers might not be fully flushed,
scratch files might not be deleted, and so on.

<p>The simple way <code>main</code> does this is
to call <code>f_exit</code> itself after calling
<code>MAIN__</code> (in the next step).

<p>However, this does not catch the cases where the program
might call <code>exit</code> directly,
instead of using the <code>EXIT</code> intrinsic
(implemented as <code>exit_</code> in <code>libf2c</code>).

<p>So, <code>main</code> attempts to use
the operating environment's <code>onexit</code> or <code>atexit</code>
facility, if available,
to cause <code>f_exit</code> to be called automatically
upon any invocation of <code>exit</code>.

</p><li>Calls <code>MAIN__</code> (with no arguments).

<p>This starts executing the Fortran main program unit for
the application. 
(Both <code>g77</code> and <code>f2c</code> currently compile a main
program unit so that its global name is <code>MAIN__</code>.)

</p><li>If no <code>onexit</code> or <code>atexit</code> is provided by the system,
calls <code>f_exit</code>.

<li>Calls <code>exit</code> with a zero argument,
to signal a successful program termination.

<li>Returns a zero value to the caller,
to signal a successful program termination,
in case <code>exit</code> doesn't exit on the system.
</ol>

<p>All of the above names are C <code>extern</code> names,
i.e. not mangled.

<p>When using the <code>main</code> procedure provided by <code>g77</code>
without a Fortran main program unit,
you need to provide <code>MAIN__</code>
as the entry point for your C code. 
(Make sure you link the object file that defines that
entry point with the rest of your program.)

<p>To provide your own <code>main</code> procedure
in place of <code>g77</code>'s,
make sure you specify the object file defining that procedure
<em>before</em> <code>-lg2c</code> on the <code>g77</code> command line. 
Since the <code>-lg2c</code> option is implicitly provided,
this is usually straightforward. 
(Use the <code>--verbose</code> option to see how and where
<code>g77</code> implicitly adds <code>-lg2c</code> in a command line
that will link the program. 
Feel free to specify <code>-lg2c</code> explicitly,
as appropriate.)

<p>However, when providing your own <code>main</code>,
make sure you perform the appropriate tasks in the
appropriate order. 
For example, if your <code>main</code> does not call <code>f_setarg</code>,
make sure the rest of your application does not call
<code>GETARG</code> or <code>IARGC</code>.

<p>And, if your <code>main</code> fails to ensure that <code>f_exit</code>
is called upon program exit,
some files might end up incompletely written,
some scratch files might be left lying around,
and some existing files being written might be left
with old data not properly truncated at the end.

<p>Note that, generally, the <code>g77</code> operating environment
does not depend on a procedure named <code>MAIN__</code> actually
being called prior to any other <code>g77</code>-compiled code. 
That is, <code>MAIN__</code> does not, itself,
set up any important operating-environment characteristics
upon which other code might depend. 
This might change in future versions of <code>g77</code>,
with appropriate notification in the release notes.

<p>For more information, consult the source code for the above routines. 
These are in <code>egcs/libf2c/libF77/</code>, named <code>main.c</code>,
<code>setarg.c</code>, <code>setsig.c</code>, <code>getarg_.c</code>, and <code>iargc_.c</code>.

<p>Also, the file <code>egcs/gcc/f/com.c</code> contains the code <code>g77</code>
uses to open-code (inline) references to <code>IARGC</code>.

<h4>GNU C Required</h4>

<p>Compiling <code>g77</code> requires GNU C, not just ANSI C. 
Fixing this wouldn't
be very hard (just tedious), but the code using GNU extensions to
the C language is expected to be rewritten for 0.6 anyway,
so there are no plans for an interim fix.

<p>This requirement does not mean you must already have <code>gcc</code>
installed to build <code>g77</code>. 
As long as you have a working C compiler, you can use a
"bootstrap" build to automate the process of first building
<code>gcc</code> using the working C compiler you have, then building
<code>g77</code> and rebuilding <code>gcc</code> using that just-built <code>gcc</code>,
and so on.

<h4>Patching GNU CC</h4>

<p><code>g77</code> no longer requires application of a patch file

<h4>Cleanup Kills Stage Directories</h4>

<p>It'd be helpful if <code>g77</code>'s <code>Makefile.in</code> or <code>Make-lang.in</code>
would create the various <code>stage<var>n</var></code> directories and their
subdirectories, so developers and expert installers wouldn't have to
reconfigure after cleaning up.

<p>That help has arrived as of version 0.5.23 of <code>g77</code>
and version 1.1 of <code>egcs</code>. 
Configuration itself no longer creates any particular directories
that are unique to <code>g77</code>. 
The build procedures in <code>Make-lang.in</code> take care of
that, on demand.

<h4>LANGUAGES Macro Ignored</h4>

<p>Prior to version 0.5.23 of <code>g77</code>
and version 1.1 of <code>egcs</code>,
<code>g77</code> would sometimes ignore
the absence of <code>f77</code> and <code>F77</code> in the
<code>LANGUAGES</code> macro definition used for the
<code>make</code> command being processed.

<p>As of <code>g77</code> version 0.5.23
and <code>egcs</code> version 1.1,
<code>g77</code> now obeys this macro
in all relevant situations.

<p>However, in versions of <code>gcc</code> through 2.8.1,
non-<code>g77</code> portions of <code>gcc</code>,
such as <code>g++</code>,
are known to go ahead and perform various
language-specific activities when their
respective language strings do not appear
in the <code>LANGUAGES</code> macro in effect
during that invocation of <code>make</code>.

<p>It is expected that these remaining problems will
be fixed in a future version of <code>gcc</code>.

<h3>System-specific Problems</h3>

<h3>Cross-compiler Problems</h3>

<p><code>g77</code> has been in alpha testing since September of
1992, and in public beta testing since February of 1995. 
Alpha testing was done by a small number of people worldwide on a fairly
wide variety of machines, involving self-compilation in most or
all cases. 
Beta testing has been done primarily via self-compilation,
but in more and more cases, cross-compilation (and "criss-cross
compilation", where a version of a compiler is built on one machine
to run on a second and generate code that runs on a third) has
been tried and has succeeded, to varying extents.

<p>Generally, <code>g77</code> can be ported to any configuration to which
<code>gcc</code>, <code>f2c</code>, and <code>libf2c</code> can be ported and made
to work together, aside from the known problems described in this
manual. 
If you want to port <code>g77</code> to a particular configuration,
you should first make sure <code>gcc</code> and <code>libf2c</code> can be
ported to that configuration before focusing on <code>g77</code>, because
<code>g77</code> is so dependent on them.

<p>Even for cases where <code>gcc</code> and <code>libf2c</code> work,
you might run into problems with cross-compilation on certain machines,
for several reasons.

<ul>
<li>There is one known bug
(a design bug to be fixed in 0.6) that prevents configuration of
<code>g77</code> as a cross-compiler in some cases,
though there are assumptions made during
configuration that probably make doing non-self-hosting builds
a hassle, requiring manual intervention.

<li><code>gcc</code> might still have some trouble being configured
for certain combinations of machines. 
For example, it might not know how to handle floating-point
constants.

<li>Improvements to the way <code>libg2c</code> is built could make
building <code>g77</code> as a cross-compiler easier--for example,
passing and using <code>$(LD)</code> and <code>$(AR)</code> in the appropriate
ways. 
(This is improved in the <code>egcs</code> version of <code>g77</code>,
especially as of version 1.1.)

<li>There are still some challenges putting together the right
run-time libraries (needed by <code>libg2c</code>) for a target
system, depending on the systems involved in the configuration. 
(This is a general problem with cross-compilation, and with
<code>gcc</code> in particular.)

<h2>Changing Settings Before Building</h2>

<p>Here are some internal <code>g77</code> settings that can be changed
by editing source files in <code>egcs/gcc/f/</code> before building.

<p>This information, and perhaps even these settings, represent
stop-gap solutions to problems people doing various ports
of <code>g77</code> have encountered.

<br>

<h3>Larger File Unit Numbers</h3>

<p>As distributed, whether as part of <code>f2c</code> or <code>g77</code>,
<code>libf2c</code> accepts file unit numbers only in the range
0 through 99. 
For example, a statement such as <code>WRITE (UNIT=100)</code> causes
a run-time crash in <code>libf2c</code>, because the unit number,
100, is out of range.

<p>If you know that Fortran programs at your installation require
the use of unit numbers higher than 99, you can change the
value of the <code>MXUNIT</code> macro, which represents the maximum unit
number, to an appropriately higher value.

<p>To do this, edit the file <code>egcs/libf2c/libI77/fio.h</code> in your
<code>g77</code> source tree, changing the following line:

<pre>#define MXUNIT 100
</pre>

<p>Change the line so that the value of <code>MXUNIT</code> is defined to be
at least one <em>greater</em> than the maximum unit number used by
the Fortran programs on your system.

<p>(For example, a program that does <code>WRITE (UNIT=255)</code> would require
<code>MXUNIT</code> set to at least 256 to avoid crashing.)

<p>Then build or rebuild <code>g77</code> as appropriate.

<p><em>Note:</em> Changing this macro has <em>no</em> effect on other limits
your system might place on the number of files open at the same time. 
That is, the macro might allow a program to do <code>WRITE (UNIT=100)</code>,
but the library and operating system underlying <code>libf2c</code> might
disallow it if many other files have already been opened (via <code>OPEN</code> or
implicitly via <code>READ</code>, <code>WRITE</code>, and so on). 
Information on how to increase these other limits should be found
in your system's documentation.

<br>

<h3>Always Flush Output</h3>

<p>Some Fortran programs require output
(writes) to be flushed to the operating system (under UNIX,
via the <code>fflush()</code> library call) so that errors,
such as disk full, are immediately flagged via the relevant
<code>ERR=</code> and <code>IOSTAT=</code> mechanism, instead of such
errors being flagged later as subsequent writes occur, forcing
the previously written data to disk, or when the file is
closed.

<p>Essentially, the difference can be viewed as synchronous error
reporting (immediate flagging of errors during writes) versus
asynchronous, or, more precisely, buffered error reporting
(detection of errors might be delayed).

<p><code>libg2c</code> supports flagging write errors immediately when
it is built with the <code>ALWAYS_FLUSH</code> macro defined. 
This results in a <code>libg2c</code> that runs slower, sometimes
quite a bit slower, under certain circumstances--for example,
accessing files via the networked file system NFS--but the
effect can be more reliable, robust file I/O.

<p>If you know that Fortran programs requiring this level of precision
of error reporting are to be compiled using the
version of <code>g77</code> you are building, you might wish to
modify the <code>g77</code> source tree so that the version of
<code>libg2c</code> is built with the <code>ALWAYS_FLUSH</code> macro
defined, enabling this behavior.

<p>To do this, find this line in <code>egcs/libf2c/f2c.h</code> in
your <code>g77</code> source tree:

<pre>/* #define ALWAYS_FLUSH */
</pre>

<p>Remove the leading <code>/*&nbsp;</code>,
so the line begins with <code>#define</code>,
and the trailing <code>&nbsp;*/</code>.

<p>Then build or rebuild <code>g77</code> as appropriate.

Up:<a rel=up href="#Settings">Settings</a>
<br>

<h3>Maximum Stackable Size</h3>

<p><code>g77</code>, on most machines, puts many variables and arrays on the stack
where possible, and can be configured (by changing
<code>FFECOM_sizeMAXSTACKITEM</code> in <code>egcs/gcc/f/com.c</code>) to force
smaller-sized entities into static storage (saving
on stack space) or permit larger-sized entities to be put on the
stack (which can improve run-time performance, as it presents
more opportunities for the GBE to optimize the generated code).

<p><em>Note:</em> Putting more variables and arrays on the stack
might cause problems due to system-dependent limits on stack size. 
Also, the value of <code>FFECOM_sizeMAXSTACKITEM</code> has no
effect on automatic variables and arrays. 
See <a href="#But-bugs">But-bugs</a>, for more information.

<h3>Floating-point Bit Patterns</h3>

<p>The <code>g77</code> build will crash if an attempt is made to build
it as a cross-compiler
for a target when <code>g77</code> cannot reliably determine the bit pattern of
floating-point constants for the target. 
Planned improvements for version 0.6 of <code>g77</code>
will give it the capabilities it needs to not have to crash the build
but rather generate correct code for the target. 
(Currently, <code>g77</code>
would generate bad code under such circumstances if it didn't crash
during the build, e.g. when compiling a source file that does
something like <code>EQUIVALENCE (I,R)</code> and <code>DATA R/9.43578/</code>.)

Up:<a rel=up href="#Settings">Settings</a>
<br>

<h3>Initialization of Large Aggregate Areas</h3>

<p>A warning message is issued when <code>g77</code> sees code that provides
initial values (e.g. via <code>DATA</code>) to an aggregate area (<code>COMMON</code>
or <code>EQUIVALENCE</code>, or even a large enough array or <code>CHARACTER</code>
variable)
that is large enough to increase <code>g77</code>'s compile time by roughly
a factor of 10.

<p>This size currently is quite small, since <code>g77</code>
currently has a known bug requiring too much memory
and time to handle such cases. 
In <code>egcs/gcc/f/data.c</code>, the macro
<code>FFEDATA_sizeTOO_BIG_INIT_</code> is defined
to the minimum size for the warning to appear. 
The size is specified in storage units,
which can be bytes, words, or whatever, on a case-by-case basis.

<p>After changing this macro definition, you must
(of course) rebuild and reinstall <code>g77</code> for
the change to take effect.

<p>Note that, as of version 0.5.18, improvements have
reduced the scope of the problem for <em>sparse</em>
initialization of large arrays, especially those
with large, contiguous uninitialized areas. 
However, the warning is issued at a point prior to
when <code>g77</code> knows whether the initialization is sparse,
and delaying the warning could mean it is produced
too late to be helpful.

<p>Therefore, the macro definition should not be adjusted to
reflect sparse cases. 
Instead, adjust it to generate the warning when densely
initialized arrays begin to cause responses noticeably slower
than linear performance would suggest.

<h3>Alpha Problems Fixed</h3>

<p><code>g77</code> used to warn when it was used to compile Fortran code
for a target configuration that is not basically a 32-bit
machine (such as an Alpha, which is a 64-bit machine, especially
if it has a 64-bit operating system running on it). 
That was because <code>g77</code> was known to not work
properly on such configurations.

<p>As of version 0.5.20, <code>g77</code> is believed to work well
enough on such systems. 
So, the warning is no longer needed or provided.

<p>However, support for 64-bit systems, especially in
areas such as cross-compilation and handling of
intrinsics, is still incomplete. 
The symptoms
are believed to be compile-time diagnostics rather
than the generation of bad code. 
It is hoped that version 0.6 will completely support 64-bit
systems.

<h1>Debugging and Interfacing</h1>

<p>GNU Fortran currently generates code that is object-compatible with
the <code>f2c</code> converter. 
Also, it avoids limitations in the current GBE, such as the
inability to generate a procedure with
multiple entry points, by generating code that is structured
differently (in terms of procedure names, scopes, arguments, and
so on) than might be expected.

<p>As a result, writing code in other languages that calls on, is
called by, or shares in-memory data with <code>g77</code>-compiled code generally
requires some understanding of the way <code>g77</code> compiles code for
various constructs.

<p>Similarly, using a debugger to debug <code>g77</code>-compiled
code, even if that debugger supports native Fortran debugging, generally
requires this sort of information.

<p>This section describes some of the basic information on how
<code>g77</code> compiles code for constructs involving interfaces to other
languages and to debuggers.

<p><em>Caution:</em> Much or all of this information pertains to only the current
release of <code>g77</code>, sometimes even to using certain compiler options
with <code>g77</code> (such as <code>-fno-f2c</code>). 
Do not write code that depends on this
information without clearly marking said code as nonportable and
subject to review for every new release of <code>g77</code>. 
This information
is provided primarily to make debugging of code generated by this
particular release of <code>g77</code> easier for the user, and partly to make
writing (generally nonportable) interface code easier. 
Both of these
activities require tracking changes in new version of <code>g77</code> as they
are installed, because new versions can change the behaviors
described in this section.

<h2>Main Program Unit (PROGRAM)</h2>

<p>When <code>g77</code> compiles a main program unit, it gives it the public
procedure name <code>MAIN__</code>. 
The <code>libg2c</code> library has the actual <code>main()</code> procedure
as is typical of C-based environments, and
it is this procedure that performs some initial start-up
activity and then calls <code>MAIN__</code>.

<p>Generally, <code>g77</code> and <code>libg2c</code> are designed so that you need not
include a main program unit written in Fortran in your program--it
can be written in C or some other language. 
Especially for I/O handling, this is the case, although <code>g77</code> version 0.5.16
includes a bug fix for <code>libg2c</code> that solved a problem with using the
<code>OPEN</code> statement as the first Fortran I/O activity in a program
without a Fortran main program unit.

<p>However, if you don't intend to use <code>g77</code> (or <code>f2c</code>) to compile
your main program unit--that is, if you intend to compile a <code>main()</code>
procedure using some other language--you should carefully
examine the code for <code>main()</code> in <code>libg2c</code>, found in the source
file <code>egcs/libf2c/libF77/main.c</code>, to see what kinds of things
might need to be done by your <code>main()</code> in order to provide the
Fortran environment your Fortran code is expecting.

<p>For example, <code>libg2c</code>'s <code>main()</code> sets up the information used by
the <code>IARGC</code> and <code>GETARG</code> intrinsics. 
Bypassing <code>libg2c</code>'s <code>main()</code>
without providing a substitute for this activity would mean
that invoking <code>IARGC</code> and <code>GETARG</code> would produce undefined
results.

<p>When debugging, one implication of the fact that <code>main()</code>, which
is the place where the debugged program "starts" from the
debugger's point of view, is in <code>libg2c</code> is that you won't be
starting your Fortran program at a point you recognize as your
Fortran code.

<p>The standard way to get around this problem is to set a break
point (a one-time, or temporary, break point will do) at
the entrance to <code>MAIN__</code>, and then run the program. 
A convenient way to do so is to add the <code>gdb</code> command

<pre>tbreak MAIN__
</pre>

<p>to the file <code>.gdbinit</code> in the directory in which you're debugging
(using <code>gdb</code>).

<p>After doing this, the debugger will see the current execution
point of the program as at the beginning of the main program
unit of your program.

<p>Of course, if you really want to set a break point at some
other place in your program and just start the program
running, without first breaking at <code>MAIN__</code>,
that should work fine.

<h2>Procedures (SUBROUTINE and FUNCTION)</h2>

<p>Currently, <code>g77</code> passes arguments via reference--specifically,
by passing a pointer to the location in memory of a variable, array,
array element, a temporary location that holds the result of evaluating an
expression, or a temporary or permanent location that holds the value
of a constant.

<p>Procedures that accept <code>CHARACTER</code> arguments are implemented by
<code>g77</code> so that each <code>CHARACTER</code> argument has two actual arguments.

<p>The first argument occupies the expected position in the
argument list and has the user-specified name. 
This argument
is a pointer to an array of characters, passed by the caller.

<p>The second argument is appended to the end of the user-specified
calling sequence and is named <code>__g77_length_<var>x</var></code>, where <var>x</var>
is the user-specified name. 
This argument is of the C type <code>ftnlen</code>
(see <code>egcs/libf2c/g2c.h.in</code> for information on that type) and
is the number of characters the caller has allocated in the
array pointed to by the first argument.

<p>A procedure will ignore the length argument if <code>X</code> is not declared
<code>CHARACTER*(*)</code>, because for other declarations, it knows the
length. 
Not all callers necessarily "know" this, however, which
is why they all pass the extra argument.

<p>The contents of the <code>CHARACTER</code> argument are specified by the
address passed in the first argument (named after it). 
The procedure can read or write these contents as appropriate.

<p>When more than one <code>CHARACTER</code> argument is present in the argument
list, the length arguments are appended in the order
the original arguments appear. 
So <code>CALL FOO('HI','THERE')</code> is implemented in
C as <code>foo("hi","there",2,5);</code>, ignoring the fact that <code>g77</code>
does not provide the trailing null bytes on the constant
strings (<code>f2c</code> does provide them, but they are unnecessary in
a Fortran environment, and you should not expect them to be
there).

<p>Note that the above information applies to <code>CHARACTER</code> variables and
arrays <strong>only</strong>. 
It does <strong>not</strong> apply to external <code>CHARACTER</code>
functions or to intrinsic <code>CHARACTER</code> functions. 
That is, no second length argument is passed to <code>FOO</code> in this case:

<pre>CHARACTER X
EXTERNAL X
CALL FOO(X)
</pre>

<p>Nor does <code>FOO</code> expect such an argument in this case:

<pre>SUBROUTINE FOO(X)
CHARACTER X
EXTERNAL X
</pre>

<p>Because of this implementation detail, if a program has a bug
such that there is disagreement as to whether an argument is
a procedure, and the type of the argument is <code>CHARACTER</code>, subtle
symptoms might appear.

<p>For <code>CHARACTER</code>, <code>g77</code> implements a subroutine (a C function
returning <code>void</code>)
with two arguments prepended: <code>__g77_result</code>, which the caller passes
as a pointer to a <code>char</code> array expected to hold the return value,
and <code>__g77_length</code>, which the caller passes as an <code>ftnlen</code> value
specifying the length of the return value as declared in the calling
program. 
For <code>CHARACTER*(*)</code>, the called function uses <code>__g77_length</code>
to determine the size of the array that <code>__g77_result</code> points to;
otherwise, it ignores that argument.

<p>For <code>COMPLEX</code>, when <code>-ff2c</code> is in
force, <code>g77</code> implements
a subroutine with one argument prepended: <code>__g77_result</code>, which the
caller passes as a pointer to a variable of the type of the function. 
The called function writes the return value into this variable instead
of returning it as a function value. 
When <code>-fno-f2c</code> is in force,
<code>g77</code> implements a <code>COMPLEX</code> function as <code>gcc</code>'s
<code>__complex__ float</code> or <code>__complex__ double</code> function
(or an emulation thereof, when <code>-femulate-complex</code> is in effect),
returning the result of the function in the same way as <code>gcc</code> would.

<p>For <code>REAL(KIND=1)</code>, when <code>-ff2c</code> is in force, <code>g77</code> implements
a function that actually returns <code>REAL(KIND=2)</code> (typically
C's <code>double</code> type). 
When <code>-fno-f2c</code> is in force, <code>REAL(KIND=1)</code>
functions return <code>float</code>.

<h2>Names</h2>

<p>Fortran permits each implementation to decide how to represent
names as far as how they're seen in other contexts, such as debuggers
and when interfacing to other languages, and especially as far
as how casing is handled.

<p>External names--names of entities that are public, or "accessible",
to all modules in a program--normally have an underscore (<code>_</code>)
appended by <code>g77</code>,
to generate code that is compatible with <code>f2c</code>. 
External names include names of Fortran things like common blocks,
external procedures (subroutines and functions, but not including
statement functions, which are internal procedures), and entry point
names.

<p>However, use of the <code>-fno-underscoring</code> option
disables this kind of transformation of external names (though inhibiting
the transformation certainly improves the chances of colliding with
incompatible externals written in other languages--but that
might be intentional.

<p>When <code>-funderscoring</code> is in force, any name (external or local)
that already has at least one underscore in it is
implemented by <code>g77</code> by appending two underscores. 
(This second underscore can be disabled via the
<code>-fno-second-underscore</code> option.) 
External names are changed this way for <code>f2c</code> compatibility. 
Local names are changed this way to avoid collisions with external names
that are different in the source code--<code>f2c</code> does the same thing, but
there's no compatibility issue there except for user expectations while
debugging.

<p>For example:

<pre>Max_Cost = 0
</pre>

<p>Here, a user would, in the debugger, refer to this variable using the
name <code>max_cost__</code> (or <code>MAX_COST__</code> or <code>Max_Cost__</code>,
as described below). 
(We hope to improve <code>g77</code> in this regard in the future--don't
write scripts depending on this behavior! 
Also, consider experimenting with the <code>-fno-underscoring</code>
option to try out debugging without having to massage names by
hand like this.)

<p><code>g77</code> provides a number of command-line options that allow the user
to control how case mapping is handled for source files. 
The default is the traditional UNIX model for Fortran compilers--names
are mapped to lower case. 
Other command-line options can be specified to map names to upper
case, or to leave them exactly as written in the source file.

<p>For example:

<pre>Foo = 9.436
</pre>

<p>Here, it is normally the case that the variable assigned will be named
<code>foo</code>. 
This would be the name to enter when using a debugger to
access the variable.

<p>However, depending on the command-line options specified, the
name implemented by <code>g77</code> might instead be <code>FOO</code> or even
<code>Foo</code>, thus affecting how debugging is done.

<p>Also:

<pre>Call Foo
</pre>

<p>This would normally call a procedure that, if it were in a separate C program,
be defined starting with the line:

<pre>void foo_()
</pre>

<p>However, <code>g77</code> command-line options could be used to change the casing
of names, resulting in the name <code>FOO_</code> or <code>Foo_</code> being given to the
procedure instead of <code>foo_</code>, and the <code>-fno-underscoring</code> option
could be used to inhibit the appending of the underscore to the name.

<h2>Common Blocks (COMMON)</h2>

<p><code>g77</code> names and lays out <code>COMMON</code> areas
the same way <code>f2c</code> does,
for compatibility with <code>f2c</code>.

<p>Currently, <code>g77</code> does not emit "true" debugging information for
members of a <code>COMMON</code> area, due to an apparent bug in the GBE.

<p>(As of Version 0.5.19, <code>g77</code> emits debugging information for such
members in the form of a constant string specifying the base name of
the aggregate area and the offset of the member in bytes from the start
of the area. 
Use the <code>-fdebug-kludge</code> option to enable this behavior. 
In <code>gdb</code>, use <code>set language c</code> before printing the value
of the member, then <code>set language fortran</code> to restore the default
language, since <code>gdb</code> doesn't provide a way to print a readable
version of a character string in Fortran language mode.

<p>This kludge will be removed in a future version of <code>g77</code> that,
in conjunction with a contemporary version of <code>gdb</code>,
properly supports Fortran-language debugging, including access
to members of <code>COMMON</code> areas.)

<p>See <a href="#Code%20Gen%20Options">Options for Code Generation Conventions</a>,
for information on the <code>-fdebug-kludge</code> option.

<p>Moreover, <code>g77</code> currently implements a <code>COMMON</code> area such that its
type is an array of the C <code>char</code> data type.

<p>So, when debugging, you must know the offset into a <code>COMMON</code> area
for a particular item in that area, and you have to take into
account the appropriate multiplier for the respective sizes
of the types (as declared in your code) for the items preceding
the item in question as compared to the size of the <code>char</code> type.

<p>For example, using default implicit typing, the statement

<pre>COMMON I(15), R(20), T
</pre>

<p>results in a public 144-byte <code>char</code> array named <code>_BLNK__</code>
with <code>I</code> placed at <code>_BLNK__[0]</code>, <code>R</code> at <code>_BLNK__[60]</code>,
and <code>T</code> at <code>_BLNK__[140]</code>. 
(This is assuming that the target machine for
the compilation has 4-byte <code>INTEGER(KIND=1)</code> and <code>REAL(KIND=1)</code>
types.)

<h2>Local Equivalence Areas (EQUIVALENCE)</h2>

<p><code>g77</code> treats storage-associated areas involving a <code>COMMON</code>
block as explained in the section on common blocks.

<p>A local <code>EQUIVALENCE</code> area is a collection of variables and arrays
connected to each other in any way via <code>EQUIVALENCE</code>, none of which are
listed in a <code>COMMON</code> statement.

<p>Currently, <code>g77</code> does not emit "true" debugging information for
members in a local <code>EQUIVALENCE</code> area, due to an apparent bug in the GBE.

<p>(As of Version 0.5.19, <code>g77</code> does emit debugging information for such
members in the form of a constant string specifying the base name of
the aggregate area and the offset of the member in bytes from the start
of the area. 
Use the <code>-fdebug-kludge</code> option to enable this behavior. 
In <code>gdb</code>, use <code>set language c</code> before printing the value
of the member, then <code>set language fortran</code> to restore the default
language, since <code>gdb</code> doesn't provide a way to print a readable
version of a character string in Fortran language mode.

<p>This kludge will be removed in a future version of <code>g77</code> that,
in conjunction with a contemporary version of <code>gdb</code>,
properly supports Fortran-language debugging, including access
to members of <code>EQUIVALENCE</code> areas.)

<p>See <a href="#Code%20Gen%20Options">Options for Code Generation Conventions</a>,
for information on the <code>-fdebug-kludge</code> option.

<p>Moreover, <code>g77</code> implements a local <code>EQUIVALENCE</code> area such that its
type is an array of the C <code>char</code> data type.

<p>The name <code>g77</code> gives this array of <code>char</code> type is <code>__g77_equiv_<var>x</var></code>,
where <var>x</var> is the name of the item that is placed at the beginning (offset 0)
of this array. 
If more than one such item is placed at the beginning, <var>x</var> is
the name that sorts to the top in an alphabetical sort of the list of
such items.

<p>When debugging, you must therefore access members of <code>EQUIVALENCE</code>
areas by specifying the appropriate <code>__g77_equiv_<var>x</var></code>
array section with the appropriate offset. 
See the explanation of debugging <code>COMMON</code> blocks
for info applicable to debugging local <code>EQUIVALENCE</code> areas.

<p>(<em>Note:</em> <code>g77</code> version 0.5.18 and earlier chose the name
for <var>x</var> using a different method when more than one name was
in the list of names of entities placed at the beginning of the
array. 
Though the documentation specified that the first name listed in
the <code>EQUIVALENCE</code> statements was chosen for <var>x</var>, <code>g77</code>
in fact chose the name using a method that was so complicated,
it seemed easier to change it to an alphabetical sort than to describe the
previous method in the documentation.)

<h2>Complex Variables (COMPLEX)</h2>

<p>As of 0.5.20, <code>g77</code> defaults to handling <code>COMPLEX</code> types
(and related intrinsics, constants, functions, and so on)
in a manner that
makes direct debugging involving these types in Fortran
language mode difficult.

<p>Essentially, <code>g77</code> implements these types using an
internal construct similar to C's <code>struct</code>, at least
as seen by the <code>gcc</code> back end.

<p>Currently, the back end, when outputting debugging info with
the compiled code for the assembler to digest, does not detect
these <code>struct</code> types as being substitutes for Fortran
complex. 
As a result, the Fortran language modes of debuggers such as
<code>gdb</code> see these types as C <code>struct</code> types, which
they might or might not support.

<p>Until this is fixed, switch to C language mode to work with
entities of <code>COMPLEX</code> type and then switch back to Fortran language
mode afterward. 
(In <code>gdb</code>, this is accomplished via <code>set lang c</code> and
either <code>set lang fortran</code> or <code>set lang auto</code>.)

<h2>Arrays (DIMENSION)</h2>

<p>Fortran uses "column-major ordering" in its arrays. 
This differs from other languages, such as C, which use "row-major ordering". 
The difference is that, with Fortran, array elements adjacent to
each other in memory differ in the <em>first</em> subscript instead of
the last; <code>A(5,10,20)</code> immediately follows <code>A(4,10,20)</code>,
whereas with row-major ordering it would follow <code>A(5,10,19)</code>.

<p>This consideration
affects not only interfacing with and debugging Fortran code,
it can greatly affect how code is designed and written, especially
when code speed and size is a concern.

<p>Fortran also differs from C, a popular language for interfacing and
to support directly in debuggers, in the way arrays are treated. 
In C, arrays are single-dimensional and have interesting relationships
to pointers, neither of which is true for Fortran. 
As a result, dealing with Fortran arrays from within
an environment limited to C concepts can be challenging.

<p>For example, accessing the array element <code>A(5,10,20)</code> is easy enough
in Fortran (use <code>A(5,10,20)</code>), but in C some difficult machinations
are needed. 
First, C would treat the A array as a single-dimension array. 
Second, C does not understand low bounds for arrays as does Fortran. 
Third, C assumes a low bound of zero (0), while Fortran defaults to a
low bound of one (1) and can supports an arbitrary low bound. 
Therefore, calculations must be done
to determine what the C equivalent of <code>A(5,10,20)</code> would be, and these
calculations require knowing the dimensions of <code>A</code>.

<p>For <code>DIMENSION A(2:11,21,0:29)</code>, the calculation of the offset of
<code>A(5,10,20)</code> would be:

<pre>  (5-2)
+ (10-1)*(11-2+1)
+ (20-0)*(11-2+1)*(21-1+1)
= 4293
</pre>

<p>So the C equivalent in this case would be <code>a[4293]</code>.

<p>When using a debugger directly on Fortran code, the C equivalent
might not work, because some debuggers cannot understand the notion
of low bounds other than zero.  However, unlike <code>f2c</code>, <code>g77</code>
does inform the GBE that a multi-dimensional array (like <code>A</code>
in the above example) is really multi-dimensional, rather than a
single-dimensional array, so at least the dimensionality of the array
is preserved.

<p>Debuggers that understand Fortran should have no trouble with
non-zero low bounds, but for non-Fortran debuggers, especially
C debuggers, the above example might have a C equivalent of
<code>a[4305]</code>. 
This calculation is arrived at by eliminating the subtraction
of the lower bound in the first parenthesized expression on each
line--that is, for <code>(5-2)</code> substitute <code>(5)</code>, for <code>(10-1)</code>
substitute <code>(10)</code>, and for <code>(20-0)</code> substitute <code>(20)</code>. 
Actually, the implication of
this can be that the expression <code>*(&amp;a[2][1][0] + 4293)</code> works fine,
but that <code>a[20][10][5]</code> produces the equivalent of
<code>*(&amp;a[0][0][0] + 4305)</code> because of the missing lower bounds.

<p>Come to think of it, perhaps
the behavior is due to the debugger internally compensating for
the lower bounds by offsetting the base address of <code>a</code>, leaving
<code>&amp;a</code> set lower, in this case, than <code>&amp;a[2][1][0]</code> (the address of
its first element as identified by subscripts equal to the
corresponding lower bounds).

<p>You know, maybe nobody really needs to use arrays.

<h2>Adjustable Arrays (DIMENSION)</h2>

<p>Adjustable and automatic arrays in Fortran require the implementation
(in this
case, the <code>g77</code> compiler) to "memorize" the expressions that
dimension the arrays each time the procedure is invoked. 
This is so that subsequent changes to variables used in those
expressions, made during execution of the procedure, do not
have any effect on the dimensions of those arrays.

<p>For example:

<pre>REAL ARRAY(5)
DATA ARRAY/5*2/
CALL X(ARRAY, 5)
END
SUBROUTINE X(A, N)
DIMENSION A(N)
N = 20
PRINT *, N, A
END
</pre>

<p>Here, the implementation should, when running the program, print something
like:

<pre>20   2.  2.  2.  2.  2.
</pre>

<p>Note that this shows that while the value of <code>N</code> was successfully
changed, the size of the <code>A</code> array remained at 5 elements.

<p>To support this, <code>g77</code> generates code that executes before any user
code (and before the internally generated computed <code>GOTO</code> to handle
alternate entry points, as described below) that evaluates each
(nonconstant) expression in the list of subscripts for an
array, and saves the result of each such evaluation to be used when
determining the size of the array (instead of re-evaluating the
expressions).

<p>So, in the above example, when <code>X</code> is first invoked, code is
executed that copies the value of <code>N</code> to a temporary. 
And that same temporary serves as the actual high bound for the single
dimension of the <code>A</code> array (the low bound being the constant 1). 
Since the user program cannot (legitimately) change the value
of the temporary during execution of the procedure, the size
of the array remains constant during each invocation.

<p>For alternate entry points, the code <code>g77</code> generates takes into
account the possibility that a dummy adjustable array is not actually
passed to the actual entry point being invoked at that time. 
In that case, the public procedure implementing the entry point
passes to the master private procedure implementing all the
code for the entry points a <code>NULL</code> pointer where a pointer to that
adjustable array would be expected. 
The <code>g77</code>-generated code
doesn't attempt to evaluate any of the expressions in the subscripts
for an array if the pointer to that array is <code>NULL</code> at run time in
such cases. 
(Don't depend on this particular implementation
by writing code that purposely passes <code>NULL</code> pointers where the
callee expects adjustable arrays, even if you know the callee
won't reference the arrays--nor should you pass <code>NULL</code> pointers
for any dummy arguments used in calculating the bounds of such
arrays or leave undefined any values used for that purpose in
COMMON--because the way <code>g77</code> implements these things might
change in the future!)

<br>

<h2>Alternate Entry Points (ENTRY)</h2>

<p>The GBE does not understand the general concept of
alternate entry points as Fortran provides via the ENTRY statement. 
<code>g77</code> gets around this by using an approach to compiling procedures
having at least one <code>ENTRY</code> statement that is almost identical to the
approach used by <code>f2c</code>. 
(An alternate approach could be used that
would probably generate faster, but larger, code that would also
be a bit easier to debug.)

<p>Information on how <code>g77</code> implements <code>ENTRY</code> is provided for those
trying to debug such code. 
The choice of implementation seems
unlikely to affect code (compiled in other languages) that interfaces
to such code.

<p><code>g77</code> compiles exactly one public procedure for the primary entry
point of a procedure plus each <code>ENTRY</code> point it specifies, as usual. 
That is, in terms of the public interface, there is no difference
between

<pre>SUBROUTINE X
END
SUBROUTINE Y
END
</pre>

<p>and:

<pre>SUBROUTINE X
ENTRY Y
END
</pre>

<p>The difference between the above two cases lies in the code compiled
for the <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code> procedures themselves, plus the fact that,
for the second case, an extra internal procedure is compiled.

<p>For every Fortran procedure with at least one <code>ENTRY</code>
statement, <code>g77</code> compiles an extra procedure
named <code>__g77_masterfun_<var>x</var></code>, where <var>x</var> is
the name of the primary entry point (which, in the above case,
using the standard compiler options, would be <code>x_</code> in C).

<p>This extra procedure is compiled as a private procedure--that is,
a procedure not accessible by name to separately compiled modules. 
It contains all the code in the program unit, including the code
for the primary entry point plus for every entry point. 
(The code for each public procedure is quite short, and explained later.)

<p>The extra procedure has some other interesting characteristics.

<p>The argument list for this procedure is invented by <code>g77</code>. 
It contains
a single integer argument named <code>__g77_which_entrypoint</code>,
passed by value (as in Fortran's <code>%VAL()</code> intrinsic), specifying the
entry point index--0 for the primary entry point, 1 for the
first entry point (the first <code>ENTRY</code> statement encountered), 2 for
the second entry point, and so on.

<p>It also contains, for functions returning <code>CHARACTER</code> and
(when <code>-ff2c</code> is in effect) <code>COMPLEX</code> functions,
and for functions returning different types among the
<code>ENTRY</code> statements (e.g. <code>REAL FUNCTION R()</code>
containing <code>ENTRY I()</code>), an argument named <code>__g77_result</code> that
is expected at run time to contain a pointer to where to store
the result of the entry point. 
For <code>CHARACTER</code> functions, this
storage area is an array of the appropriate number of characters;
for <code>COMPLEX</code> functions, it is the appropriate area for the return
type; for multiple-return-type functions, it is a union of all the supported return
types (which cannot include <code>CHARACTER</code>, since combining <code>CHARACTER</code>
and non-<code>CHARACTER</code> return types via <code>ENTRY</code> in a single function
is not supported by <code>g77</code>).

<p>For <code>CHARACTER</code> functions, the <code>__g77_result</code> argument is followed
by yet another argument named <code>__g77_length</code> that, at run time,
specifies the caller's expected length of the returned value. 
Note that only <code>CHARACTER*(*)</code> functions and entry points actually
make use of this argument, even though it is always passed by
all callers of public <code>CHARACTER</code> functions (since the caller does not
generally know whether such a function is <code>CHARACTER*(*)</code> or whether
there are any other callers that don't have that information).

<p>The rest of the argument list is the union of all the arguments
specified for all the entry points (in their usual forms, e.g. 
<code>CHARACTER</code> arguments have extra length arguments, all appended at
the end of this list). 
This is considered the "master list" of
arguments.

<p>The code for this procedure has, before the code for the first
executable statement, code much like that for the following Fortran
statement:

<pre>       GOTO (100000,100001,100002), __g77_which_entrypoint
100000 <small>...</small>code for primary entry point<small>...</small>
100001 <small>...</small>code immediately following first ENTRY statement<small>...</small>
100002 <small>...</small>code immediately following second ENTRY statement<small>...</small>
</pre>

<p>(Note that invalid Fortran statement labels and variable names
are used in the above example to highlight the fact that it
represents code generated by the <code>g77</code> internals, not code to be
written by the user.)

<p>It is this code that, when the procedure is called, picks which
entry point to start executing.

<p>Getting back to the public procedures (<code>x</code> and <code>Y</code> in the original
example), those procedures are fairly simple. 
Their interfaces
are just like they would be if they were self-contained procedures
(without <code>ENTRY</code>), of course, since that is what the callers
expect. 
Their code consists of simply calling the private
procedure, described above, with the appropriate extra arguments
(the entry point index, and perhaps a pointer to a multiple-type-
return variable, local to the public procedure, that contains
all the supported returnable non-character types). 
For arguments
that are not listed for a given entry point that are listed for
other entry points, and therefore that are in the "master list"
for the private procedure, null pointers (in C, the <code>NULL</code> macro)
are passed. 
Also, for entry points that are part of a multiple-type-
returning function, code is compiled after the call of the private
procedure to extract from the multi-type union the appropriate result,
depending on the type of the entry point in question, returning
that result to the original caller.

<p>When debugging a procedure containing alternate entry points, you
can either set a break point on the public procedure itself (e.g. 
a break point on <code>X</code> or <code>Y</code>) or on the private procedure that
contains most of the pertinent code (e.g. <code>__g77_masterfun_<var>x</var></code>). 
If you do the former, you should use the debugger's command to
"step into" the called procedure to get to the actual code; with
the latter approach, the break point leaves you right at the
actual code, skipping over the public entry point and its call
to the private procedure (unless you have set a break point there
as well, of course).

<p>Further, the list of dummy arguments that is visible when the
private procedure is active is going to be the expanded version
of the list for whichever particular entry point is active,
as explained above, and the way in which return values are
handled might well be different from how they would be handled
for an equivalent single-entry function.

<h2>Alternate Returns (SUBROUTINE and RETURN)</h2>

<p>Subroutines with alternate returns (e.g. <code>SUBROUTINE X(*)</code> and
<code>CALL X(*50)</code>) are implemented by <code>g77</code> as functions returning
the C <code>int</code> type. 
The actual alternate-return arguments are omitted from the calling sequence. 
Instead, the caller uses
the return value to do a rough equivalent of the Fortran
computed-<code>GOTO</code> statement, as in <code>GOTO (50), X()</code> in the
example above (where <code>X</code> is quietly declared as an <code>INTEGER(KIND=1)</code>
function), and the callee just returns whatever integer
is specified in the <code>RETURN</code> statement for the subroutine
For example, <code>RETURN 1</code> is implemented as <code>X = 1</code> followed
by <code>RETURN</code>
in C, and <code>RETURN</code> by itself is <code>X = 0</code> and <code>RETURN</code>).

<h2>Assigned Statement Labels (ASSIGN and GOTO)</h2>

<p>For portability to machines where a pointer (such as to a label,
which is how <code>g77</code> implements <code>ASSIGN</code> and its relatives,
the assigned-<code>GOTO</code> and assigned-<code>FORMAT</code>-I/O statements)
is wider (bitwise) than an <code>INTEGER(KIND=1)</code>, <code>g77</code>
uses a different memory location to hold the <code>ASSIGN</code>ed value of a variable
than it does the numerical value in that variable, unless the
variable is wide enough (can hold enough bits).

<p>In particular, while <code>g77</code> implements

<pre>I = 10
</pre>

<p>as, in C notation, <code>i = 10;</code>, it implements

<pre>ASSIGN 10 TO I
</pre>

<p>as, in GNU's extended C notation (for the label syntax),
<code>__g77_ASSIGN_I = &amp;&amp;L10;</code> (where <code>L10</code> is just a massaging
of the Fortran label <code>10</code> to make the syntax C-like; <code>g77</code> doesn't
actually generate the name <code>L10</code> or any other name like that,
since debuggers cannot access labels anyway).

<p>While this currently means that an <code>ASSIGN</code> statement does not
overwrite the numeric contents of its target variable, <em>do not</em>
write any code depending on this feature. 
<code>g77</code> has already changed this implementation across
versions and might do so in the future. 
This information is provided only to make debugging Fortran programs
compiled with the current version of <code>g77</code> somewhat easier. 
If there's no debugger-visible variable named <code>__g77_ASSIGN_I</code>
in a program unit that does <code>ASSIGN 10 TO I</code>, that probably
means <code>g77</code> has decided it can store the pointer to the label directly
into <code>I</code> itself.

<p>See <a href="#Ugly%20Assigned%20Labels">Ugly Assigned Labels</a>, for information on a command-line option
to force <code>g77</code> to use the same storage for both normal and
assigned-label uses of a variable.

<h2>Run-time Library Errors</h2>

<p>The <code>libg2c</code> library currently has the following table to relate
error code numbers, returned in <code>IOSTAT=</code> variables, to messages. 
This information should, in future versions of this document, be
expanded upon to include detailed descriptions of each message.

<p>In line with good coding practices, any of the numbers in the
list below should <em>not</em> be directly written into Fortran
code you write. 
Instead, make a separate <code>INCLUDE</code> file that defines
<code>PARAMETER</code> names for them, and use those in your code,
so you can more easily change the actual numbers in the future.

<p>The information below is culled from the definition
of <code>F_err</code> in <code>f/runtime/libI77/err.c</code> in the
<code>g77</code> source tree.

<pre>100: "error in format"
101: "illegal unit number"
102: "formatted io not allowed"
103: "unformatted io not allowed"
104: "direct io not allowed"
105: "sequential io not allowed"

108: "can't stat file"
109: "unit not connected"

<h1>Collected Fortran Wisdom</h1>

<p>Most users of <code>g77</code> can be divided into two camps:

<ul>
<li>Those writing new Fortran code to be compiled by <code>g77</code>.

<li>Those using <code>g77</code> to compile existing, "legacy" code. 
</ul>

<p>Users writing new code generally understand most of the necessary
aspects of Fortran to write "mainstream" code, but often need
help deciding how to handle problems, such as the construction
of libraries containing <code>BLOCK DATA</code>.

<p>Users dealing with "legacy" code sometimes don't have much
experience with Fortran, but believe that the code they're compiling
already works when compiled by other compilers (and might
not understand why, as is sometimes the case, it doesn't work
when compiled by <code>g77</code>).

<p>The following information is designed to help users do a better job
coping with existing, "legacy" Fortran code, and with writing
new code as well.

<h2>Advantages Over f2c</h2>

<p>Without <code>f2c</code>, <code>g77</code> would have taken much longer to
do and probably not been as good for quite a while. 
Sometimes people who notice how much <code>g77</code> depends on, and
documents encouragement to use, <code>f2c</code> ask why <code>g77</code>
was created if <code>f2c</code> already existed.

<h3>Language Extensions</h3>

<p><code>g77</code> offers several extensions to FORTRAN 77 language that <code>f2c</code>
doesn't:

<ul>
<li>Automatic arrays

<li><code>CYCLE</code> and <code>EXIT</code>

<li>Construct names

<li><code>SELECT CASE</code>

<li><code>KIND=</code> and <code>LEN=</code> notation

<li>Semicolon as statement separator

<li>Constant expressions in <code>FORMAT</code> statements
(such as <code>FORMAT(I&lt;J&gt;)</code>,
where <code>J</code> is a <code>PARAMETER</code> named constant)

<li><code>MvBits</code> intrinsic

<li><code>libU77</code> (Unix-compatibility) library,
with routines known to compiler as intrinsics
(so they work even when compiler options are used
to change the interfaces used by Fortran routines)
</ul>

<p><code>g77</code> also implements iterative <code>DO</code> loops
so that they work even in the presence of certain "extreme" inputs,
unlike <code>f2c</code>. 
See <a href="#Loops">Loops</a>.

<p>However, <code>f2c</code> offers a few that <code>g77</code> doesn't, such as:

<ul>
<li>Intrinsics in <code>PARAMETER</code> statements

<li>Array bounds expressions (such as <code>REAL M(N(2))</code>)

<li><code>AUTOMATIC</code> statement
</ul>

<p>It is expected that <code>g77</code> will offer some or all of these missing
features at some time in the future.

<h3>Diagnostic Abilities</h3>

<p><code>g77</code> offers better diagnosis of problems in <code>FORMAT</code> statements. 
<code>f2c</code> doesn't, for example, emit any diagnostic for
<code>FORMAT(XZFAJG10324)</code>,
leaving that to be diagnosed, at run time, by
the <code>libf2c</code> run-time library.

<br>

<h3>Compiler Options</h3>

<p><code>g77</code> offers compiler options that <code>f2c</code> doesn't,
most of which are designed to more easily accommodate
legacy code:

<ul>
<li>Two that control the automatic appending of extra
underscores to external names

<li>One that allows dollar signs (<code>$</code>) in symbol names

<li>A variety that control acceptance of various
"ugly" constructs

<li>Several that specify acceptable use of upper and lower case
in the source code

<li>Many that enable, disable, delete, or hide
groups of intrinsics

<li>One to specify the length of fixed-form source lines
(normally 72)

<li>One to specify the the source code is written in
Fortran-90-style free-form
</ul>

<p>However, <code>f2c</code> offers a few that <code>g77</code> doesn't,
like an option to have <code>REAL</code> default to <code>REAL*8</code>. 
It is expected that <code>g77</code> will offer all of the
missing options pertinent to being a Fortran compiler
at some time in the future.

<h3>Compiler Speed</h3>

<p>Saving the steps of writing and then rereading C code is a big reason
why <code>g77</code> should be able to compile code much faster than using
<code>f2c</code> in conjunction with the equivalent invocation of <code>gcc</code>.

<p>However, due to <code>g77</code>'s youth, lots of self-checking is still being
performed. 
As a result, this improvement is as yet unrealized
(though the potential seems to be there for quite a big speedup
in the future). 
It is possible that, as of version 0.5.18, <code>g77</code>
is noticeably faster compiling many Fortran source files than using
<code>f2c</code> in conjunction with <code>gcc</code>.

<br>

<h3>Program Speed</h3>

<p><code>g77</code> has the potential to better optimize code than <code>f2c</code>,
even when <code>gcc</code> is used to compile the output of <code>f2c</code>,
because <code>f2c</code> must necessarily
translate Fortran into a somewhat lower-level language (C) that cannot
preserve all the information that is potentially useful for optimization,
while <code>g77</code> can gather, preserve, and transmit that information directly
to the GBE.

<p>For example, <code>g77</code> implements <code>ASSIGN</code> and assigned
<code>GOTO</code> using direct assignment of pointers to labels and direct
jumps to labels, whereas <code>f2c</code> maps the assigned labels to
integer values and then uses a C <code>switch</code> statement to encode
the assigned <code>GOTO</code> statements.

<p>However, as is typical, theory and reality don't quite match, at least
not in all cases, so it is still the case that <code>f2c</code> plus <code>gcc</code>
can generate code that is faster than <code>g77</code>.

<p>Version 0.5.18 of <code>g77</code> offered default
settings and options, via patches to the <code>gcc</code>
back end, that allow for better program speed, though
some of these improvements also affected the performance
of programs translated by <code>f2c</code> and then compiled
by <code>g77</code>'s version of <code>gcc</code>.

<p>Version 0.5.20 of <code>g77</code> offers further performance
improvements, at least one of which (alias analysis) is
not generally applicable to <code>f2c</code> (though <code>f2c</code>
could presumably be changed to also take advantage of
this new capability of the <code>gcc</code> back end, assuming
this is made available in an upcoming release of <code>gcc</code>).

<br>

<h3>Ease of Debugging</h3>

<p>Because <code>g77</code> compiles directly to assembler code like <code>gcc</code>,
instead of translating to an intermediate language (C) as does <code>f2c</code>,
support for debugging can be better for <code>g77</code> than <code>f2c</code>.

<p>However, although <code>g77</code> might be somewhat more "native" in terms of
debugging support than <code>f2c</code> plus <code>gcc</code>, there still are a lot
of things "not quite right". 
Many of the important ones should be resolved in the near future.

<p>For example, <code>g77</code> doesn't have to worry about reserved names
like <code>f2c</code> does. 
Given <code>FOR = WHILE</code>, <code>f2c</code> must necessarily
translate this to something <em>other</em> than
<code>for = while;</code>, because C reserves those words.

<p>However, <code>g77</code> does still uses things like an extra level of indirection
for <code>ENTRY</code>-laden procedures--in this case, because the back end doesn't
yet support multiple entry points.

<p>Another example is that, given

<pre>COMMON A, B
EQUIVALENCE (B, C)
</pre>

<p>the <code>g77</code> user should be able to access the variables directly, by name,
without having to traverse C-like structures and unions, while <code>f2c</code>
is unlikely to ever offer this ability (due to limitations in the
C language).

<p>However, due to apparent bugs in the back end, <code>g77</code> currently doesn't
take advantage of this facility at all--it doesn't emit any debugging
information for <code>COMMON</code> and <code>EQUIVALENCE</code> areas,
other than information
on the array of <code>char</code> it creates (and, in the case
of local <code>EQUIVALENCE</code>, names) for each such area.

<p>Yet another example is arrays. 
<code>g77</code> represents them to the debugger
using the same "dimensionality" as in the source code, while <code>f2c</code>
must necessarily convert them all to one-dimensional arrays to fit
into the confines of the C language. 
However, the level of support
offered by debuggers for interactive Fortran-style access to arrays
as compiled by <code>g77</code> can vary widely. 
In some cases, it can actually
be an advantage that <code>f2c</code> converts everything to widely supported
C semantics.

<p>In fairness, <code>g77</code> could do many of the things <code>f2c</code> does
to get things working at least as well as <code>f2c</code>--for now,
the developers prefer making <code>g77</code> work the
way they think it is supposed to, and finding help improving the
other products (the back end of <code>gcc</code>; <code>gdb</code>; and so on)
to get things working properly.

<br>

<h3>Character and Hollerith Constants</h3>

<p>To avoid the extensive hassle that would be needed to avoid this,
<code>f2c</code> uses C character constants to encode character and Hollerith
constants. 
That means a constant like <code>'HELLO'</code> is translated to
<code>"hello"</code> in C, which further means that an extra null byte is
present at the end of the constant. 
This null byte is superfluous.

<p><code>g77</code> does not generate such null bytes. 
This represents significant
savings of resources, such as on systems where <code>/dev/null</code> or
<code>/dev/zero</code> represent bottlenecks in the systems' performance,
because <code>g77</code> simply asks for fewer zeros from the operating
system than <code>f2c</code>. 
(Avoiding spurious use of zero bytes, each byte typically have
eight zero bits, also reduces the liabilities in case
Microsoft's rumored patent on the digits 0 and 1 is upheld.)

<h2>Block Data and Libraries</h2>

<p>To ensure that block data program units are linked, especially a concern
when they are put into libraries, give each one a name (as in
<code>BLOCK DATA FOO</code>) and make sure there is an <code>EXTERNAL FOO</code>
statement in every program unit that uses any common block
initialized by the corresponding <code>BLOCK DATA</code>. 
<code>g77</code> currently compiles a <code>BLOCK DATA</code> as if it were a
<code>SUBROUTINE</code>,
that is, it generates an actual procedure having the appropriate name. 
The procedure does nothing but return immediately if it happens to be
called. 
For <code>EXTERNAL FOO</code>, where <code>FOO</code> is not otherwise referenced in the
same program unit, <code>g77</code> assumes there exists a <code>BLOCK DATA FOO</code>
in the program and ensures that by generating a
reference to it so the linker will make sure it is present. 
(Specifically, <code>g77</code> outputs in the data section a static pointer to the
external name <code>FOO</code>.)

<p>The implementation <code>g77</code> currently uses to make this work is
one of the few things not compatible with <code>f2c</code> as currently
shipped. 
<code>f2c</code> currently does nothing with <code>EXTERNAL FOO</code> except
issue a warning that <code>FOO</code> is not otherwise referenced,
and, for <code>BLOCK DATA FOO</code>,
<code>f2c</code> doesn't generate a dummy procedure with the name <code>FOO</code>. 
The upshot is that you shouldn't mix <code>f2c</code> and <code>g77</code> in
this particular case. 
If you use <code>f2c</code> to compile <code>BLOCK DATA FOO</code>,
then any <code>g77</code>-compiled program unit that says <code>EXTERNAL FOO</code>
will result in an unresolved reference when linked. 
If you do the
opposite, then <code>FOO</code> might not be linked in under various
circumstances (such as when <code>FOO</code> is in a library, or you're
using a "clever" linker--so clever, it produces a broken program
with little or no warning by omitting initializations of global data
because they are contained in unreferenced procedures).

<p>The changes you make to your code to make <code>g77</code> handle this situation,
however, appear to be a widely portable way to handle it. 
That is, many systems permit it (as they should, since the
FORTRAN 77 standard permits <code>EXTERNAL FOO</code> when <code>FOO</code>
is a block data program unit), and of the ones
that might not link <code>BLOCK DATA FOO</code> under some circumstances, most of
them appear to do so once <code>EXTERNAL FOO</code> is present in the appropriate
program units.

<p>Here is the recommended approach to modifying a program containing
a program unit such as the following:

<pre>BLOCK DATA FOO
COMMON /VARS/ X, Y, Z
DATA X, Y, Z / 3., 4., 5. /
END
</pre>

<p>If the above program unit might be placed in a library module, then
ensure that every program unit in every program that references that
particular <code>COMMON</code> area uses the <code>EXTERNAL</code> statement
to force the area to be initialized.

<p>For example, change a program unit that starts with

<pre>INTEGER FUNCTION CURX()
COMMON /VARS/ X, Y, Z
CURX = X
END
</pre>

<p>so that it uses the <code>EXTERNAL</code> statement, as in:

<pre>INTEGER FUNCTION CURX()
COMMON /VARS/ X, Y, Z
EXTERNAL FOO
CURX = X
END
</pre>

<p>That way, <code>CURX</code> is compiled by <code>g77</code> (and many other
compilers) so that the linker knows it must include <code>FOO</code>,
the <code>BLOCK DATA</code> program unit that sets the initial values
for the variables in <code>VAR</code>, in the executable program.

<h2>Loops</h2>

<p>The meaning of a <code>DO</code> loop in Fortran is precisely specified
in the Fortran standard<small>...</small>and is quite different from what
many programmers might expect.

<p>In particular, Fortran iterative <code>DO</code> loops are implemented as if
the number of trips through the loop is calculated <em>before</em>
the loop is entered.

<p>The number of trips for a loop is calculated from the <var>start</var>,
<var>end</var>, and <var>increment</var> values specified in a statement such as:

<pre>DO <var>iter</var> = <var>start</var>, <var>end</var>, <var>increment</var>
</pre>

<p>The trip count is evaluated using a fairly simple formula
based on the three values following the <code>=</code> in the
statement, and it is that trip count that is effectively
decremented during each iteration of the loop. 
If, at the beginning of an iteration of the loop, the
trip count is zero or negative, the loop terminates. 
The per-loop-iteration modifications to <var>iter</var> are not
related to determining whether to terminate the loop.

<p>There are two important things to remember about the trip
count:

<ul>
<li>It can be <em>negative</em>, in which case it is
treated as if it was zero--meaning the loop is
not executed at all.

<li>The type used to <em>calculate</em> the trip count
is the same type as <var>iter</var>, but the final
calculation, and thus the type of the trip
count itself, always is <code>INTEGER(KIND=1)</code>. 
</ul>

<p>These two items mean that there are loops that cannot
be written in straightforward fashion using the Fortran <code>DO</code>.

<p>For example, on a system with the canonical 32-bit two's-complement
implementation of <code>INTEGER(KIND=1)</code>, the following loop will not work:

<pre>DO I = -2000000000, 2000000000
</pre>

<p>Although the <var>start</var> and <var>end</var> values are well within
the range of <code>INTEGER(KIND=1)</code>, the <em>trip count</em> is not. 
The expected trip count is 40000000001, which is outside
the range of <code>INTEGER(KIND=1)</code> on many systems.

<p>Instead, the above loop should be constructed this way:

<pre>I = -2000000000
DO
  IF (I .GT. 2000000000) EXIT
  <small>...</small>
  I = I + 1
END DO
</pre>

<p>The simple <code>DO</code> construct and the <code>EXIT</code> statement
(used to leave the innermost loop)
are F90 features that <code>g77</code> supports.

<p>Some Fortran compilers have buggy implementations of <code>DO</code>,
in that they don't follow the standard. 
They implement <code>DO</code> as a straightforward translation
to what, in C, would be a <code>for</code> statement. 
Instead of creating a temporary variable to hold the trip count
as calculated at run time, these compilers
use the iteration variable <var>iter</var> to control
whether the loop continues at each iteration.

<p>The bug in such an implementation shows up when the
trip count is within the range of the type of <var>iter</var>,
but the magnitude of <code>ABS(<var>end</var>) + ABS(<var>incr</var>)</code>
exceeds that range.  For example:

<pre>DO I = 2147483600, 2147483647
</pre>

<p>A loop started by the above statement will work as implemented
by <code>g77</code>, but the use, by some compilers, of a
more C-like implementation akin to

<pre>for (i = 2147483600; i &lt;= 2147483647; ++i)
</pre>

<p>produces a loop that does not terminate, because <code>i</code>
can never be greater than 2147483647, since incrementing it
beyond that value overflows <code>i</code>, setting it to -2147483648. 
This is a large, negative number that still is less than 2147483647.

<p>Another example of unexpected behavior of <code>DO</code> involves
using a nonintegral iteration variable <var>iter</var>, that is,
a <code>REAL</code> variable. 
Consider the following program:

<pre>      DATA BEGIN, END, STEP /.1, .31, .007/
      DO 10 R = BEGIN, END, STEP
         IF (R .GT. END) PRINT *, R, ' .GT. ', END, '!!'
         PRINT *,R
10    CONTINUE
      PRINT *,'LAST = ',R
      IF (R .LE. END) PRINT *, R, ' .LE. ', END, '!!'
      END
</pre>

<p>A C-like view of <code>DO</code> would hold that the two "exclamatory"
<code>PRINT</code> statements are never executed. 
However, this is the output of running the above program
as compiled by <code>g77</code> on a GNU/Linux ix86 system:

<pre> .100000001
 .107000001
 .114
 .120999999
 <small>...</small>
 .289000005
 .296000004
 .303000003
LAST =   .310000002
 .310000002 .LE.   .310000002!!
</pre>

<p>Note that one of the two checks in the program turned up
an apparent violation of the programmer's expectation--yet,
the loop is correctly implemented by <code>g77</code>, in that
it has 30 iterations. 
This trip count of 30 is correct when evaluated using
the floating-point representations for the <var>begin</var>,
<var>end</var>, and <var>incr</var> values (.1, .31, .007) on GNU/Linux
ix86 are used. 
On other systems, an apparently more accurate trip count
of 31 might result, but, nevertheless, <code>g77</code> is
faithfully following the Fortran standard, and the result
is not what the author of the sample program above
apparently expected. 
(Such other systems might, for different values in the <code>DATA</code>
statement, violate the other programmer's expectation,
for example.)

<p>Due to this combination of imprecise representation
of floating-point values and the often-misunderstood
interpretation of <code>DO</code> by standard-conforming
compilers such as <code>g77</code>, use of <code>DO</code> loops
with <code>REAL</code> iteration
variables is not recommended. 
Such use can be caught by specifying <code>-Wsurprising</code>. 
See <a href="#Warning%20Options">Warning Options</a>, for more information on this

<h2>Working Programs</h2>

<h3>Not My Type</h3>

<p>A fruitful source of bugs in Fortran source code is use, or
mis-use, of Fortran's implicit-typing feature, whereby the
type of a variable, array, or function is determined by the
first character of its name.

<p>Simple cases of this include statements like <code>LOGX=9.227</code>,
without a statement such as <code>REAL LOGX</code>. 
In this case, <code>LOGX</code> is implicitly given <code>INTEGER(KIND=1)</code>
type, with the result of the assignment being that it is given
the value <code>9</code>.

<p>More involved cases include a function that is defined starting
with a statement like <code>DOUBLE PRECISION FUNCTION IPS(<small>...</small>)</code>. 
Any caller of this function that does not also declare <code>IPS</code>
as type <code>DOUBLE PRECISION</code> (or, in GNU Fortran, <code>REAL(KIND=2)</code>)
is likely to assume it returns
<code>INTEGER</code>, or some other type, leading to invalid results
or even program crashes.

<p>The <code>-Wimplicit</code> option might catch failures to
properly specify the types of
variables, arrays, and functions in the code.

<p>However, in code that makes heavy use of Fortran's
implicit-typing facility, this option might produce so
many warnings about cases that are working, it would be
hard to find the one or two that represent bugs. 
This is why so many experienced Fortran programmers strongly
recommend widespread use of the <code>IMPLICIT NONE</code> statement,
despite it not being standard FORTRAN 77, to completely turn
off implicit typing. 
(<code>g77</code> supports <code>IMPLICIT NONE</code>, as do almost all
FORTRAN 77 compilers.)

<p>Note that <code>-Wimplicit</code> catches only implicit typing of
<em>names</em>. 
It does not catch implicit typing of expressions such
as <code>X**(2/3)</code>. 
Such expressions can be buggy as well--in fact, <code>X**(2/3)</code>
is equivalent to <code>X**0</code>, due to the way Fortran expressions
are given types and then evaluated. 
(In this particular case, the programmer probably wanted
<code>X**(2./3.)</code>.)

<h3>Variables Assumed To Be Zero</h3>

<p>Many Fortran programs were developed on systems that provided
automatic initialization of all, or some, variables and arrays
to zero. 
As a result, many of these programs depend, sometimes
inadvertently, on this behavior, though to do so violates
the Fortran standards.

<p>You can ask <code>g77</code> for this behavior by specifying the
<code>-finit-local-zero</code> option when compiling Fortran code. 
(You might want to specify <code>-fno-automatic</code> as well,
to avoid code-size inflation for non-optimized compilations.)

<p>Note that a program that works better when compiled with the
<code>-finit-local-zero</code> option
is almost certainly depending on a particular system's,
or compiler's, tendency to initialize some variables to zero. 
It might be worthwhile finding such cases and fixing them,
using techniques such as compiling with the <code>-O -Wuninitialized</code>
options using <code>g77</code>.

<br>

<h3>Variables Assumed To Be Saved</h3>

<p>Many Fortran programs were developed on systems that
saved the values of all, or some, variables and arrays
across procedure calls. 
As a result, many of these programs depend, sometimes
inadvertently, on being able to assign a value to a
variable, perform a <code>RETURN</code> to a calling procedure,
and, upon subsequent invocation, reference the previously
assigned variable to obtain the value.

<p>They expect this despite not using the <code>SAVE</code> statement
to specify that the value in a variable is expected to survive
procedure returns and calls. 
Depending on variables and arrays to retain values across
procedure calls without using <code>SAVE</code> to require it violates
the Fortran standards.

<p>You can ask <code>g77</code> to assume <code>SAVE</code> is specified for all
relevant (local) variables and arrays by using the
<code>-fno-automatic</code> option.

<p>Note that a program that works better when compiled with the
<code>-fno-automatic</code> option
is almost certainly depending on not having to use
the <code>SAVE</code> statement as required by the Fortran standard. 
It might be worthwhile finding such cases and fixing them,
using techniques such as compiling with the <code>-O -Wuninitialized</code>
options using <code>g77</code>.

<h3>Unwanted Variables</h3>

<p>The <code>-Wunused</code> option can find bugs involving
implicit typing, sometimes
more easily than using <code>-Wimplicit</code> in code that makes
heavy use of implicit typing. 
An unused variable or array might indicate that the
spelling for its declaration is different from that of
its intended uses.

<p>Other than cases involving typos, unused variables rarely
indicate actual bugs in a program. 
However, investigating such cases thoroughly has, on occasion,
led to the discovery of code that had not been completely
written--where the programmer wrote declarations as needed
for the whole algorithm, wrote some or even most of the code
for that algorithm, then got distracted and forgot that the
job was not complete.

<br>

<h3>Unused Arguments</h3>

<p>As with unused variables, It is possible that unused arguments
to a procedure might indicate a bug. 
Compile with <code>-W -Wunused</code> option to catch cases of
unused arguments.

<p>Note that <code>-W</code> also enables warnings regarding overflow
of floating-point constants under certain circumstances.

<h3>Surprising Interpretations of Code</h3>

<p>The <code>-Wsurprising</code> option can help find bugs involving
expression evaluation or in
the way <code>DO</code> loops with non-integral iteration variables
are handled. 
Cases found by this option might indicate a difference of
interpretation between the author of the code involved, and
a standard-conforming compiler such as <code>g77</code>. 
Such a difference might produce actual bugs.

<p>In any case, changing the code to explicitly do what the
programmer might have expected it to do, so <code>g77</code> and
other compilers are more likely to follow the programmer's
expectations, might be worthwhile, especially if such changes
make the program work better.

<h3>Aliasing Assumed To Work</h3>

<p>The <code>-falias-check</code>, <code>-fargument-alias</code>,
<code>-fargument-noalias</code>,
and <code>-fno-argument-noalias-global</code> options,
introduced in version 0.5.20 and
<code>g77</code>'s version 2.7.2.2.f.2 of <code>gcc</code>,
were withdrawn as of <code>g77</code> version 0.5.23
due to their not being supported by <code>gcc</code> version 2.8.

<p>These options, which control the assumptions regarding aliasing
(overlapping) of writes and reads to main memory (core) made
by the <code>gcc</code> back end,
might well be added back (in some form) in a future version
of <code>gcc</code>.

<p>However, these options <em>are</em> supported by <code>egcs</code>.

<p>The information below still is useful, but applies to
only those versions of <code>g77</code> that support the
alias analysis implied by support for these options.

<p>These options are effective only when compiling with <code>-O</code>
(specifying any level other than <code>-O0</code>)
or with <code>-falias-check</code>.

<p>The default for Fortran code is <code>-fargument-noalias-global</code>. 
(The default for C code and code written in other C-based languages
is <code>-fargument-alias</code>. 
These defaults apply regardless of whether you use <code>g77</code> or
<code>gcc</code> to compile your code.)

<p>Note that, on some systems, compiling with <code>-fforce-addr</code> in
effect can produce more optimal code when the default aliasing
options are in effect (and when optimization is enabled).

<p>If your program is not working when compiled with optimization,
it is possible it is violating the Fortran standards (77 and 90)
by relying on the ability to "safely" modify variables and
arrays that are aliased, via procedure calls, to other variables
and arrays, without using <code>EQUIVALENCE</code> to explicitly
set up this kind of aliasing.

<p>(The FORTRAN 77 standard's prohibition of this sort of
overlap, generally referred to therein as "storage
assocation", appears in Sections 15.9.3.6. 
This prohibition allows implementations, such as <code>g77</code>,
to, for example, implement the passing of procedures and
even values in <code>COMMON</code> via copy operations into local,
perhaps more efficiently accessed temporaries at entry to a
procedure, and, where appropriate, via copy operations back
out to their original locations in memory at exit from that
procedure, without having to take into consideration the
order in which the local copies are updated by the code,
among other things.)

<p>To test this hypothesis, try compiling your program with
the <code>-fargument-alias</code> option, which causes the
compiler to revert to assumptions essentially the same as
made by versions of <code>g77</code> prior to 0.5.20.

<p>If the program works using this option, that strongly suggests
that the bug is in your program. 
Finding and fixing the bug(s) should result in a program that
is more standard-conforming and that can be compiled by <code>g77</code>
in a way that results in a faster executable.

<p>(You might want to try compiling with <code>-fargument-noalias</code>,
a kind of half-way point, to see if the problem is limited to
aliasing between dummy arguments and <code>COMMON</code> variables--this
option assumes that such aliasing is not done, while still allowing
aliasing among dummy arguments.)

<p>An example of aliasing that is invalid according to the standards
is shown in the following program, which might <em>not</em> produce
the expected results when executed:

<pre>I = 1
CALL FOO(I, I)
PRINT *, I
END

SUBROUTINE FOO(J, K)
J = J + K
K = J * K
PRINT *, J, K
END
</pre>

<p>The above program attempts to use the temporary aliasing of the
<code>J</code> and <code>K</code> arguments in <code>FOO</code> to effect a
pathological behavior--the simultaneous changing of the values
of <em>both</em> <code>J</code> and <code>K</code> when either one of them
is written.

<p>The programmer likely expects the program to print these values:

<pre>2  4
4
</pre>

<p>However, since the program is not standard-conforming, an
implementation's behavior when running it is undefined, because
subroutine <code>FOO</code> modifies at least one of the arguments,
and they are aliased with each other. 
(Even if one of the assignment statements was deleted, the
program would still violate these rules. 
This kind of on-the-fly aliasing is permitted by the standard
only when none of the aliased items are defined, or written,
while the aliasing is in effect.)

<p>As a practical example, an optimizing compiler might schedule
the <code>J =</code> part of the second line of <code>FOO</code> <em>after</em>
the reading of <code>J</code> and <code>K</code> for the <code>J * K</code> expression,
resulting in the following output:

<pre>2  2
2
</pre>

<p>Essentially, compilers are promised (by the standard and, therefore,
by programmers who write code they claim to be standard-conforming)
that if they cannot detect aliasing via static analysis of a single
program unit's <code>EQUIVALENCE</code> and <code>COMMON</code> statements, no
such aliasing exists. 
In such cases, compilers are free to assume that an assignment to
one variable will not change the value of another variable, allowing
it to avoid generating code to re-read the value of the other
variable, to re-schedule reads and writes, and so on, to produce
a faster executable.

<p>The same promise holds true for arrays (as seen by the called
procedure)--an element of one dummy array cannot be aliased
with, or overlap, any element of another dummy array or be
in a <code>COMMON</code> area known to the procedure.

<p>(These restrictions apply only when the procedure defines, or
writes to, one of the aliased variables or arrays.)

<p>Unfortunately, there is no way to find <em>all</em> possible cases of
violations of the prohibitions against aliasing in Fortran code. 
Static analysis is certainly imperfect, as is run-time analysis,
since neither can catch all violations. 
(Static analysis can catch all likely violations, and some that
might never actually happen, while run-time analysis can catch
only those violations that actually happen during a particular run. 
Neither approach can cope with programs mixing Fortran code with
routines written in other languages, however.)

<p>Currently, <code>g77</code> provides neither static nor run-time facilities
to detect any cases of this problem, although other products might. 
Run-time facilities are more likely to be offered by future
versions of <code>g77</code>, though patches improving <code>g77</code> so that
it provides either form of detection are welcome.

<h3>Output Assumed To Flush</h3>

<p>For several versions prior to 0.5.20, <code>g77</code> configured its
version of the <code>libf2c</code> run-time library so that one of
its configuration macros, <code>ALWAYS_FLUSH</code>, was defined.

<p>This was done as a result of a belief that many programs expected
output to be flushed to the operating system (under UNIX, via
the <code>fflush()</code> library call) with the result that errors,
such as disk full, would be immediately flagged via the
relevant <code>ERR=</code> and <code>IOSTAT=</code> mechanism.

<p>Because of the adverse effects this approach had on the performance
of many programs, <code>g77</code> no longer configures <code>libf2c</code>
(now named <code>libg2c</code> in its <code>g77</code> incarnation)
to always flush output.

<p>If your program depends on this behavior, either insert the
appropriate <code>CALL FLUSH</code> statements, or modify the sources
to the <code>libg2c</code>, rebuild and reinstall <code>g77</code>, and
relink your programs with the modified library.

<p>(Ideally, <code>libg2c</code> would offer the choice at run-time, so
that a compile-time option to <code>g77</code> or <code>f2c</code> could
result in generating the appropriate calls to flushing or
non-flushing library routines.)

<p>See <a href="#Always%20Flush%20Output">Always Flush Output</a>, for information on how to modify
the <code>g77</code> source tree so that a version of <code>libg2c</code>
can be built and installed with the <code>ALWAYS_FLUSH</code> macro defined.

<h3>Large File Unit Numbers</h3>

<p>If your program crashes at run time with a message including
the text <code>illegal unit number</code>, that probably is
a message from the run-time library, <code>libg2c</code>.

<p>The message means that your program has attempted to use a
file unit number that is out of the range accepted by
<code>libg2c</code>. 
Normally, this range is 0 through 99, and the high end
of the range is controlled by a <code>libg2c</code> source-file
macro named <code>MXUNIT</code>.

<p>If you can easily change your program to use unit numbers
in the range 0 through 99, you should do so.

<p>Otherwise, see <a href="#Larger%20File%20Unit%20Numbers">Larger File Unit Numbers</a>, for information on how
to change <code>MXUNIT</code> in <code>libg2c</code> so you can build and
install a new version of <code>libg2c</code> that supports the larger
unit numbers you need.

<p><em>Note:</em> While <code>libg2c</code> places a limit on the range
of Fortran file-unit numbers, the underlying library and operating
system might impose different kinds of limits. 
For example, some systems limit the number of files simultaneously
open by a running program. 
Information on how to increase these limits should be found
in your system's documentation.

<h3>Floating-point precision</h3>

<p>If your program depends on exact IEEE 754 floating-point handling it may
help on some systems--specifically x86 or m68k hardware--to use
the <code>-ffloat-store</code> option or to reset the precision flag on the
floating-point unit. 
See <a href="#Optimize%20Options">Optimize Options</a>.

<p>However, it might be better simply to put the FPU into double precision
mode and not take the performance hit of <code>-ffloat-store</code>.  On x86
and m68k GNU systems you can do this with a technique similar to that
for turning on floating-point exceptions
(see <a href="#Floating-point%20Exception%20Handling">Floating-point Exception Handling</a>). 
The control word could be set to double precision by
replacing the <code>__setfpucw</code> call with one like this:
<pre>  __setfpucw ((_FPU_DEFAULT &amp; ~_FPU_EXTENDED) | _FPU_DOUBLE);
</pre>
(It is not clear whether this has any effect on the operation of the GNU
maths library, but we have no evidence of it causing trouble.)

<p>Some targets (such as the Alpha) may need special options for full IEEE
conformance. 
See <a href="gcc.html#Hardware%20Models%20and%20Configurations">Submodel Options</a>.

<br>

<h3>Inconsistent Calling Sequences</h3>

<p>Code containing inconsistent calling sequences in the same file is
normally rejected--see <a href="#GLOBALS">GLOBALS</a>. 
(Use, say, <code>ftnchek</code> to ensure
consistency across source files. 
See <a href="#f2c%20Skeletons%20and%20Prototypes">Generating Skeletons and Prototypes with <code>f2c</code></a>.)

<p>Mysterious errors, which may appear to be code generation problems, can
appear specifically on the x86 architecture with some such
inconsistencies.  On x86 hardware, floating-point return values of
functions are placed on the floating-point unit's register stack, not
the normal stack.  Thus calling a <code>REAL</code> or <code>DOUBLE PRECISION</code>
<code>FUNCTION</code> as some other sort of procedure, or vice versa,
scrambles the floating-point stack.  This may break unrelated code
executed later.  Similarly if, say, external C routines are written
incorrectly.

<h2>Overly Convenient Command-line Options</h2>

<p>These options should be used only as a quick-and-dirty way to determine
how well your program will run under different compilation models
without having to change the source. 
Some are more problematic
than others, depending on how portable and maintainable you want the
program to be (and, of course, whether you are allowed to change it
at all is crucial).

<p>You should not continue to use these command-line options to compile
a given program, but rather should make changes to the source code:

<dl>
<dt><code>-finit-local-zero</code>
<dd>(This option specifies that any uninitialized local variables
and arrays have default initialization to binary zeros.)

<p>Many other compilers do this automatically, which means lots of
Fortran code developed with those compilers depends on it.

<p>It is safer (and probably
would produce a faster program) to find the variables and arrays that
need such initialization and provide it explicitly via <code>DATA</code>, so that
<code>-finit-local-zero</code> is not needed.

<p>Consider using <code>-Wuninitialized</code> (which requires <code>-O</code>) to
find likely candidates, but
do not specify <code>-finit-local-zero</code> or <code>-fno-automatic</code>,
or this technique won't work.

<br><dt><code>-fno-automatic</code>
<dd>(This option specifies that all local variables and arrays
are to be treated as if they were named in <code>SAVE</code> statements.)

<p>Many other compilers do this automatically, which means lots of
Fortran code developed with those compilers depends on it.

<p>The effect of this is that all non-automatic variables and arrays
are made static, that is, not placed on the stack or in heap storage. 
This might cause a buggy program to appear to work better. 
If so, rather than relying on this command-line option (and hoping all
compilers provide the equivalent one), add <code>SAVE</code>
statements to some or all program unit sources, as appropriate. 
Consider using <code>-Wuninitialized</code> (which requires <code>-O</code>)
to find likely candidates, but
do not specify <code>-finit-local-zero</code> or <code>-fno-automatic</code>,
or this technique won't work.

<p>The default is <code>-fautomatic</code>, which tells <code>g77</code> to try
and put variables and arrays on the stack (or in fast registers)
where possible and reasonable. 
This tends to make programs faster.

<p><em>Note:</em> Automatic variables and arrays are not affected
by this option. 
These are variables and arrays that are <em>necessarily</em> automatic,
either due to explicit statements, or due to the way they are
declared. 
Examples include local variables and arrays not given the
<code>SAVE</code> attribute in procedures declared <code>RECURSIVE</code>,
and local arrays declared with non-constant bounds (automatic
arrays). 
Currently, <code>g77</code> supports only automatic arrays, not
<code>RECURSIVE</code> procedures or other means of explicitly
specifying that variables or arrays are automatic.

<br><dt><code>-f<var>group</var>-intrinsics-hide</code>
<dd>Change the source code to use <code>EXTERNAL</code> for any external procedure
that might be the name of an intrinsic. 
It is easy to find these using <code>-f<var>group</var>-intrinsics-disable</code>.

<h2>Faster Programs</h2>

<p>Aside from the usual <code>gcc</code> options, such as <code>-O</code>,

<br>

<h3>Aligned Data</h3>

<p>On some systems, such as those with Pentium Pro CPUs, programs
that make heavy use of <code>REAL(KIND=2)</code> (<code>DOUBLE PRECISION</code>)
might run much slower
than possible due to the compiler not aligning these 64-bit
values to 64-bit boundaries in memory. 
(The effect also is present, though
to a lesser extent, on the 586 (Pentium) architecture.)

<p>The Intel x86 architecture generally ensures that these programs will
work on all its implementations,
but particular implementations (such as Pentium Pro)
perform better with more strict alignment. 
(Such behavior isn't unique to the Intel x86 architecture.) 
Other architectures might <em>demand</em> 64-bit alignment
of 64-bit data.

<p>There are a variety of approaches to use to address this problem:

<ul>
<li>Order your <code>COMMON</code> and <code>EQUIVALENCE</code> areas such
that the variables and arrays with the widest alignment
guidelines come first.

<p>For example, on most systems, this would mean placing
<code>COMPLEX(KIND=2)</code>, <code>REAL(KIND=2)</code>, and
<code>INTEGER(KIND=2)</code> entities first, followed by <code>REAL(KIND=1)</code>,
<code>INTEGER(KIND=1)</code>, and <code>LOGICAL(KIND=1)</code> entities, then
<code>INTEGER(KIND=6)</code> entities, and finally <code>CHARACTER</code>
and <code>INTEGER(KIND=3)</code> entities.

<p>The reason to use such placement is it makes it more likely
that your data will be aligned properly, without requiring
you to do detailed analysis of each aggregate (<code>COMMON</code>
and <code>EQUIVALENCE</code>) area.

<p>Specifically, on systems where the above guidelines are
appropriate, placing <code>CHARACTER</code> entities before
<code>REAL(KIND=2)</code> entities can work just as well,
but only if the number of bytes occupied by the <code>CHARACTER</code>
entities is divisible by the recommended alignment for
<code>REAL(KIND=2)</code>.

<p>By ordering the placement of entities in aggregate
areas according to the simple guidelines above, you
avoid having to carefully count the number of bytes
occupied by each entity to determine whether the
actual alignment of each subsequent entity meets the
alignment guidelines for the type of that entity.

<p>If you don't ensure correct alignment of <code>COMMON</code> elements, the
compiler may be forced by some systems to violate the Fortran semantics by
adding padding to get <code>DOUBLE PRECISION</code> data properly aligned. 
If the unfortunate practice is employed of overlaying different types of
data in the <code>COMMON</code> block, the different variants
of this block may become misaligned with respect to each other. 
Even if your platform doesn't require strict alignment,
<code>COMMON</code> should be laid out as above for portability. 
(Unfortunately the FORTRAN 77 standard didn't anticipate this
possible requirement, which is compiler-independent on a given platform.)

</p><li>Use the (x86-specific) <code>-malign-double</code> option when compiling
programs for the Pentium and Pentium Pro architectures (called 586
and 686 in the <code>gcc</code> configuration subsystem). 
The warning about this in the <code>gcc</code> manual isn't
generally relevant to Fortran,
but using it will force <code>COMMON</code> to be padded if necessary to align
<code>DOUBLE PRECISION</code> data.

<p>When <code>DOUBLE PRECISION</code> data is forcibly aligned
in <code>COMMON</code> by <code>g77</code> due to specifying <code>-malign-double</code>,
<code>g77</code> issues a warning about the need to
insert padding.

<p>In this case, each and every program unit that uses
the same <code>COMMON</code> area
must specify the same layout of variables and their types
for that area
and be compiled with <code>-malign-double</code> as well. 
<code>g77</code> will issue warnings in each case,
but as long as every program unit using that area
is compiled with the same warnings,
the resulting object files should work when linked together
unless the program makes additional assumptions about
<code>COMMON</code> area layouts that are outside the scope
of the FORTRAN 77 standard,
or uses <code>EQUIVALENCE</code> or different layouts
in ways that assume no padding is ever inserted by the compiler.

</p><li>Ensure that <code>crt0.o</code> or <code>crt1.o</code>
on your system guarantees a 64-bit
aligned stack for <code>main()</code>. 
The recent one from GNU (<code>glibc2</code>) will do this on x86 systems,
but we don't know of any other x86 setups where it will be right. 
Read your system's documentation to determine if
it is appropriate to upgrade to a more recent version
to obtain the optimal alignment. 
</ul>

<p>Progress is being made on making this work
"out of the box" on future versions of <code>g77</code>,
<code>gcc</code>, and some of the relevant operating systems
(such as GNU/Linux).

<p>A package that tests the degree to which a Fortran compiler
(such as <code>g77</code>)
aligns 64-bit floating-point variables and arrays
is available at <a href="ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/g77/align/">ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/g77/align/</a>.

<h3>Prefer Automatic Uninitialized Variables</h3>

<p>If you're using <code>-fno-automatic</code> already, you probably
should change your code to allow compilation with <code>-fautomatic</code>
(the default), to allow the program to run faster.

<p>Similarly, you should be able to use <code>-fno-init-local-zero</code>
(the default) instead of <code>-finit-local-zero</code>. 
This is because it is rare that every variable affected by these
options in a given program actually needs to
be so affected.

<p>For example, <code>-fno-automatic</code>, which effectively <code>SAVE</code>s
every local non-automatic variable and array, affects even things like
<code>DO</code> iteration
variables, which rarely need to be <code>SAVE</code>d, and this often reduces
run-time performances. 
Similarly, <code>-fno-init-local-zero</code> forces such
variables to be initialized to zero--when <code>SAVE</code>d (such as when
<code>-fno-automatic</code>), this by itself generally affects only
startup time for a program, but when not <code>SAVE</code>d,
it can slow down the procedure every time it is called.

<p>See <a href="#Overly%20Convenient%20Options">Overly Convenient Command-Line Options</a>,
for information on the <code>-fno-automatic</code> and
<code>-finit-local-zero</code> options and how to convert
their use into selective changes in your own code.

<h3>Avoid f2c Compatibility</h3>

<p>If you aren't linking with any code compiled using
<code>f2c</code>, try using the <code>-fno-f2c</code> option when
compiling <em>all</em> the code in your program. 
(Note that <code>libf2c</code> is <em>not</em> an example of code
that is compiled using <code>f2c</code>--it is compiled by a C
compiler, typically <code>gcc</code>.)

<br>

<h3>Use Submodel Options</h3>

<p>Using an appropriate <code>-m</code> option to generate specific code for your
CPU may be worthwhile, though it may mean the executable won't run on
other versions of the CPU that don't support the same instruction set. 
See <a href="gcc.html#Hardware%20Models%20and%20Configurations">Submodel Options</a>.  For instance on an x86 system the compiler might have
been built--as shown by <code>g77 -v</code>--for the target
<code>i386-pc-linux-gnu</code>, i.e. an <code>i386</code> CPU.  In that case to
generate code best optimized for a Pentium you could use the option
<code>-march=pentium</code>.

<p>For recent CPUs that don't have explicit support in the released version
of <code>gcc</code>, it <em>might</em> still be possible to get improvements
with certain <code>-m</code> options.

<p><code>-fomit-frame-pointer</code> can help performance on x86 systems and
others.  It will, however, inhibit debugging on the systems on which it
is not turned on anyway by <code>-O</code>.

<h1>Known Causes of Trouble with GNU Fortran</h1>

<p>This section describes known problems that affect users of GNU Fortran. 
Most of these are not GNU Fortran bugs per se--if they were, we would
fix them. 
But the result for a user might be like the result of a bug.

<p>Some of these problems are due to bugs in other software, some are
missing features that are too much work to add, and some are places
where people's opinions differ as to what is best.

<p>Information on bugs that show up when configuring, porting, building,
or installing <code>g77</code> is not provided here.

<h2>Bugs Not In GNU Fortran</h2>

<p>These are bugs to which the maintainers often have to reply,
"but that isn't a bug in <code>g77</code><small>...</small>". 
Some of these already are fixed in new versions of other
software; some still need to be fixed; some are problems
with how <code>g77</code> is installed or is being used;
some are the result of bad hardware that causes software
to misbehave in sometimes bizarre ways;
some just cannot be addressed at this time until more
is known about the problem.

<p>Please don't re-report these bugs to the <code>g77</code> maintainers--if
you must remind someone how important it is to you that the problem
be fixed, talk to the people responsible for the other products
identified below, but preferably only after you've tried the
latest versions of those products. 
The <code>g77</code> maintainers have their hands full working on
just fixing and improving <code>g77</code>, without serving as a
clearinghouse for all bugs that happen to affect <code>g77</code>
users.

<h3>Signal 11 and Friends</h3>

<p>A whole variety of strange behaviors can occur when the
software, or the way you are using the software,
stresses the hardware in a way that triggers hardware bugs. 
This might seem hard to believe, but it happens frequently
enough that there exist documents explaining in detail
what the various causes of the problems are, what
typical symptoms look like, and so on.

<p>Generally these problems are referred to in this document
as "signal 11" crashes, because the Linux kernel, running
on the most popular hardware (the Intel x86 line), often
stresses the hardware more than other popular operating
systems. 
When hardware problems do occur under GNU/Linux on x86
systems, these often manifest themselves as "signal 11"
problems, as illustrated by the following diagnostic:

<pre>sh# <kbd>g77 myprog.f</kbd>
gcc: Internal compiler error: program f771 got fatal signal 11
sh#
</pre>

<p>It is <em>very</em> important to remember that the above
message is <em>not</em> the only one that indicates a
hardware problem, nor does it always indicate a hardware
problem.

<p>In particular, on systems other than those running the Linux
kernel, the message might appear somewhat or very different,
as it will if the error manifests itself while running a
program other than the <code>g77</code> compiler. 
For example,
it will appear somewhat different when running your program,
when running Emacs, and so on.

<p>How to cope with such problems is well beyond the scope
of this manual.

<p>However, users of Linux-based systems (such as GNU/Linux)
should review <a href="http://www.bitwizard.nl/sig11/">http://www.bitwizard.nl/sig11/</a>, a source
of detailed information on diagnosing hardware problems,
by recognizing their common symptoms.

<p>Users of other operating systems and hardware might
find this reference useful as well. 
If you know of similar material for another hardware/software
combination, please let us know so we can consider including
a reference to it in future versions of this manual.

<h3>Cannot Link Fortran Programs</h3>

<p>On some systems, perhaps just those with out-of-date (shared?) 
libraries, unresolved-reference errors happen when linking <code>g77</code>-compiled
programs (which should be done using <code>g77</code>).

<p>If this happens to you, try appending <code>-lc</code> to the command you
use to link the program, e.g. <code>g77 foo.f -lc</code>. 
<code>g77</code> already specifies <code>-lg2c -lm</code> when it calls the linker,
but it cannot also specify <code>-lc</code> because not all systems have a
file named <code>libc.a</code>.

<p>It is unclear at this point whether there are legitimately installed
systems where <code>-lg2c -lm</code> is insufficient to resolve code produced
by <code>g77</code>.

<p>If your program doesn't link due to unresolved references to names
like <code>_main</code>, make sure you're using the <code>g77</code> command to do the
link, since this command ensures that the necessary libraries are
loaded by specifying <code>-lg2c -lm</code> when it invokes the <code>gcc</code>
command to do the actual link. 
(Use the <code>-v</code> option to discover
more about what actually happens when you use the <code>g77</code> and <code>gcc</code>
commands.)

<p>Also, try specifying <code>-lc</code> as the last item on the <code>g77</code>
command line, in case that helps.

<h3>Large Common Blocks</h3>

<p>On some older GNU/Linux systems, programs with common blocks larger
than 16MB cannot be linked without some kind of error
message being produced.

<p>This is a bug in older versions of <code>ld</code>, fixed in
more recent versions of <code>binutils</code>, such as version 2.6.

<h3>Debugger Problems</h3>

<p>There are some known problems when using <code>gdb</code> on code
compiled by <code>g77</code>. 
Inadequate investigation as of the release of 0.5.16 results in not
knowing which products are the culprit, but <code>gdb-4.14</code> definitely
crashes when, for example, an attempt is made to print the contents
of a <code>COMPLEX(KIND=2)</code> dummy array, on at least some GNU/Linux
machines, plus some others. 
Attempts to access assumed-size arrays are
also known to crash recent versions of <code>gdb</code>. 
(<code>gdb</code>'s Fortran support was done for a different compiler
and isn't properly compatible with <code>g77</code>.)

<h3>NeXTStep Problems</h3>

<p>Developers of Fortran code on NeXTStep (all architectures) have to
watch out for the following problem when writing programs with
large, statically allocated (i.e. non-stack based) data structures
(common blocks, saved arrays).

<p>Due to the way the native loader (<code>/bin/ld</code>) lays out
data structures in virtual memory, it is very easy to create an
executable wherein the <code>__DATA</code> segment overlaps (has addresses in
common) with the <code>UNIX STACK</code> segment.

<p>This leads to all sorts of trouble, from the executable simply not
executing, to bus errors. 
The NeXTStep command line tool <code>ebadexec</code> points to
the problem as follows:

<pre>% <kbd>/bin/ebadexec a.out</kbd>
/bin/ebadexec: __LINKEDIT segment (truncated address = 0x3de000
rounded size = 0x2a000) of executable file: a.out overlaps with UNIX
STACK segment (truncated address = 0x400000 rounded size =
0x3c00000) of executable file: a.out
</pre>

<p>(In the above case, it is the <code>__LINKEDIT</code> segment that overlaps the
stack segment.)

<p>This can be cured by assigning the <code>__DATA</code> segment
(virtual) addresses beyond the stack segment. 
A conservative
estimate for this is from address 6000000 (hexadecimal) onwards--this
has always worked for me [Toon Moene]:

<pre>% <kbd>g77 -segaddr __DATA 6000000 test.f</kbd>
% <kbd>ebadexec a.out</kbd>
ebadexec: file: a.out appears to be executable
%
</pre>

<p>Browsing through <code>egcs/gcc/f/Makefile.in</code>,
you will find that the <code>f771</code> program itself also has to be
linked with these flags--it has large statically allocated
data structures. 
(Version 0.5.18 reduces this somewhat, but probably
not enough.)

<p>(The above item was contributed by Toon Moene
(<a href="mailto:toon@moene.indiv.nluug.nl">toon@moene.indiv.nluug.nl</a>).)

<h3>Stack Overflow</h3>

<p><code>g77</code> code might fail at runtime (probably with a "segmentation
violation") due to overflowing the stack. 
This happens most often on systems with an environment
that provides substantially more heap space (for use
when arbitrarily allocating and freeing memory) than stack
space.

<p>Often this can be cured by
increasing or removing your shell's limit on stack usage, typically
using <kbd>limit stacksize</kbd> (in <code>csh</code> and derivatives) or
<kbd>ulimit -s</kbd> (in <code>sh</code> and derivatives).

<p>Increasing the allowed stack size might, however, require
changing some operating system or system configuration parameters.

<p>You might be able to work around the problem by compiling with the
<code>-fno-automatic</code> option to reduce stack usage, probably at the
expense of speed.

<p>See <a href="#Maximum%20Stackable%20Size">Maximum Stackable Size</a>, for information on patching
<code>g77</code> to use different criteria for placing local
non-automatic variables and arrays on the stack.

<p>However, if your program uses large automatic arrays
(for example, has declarations like <code>REAL A(N)</code> where
<code>A</code> is a local array and <code>N</code> is a dummy or
<code>COMMON</code> variable that can have a large value),
neither use of <code>-fno-automatic</code>,
nor changing the cut-off point for <code>g77</code> for using the stack,
will solve the problem by changing the placement of these
large arrays, as they are <em>necessarily</em> automatic.

<p><code>g77</code> currently provides no means to specify that
automatic arrays are to be allocated on the heap instead
of the stack. 
So, other than increasing the stack size, your best bet is to
change your source code to avoid large automatic arrays. 
Methods for doing this currently are outside the scope of
this document.

<p>(<em>Note:</em> If your system puts stack and heap space in the
same memory area, such that they are effectively combined, then
a stack overflow probably indicates a program that is either
simply too large for the system, or buggy.)

Up:<a rel=up href="#But-bugs">But-bugs</a>
<br>

<h3>Nothing Happens</h3>

<p>It is occasionally reported that a "simple" program,
such as a "Hello, World!" program, does nothing when
it is run, even though the compiler reported no errors,
despite the program containing nothing other than a
simple <code>PRINT</code> statement.

<p>This most often happens because the program has been
compiled and linked on a UNIX system and named <code>test</code>,
though other names can lead to similarly unexpected
run-time behavior on various systems.

<p>Essentially this problem boils down to giving
your program a name that is already known to
the shell you are using to identify some other program,
which the shell continues to execute instead of your
program when you invoke it via, for example:

<pre>sh# <kbd>test</kbd>
sh#
</pre>

<p>Under UNIX and many other system, a simple command name
invokes a searching mechanism that might well not choose
the program located in the current working directory if
there is another alternative (such as the <code>test</code>
command commonly installed on UNIX systems).

<p>The reliable way to invoke a program you just linked in
the current directory under UNIX is to specify it using
an explicit pathname, as in:

<pre>sh# <kbd>./test</kbd>
 Hello, World!
sh#
</pre>

<p>Users who encounter this problem should take the time to
read up on how their shell searches for commands, how to
set their search path, and so on. 
The relevant UNIX commands to learn about include
<code>man</code>, <code>info</code> (on GNU systems), <code>setenv</code> (or
<code>set</code> and <code>env</code>), <code>which</code>, and <code>find</code>.

<h3>Strange Behavior at Run Time</h3>

<p><code>g77</code> code might fail at runtime with "segmentation violation",
"bus error", or even something as subtle as a procedure call
overwriting a variable or array element that it is not supposed
to touch.

<p>These can be symptoms of a wide variety of actual bugs that
occurred earlier during the program's run, but manifested
themselves as <em>visible</em> problems some time later.

<p>Overflowing the bounds of an array--usually by writing beyond
the end of it--is one of two kinds of bug that often occurs
in Fortran code. 
(Compile your code with the <code>-fbounds-check</code> option
to catch many of these kinds of errors at program run time.)

<p>The other kind of bug is a mismatch between the actual arguments
passed to a procedure and the dummy arguments as declared by that
procedure.

<p>Both of these kinds of bugs, and some others as well, can be
difficult to track down, because the bug can change its behavior,
or even appear to not occur, when using a debugger.

<p>That is, these bugs can be quite sensitive to data, including
data representing the placement of other data in memory (that is,
pointers, such as the placement of stack frames in memory).

<p><code>g77</code> now offers the
ability to catch and report some of these problems at compile, link, or
run time, such as by generating code to detect references to
beyond the bounds of most arrays (except assumed-size arrays),
and checking for agreement between calling and called procedures. 
Future improvements are likely to be made in the procedure-mismatch area,
at least.

<p>In the meantime, finding and fixing the programming
bugs that lead to these behaviors is, ultimately, the user's
responsibility, as difficult as that task can sometimes be.

<p>One runtime problem that has been observed might have a simple solution. 
If a formatted <code>WRITE</code> produces an endless stream of spaces, check
that your program is linked against the correct version of the C library. 
The configuration process takes care to account for your
system's normal <code>libc</code> not being ANSI-standard, which will
otherwise cause this behaviour. 
If your system's default library is
ANSI-standard and you subsequently link against a non-ANSI one, there
might be problems such as this one.

<p>Specifically, on Solaris2 systems,
avoid picking up the <code>BSD</code> library from <code>/usr/ucblib</code>.

<br>

<h3>Floating-point Errors</h3>

<p>Some programs appear to produce inconsistent floating-point
results compiled by <code>g77</code> versus by other compilers.

<p>Often the reason for this behavior is the fact that floating-point
values are represented on almost all Fortran systems by
<em>approximations</em>, and these approximations are inexact
even for apparently simple values like 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.6,
0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.1, and so on. 
Most Fortran systems, including all current ports of <code>g77</code>,
use binary arithmetic to represent these approximations.

<p>Therefore, the exact value of any floating-point approximation
as manipulated by <code>g77</code>-compiled code is representable by
adding some combination of the values 1.0, 0.5, 0.25, 0.125, and
so on (just keep dividing by two) through the precision of the
fraction (typically around 23 bits for <code>REAL(KIND=1)</code>, 52 for
<code>REAL(KIND=2)</code>), then multiplying the sum by a integral
power of two (in Fortran, by <code>2**N</code>) that typically is between
-127 and +128 for <code>REAL(KIND=1)</code> and -1023 and +1024 for
<code>REAL(KIND=2)</code>, then multiplying by -1 if the number
is negative.

<p>So, a value like 0.2 is exactly represented in decimal--since
it is a fraction, <code>2/10</code>, with a denominator that is compatible
with the base of the number system (base 10). 
However, <code>2/10</code> cannot be represented by any finite number
of sums of any of 1.0, 0.5, 0.25, and so on, so 0.2 cannot
be exactly represented in binary notation.

<p>(On the other hand, decimal notation can represent any binary
number in a finite number of digits. 
Decimal notation cannot do so with ternary, or base-3,
notation, which would represent floating-point numbers as
sums of any of <code>1/1</code>, <code>1/3</code>, <code>1/9</code>, and so on. 
After all, no finite number of decimal digits can exactly
represent <code>1/3</code>. 
Fortunately, few systems use ternary notation.)

<p>Moreover, differences in the way run-time I/O libraries convert
between these approximations and the decimal representation often
used by programmers and the programs they write can result in
apparent differences between results that do not actually exist,
or exist to such a small degree that they usually are not worth
worrying about.

<p>For example, consider the following program:

<pre>PRINT *, 0.2
END
</pre>

<p>When compiled by <code>g77</code>, the above program might output
<code>0.20000003</code>, while another compiler might produce a
executable that outputs <code>0.2</code>.

<p>This particular difference is due to the fact that, currently,
conversion of floating-point values by the <code>libg2c</code> library,
used by <code>g77</code>, handles only double-precision values.

<p>Since <code>0.2</code> in the program is a single-precision value, it
is converted to double precision (still in binary notation)
before being converted back to decimal. 
The conversion to binary appends <em>binary</em> zero digits to the
original value--which, again, is an inexact approximation of
0.2--resulting in an approximation that is much less exact
than is connoted by the use of double precision.

<p>(The appending of binary zero digits has essentially the same
effect as taking a particular decimal approximation of
<code>1/3</code>, such as <code>0.3333333</code>, and appending decimal
zeros to it, producing <code>0.33333330000000000</code>. 
Treating the resulting decimal approximation as if it really
had 18 or so digits of valid precision would make it seem
a very poor approximation of <code>1/3</code>.)

<p>As a result of converting the single-precision approximation
to double precision by appending binary zeros, the conversion
of the resulting double-precision
value to decimal produces what looks like an incorrect
result, when in fact the result is <em>inexact</em>, and
is probably no less inaccurate or imprecise an approximation
of 0.2 than is produced by other compilers that happen to output
the converted value as "exactly" <code>0.2</code>. 
(Some compilers behave in a way that can make them appear
to retain more accuracy across a conversion of a single-precision
constant to double precision. 
See <a href="#Context-Sensitive%20Constants">Context-Sensitive Constants</a>, to see why
this practice is illusory and even dangerous.)

<p>Note that a more exact approximation of the constant is
computed when the program is changed to specify a
double-precision constant:

<pre>PRINT *, 0.2D0
END
</pre>

<p>Future versions of <code>g77</code> and/or <code>libg2c</code> might convert
single-precision values directly to decimal,
instead of converting them to double precision first. 
This would tend to result in output that is more consistent
with that produced by some other Fortran implementations.

This document explores some of the issues surrounding computing
of extended (80-bit) results on processors such as the x86,
especially when those results are arbitrarily truncated
to 32-bit or 64-bit values by the compiler
as "spills".

<p>(<em>Note:</em> <code>g77</code> specifically, and <code>gcc</code> generally,
does arbitrarily truncate 80-bit results during spills
as of this writing. 
It is not yet clear whether a future version of
the GNU compiler suite will offer 80-bit spills
as an option, or perhaps even as the default behavior.)

<p>The GNU C library provides routines for controlling the FPU, and other
documentation about this.

<h2>Known Bugs In GNU Fortran</h2>

<p>This section identifies bugs that <code>g77</code> <em>users</em>
might run into in the GCC-2.95 version
of <code>g77</code>. 
This includes bugs that are actually in the <code>gcc</code>
back end (GBE) or in <code>libf2c</code>, because those
sets of code are at least somewhat under the control
of (and necessarily intertwined with) <code>g77</code>,
so it isn't worth separating them out.

<p>For information on bugs in <em>other</em> versions of <code>g77</code>,
see <a href="#News">News About GNU Fortran</a>. 
There, lists of bugs fixed in various versions of <code>g77</code>
can help determine what bugs existed in prior versions.

<p>An online, "live" version of this document
(derived directly from the mainline, development version
of <code>g77</code> within <code>egcs</code>)
is available via
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/onlinedocs/g77_bugs.html">http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/onlinedocs/g77_bugs.html</a>. 
Follow the "Known Bugs" link.

<p>For information on bugs that might afflict people who
configure, port, build, and install <code>g77</code>,
see <a href="#Problems%20Installing">Problems Installing</a>.

<p>The following information was last updated on 1999-06-29:

<ul>
<li><code>g77</code> fails to warn about
use of a "live" iterative-DO variable
as an implied-DO variable
in a <code>WRITE</code> or <code>PRINT</code> statement
(although it does warn about this in a <code>READ</code> statement).

<li>Something about <code>g77</code>'s straightforward handling of
label references and definitions sometimes prevents the GBE
from unrolling loops. 
Until this is solved, try inserting or removing <code>CONTINUE</code>
statements as the terminal statement, using the <code>END DO</code>
form instead, and so on.

<li>Some confusion in diagnostics concerning failing <code>INCLUDE</code>
statements from within <code>INCLUDE</code>'d or <code>#include</code>'d files.

<li><code>g77</code> assumes that <code>INTEGER(KIND=1)</code> constants range
from <code>-2**31</code> to <code>2**31-1</code> (the range for
two's-complement 32-bit values),
instead of determining their range from the actual range of the
type for the configuration (and, someday, for the constant).

<p>Further, it generally doesn't implement the handling
of constants very well in that it makes assumptions about the
configuration that it no longer makes regarding variables (types).

<p>Included with this item is the fact that <code>g77</code> doesn't recognize
that, on IEEE-754/854-compliant systems, <code>0./0.</code> should produce a NaN
and no warning instead of the value <code>0.</code> and a warning. 
This is to be fixed in version 0.6, when <code>g77</code> will use the
<code>gcc</code> back end's constant-handling mechanisms to replace its own.

</p><li><code>g77</code> uses way too much memory and CPU time to process large aggregate
areas having any initialized elements.

<p>For example, <code>REAL A(1000000)</code> followed by <code>DATA A(1)/1/</code>
takes up way too much time and space, including
the size of the generated assembler file. 
This is to be mitigated somewhat in version 0.6.

<p>Version 0.5.18 improves cases like this--specifically,
cases of <em>sparse</em> initialization that leave large, contiguous
areas uninitialized--significantly. 
However, even with the improvements, these cases still
require too much memory and CPU time.

<p>(Version 0.5.18 also improves cases where the initial values are
zero to a much greater degree, so if the above example
ends with <code>DATA A(1)/0/</code>, the compile-time performance
will be about as good as it will ever get, aside from unrelated
improvements to the compiler.)

<p>Note that <code>g77</code> does display a warning message to
notify the user before the compiler appears to hang. 
See <a href="#Large%20Initialization">Initialization of Large Aggregate Areas</a>,
for information on how to change the point at which
<code>g77</code> decides to issue this warning.

</p><li><code>g77</code> doesn't emit variable and array members of common blocks for use
with a debugger (the <code>-g</code> command-line option). 
The code is present to do this, but doesn't work with at least
one debug format--perhaps it works with others. 
And it turns out there's a similar bug for
local equivalence areas, so that has been disabled as well.

<p>As of Version 0.5.19, a temporary kludge solution is provided whereby
some rudimentary information on a member is written as a string that
is the member's value as a character string.

<p>See <a href="#Code%20Gen%20Options">Options for Code Generation Conventions</a>,
for information on the <code>-fdebug-kludge</code> option.

</p><li>When debugging, after starting up the debugger but before being able
to see the source code for the main program unit, the user must currently
set a breakpoint at <code>MAIN__</code> (or <code>MAIN___</code> or <code>MAIN_</code> if
<code>MAIN__</code> doesn't exist)
and run the program until it hits the breakpoint. 
At that point, the
main program unit is activated and about to execute its first
executable statement, but that's the state in which the debugger should
start up, as is the case for languages like C.

<li>Debugging <code>g77</code>-compiled code using debuggers other than
<code>gdb</code> is likely not to work.

<p>Getting <code>g77</code> and <code>gdb</code> to work together is a known
problem--getting <code>g77</code> to work properly with other
debuggers, for which source code often is unavailable to <code>g77</code>
developers, seems like a much larger, unknown problem,
and is a lower priority than making <code>g77</code> and <code>gdb</code>
work together properly.

<p>On the other hand, information about problems other debuggers
have with <code>g77</code> output might make it easier to properly
fix <code>g77</code>, and perhaps even improve <code>gdb</code>, so it
is definitely welcome. 
Such information might even lead to all relevant products
working together properly sooner.

</p><li><code>g77</code> doesn't work perfectly on 64-bit configurations
such as the Digital Semiconductor ("DEC") Alpha.

<p>This problem is largely resolved as of version 0.5.23. 
Version 0.6 should solve most or all remaining problems
(such as cross-compiling involving 64-bit machines).

</p><li><code>g77</code> currently inserts needless padding for things like
<code>COMMON A,IPAD</code> where <code>A</code> is <code>CHARACTER*1</code> and <code>IPAD</code>
is <code>INTEGER(KIND=1)</code> on machines like x86,
because the back end insists that <code>IPAD</code>
be aligned to a 4-byte boundary,
but the processor has no such requirement
(though it is usually good for performance).

<p>The <code>gcc</code> back end needs to provide a wider array
of specifications of alignment requirements and preferences for targets,
and front ends like <code>g77</code> should take advantage of this
when it becomes available.

</p><li>The <code>libf2c</code> routines that perform some run-time
arithmetic on <code>COMPLEX</code> operands
were modified circa version 0.5.20 of <code>g77</code>
to work properly even in the presence of aliased operands.

<p>While the <code>g77</code> and <code>netlib</code> versions of <code>libf2c</code>
differ on how this is accomplished,
the main differences are that we believe
the <code>g77</code> version works properly
even in the presence of <em>partially</em> aliased operands.

<p>However, these modifications have reduced performance
on targets such as x86,
due to the extra copies of operands involved.

<h3>Better Source Model</h3>

<p><code>g77</code> needs to provide, as the default source-line model,
a "pure visual" mode, where
the interpretation of a source program in this mode can be accurately
determined by a user looking at a traditionally displayed rendition
of the program (assuming the user knows whether the program is fixed
or free form).

<p>The design should assume the user cannot tell tabs from spaces
and cannot see trailing spaces on lines, but has canonical tab stops
and, for fixed-form source, has the ability to always know exactly
where column 72 is (since the Fortran standard itself requires
this for fixed-form source).

<p>This would change the default treatment of fixed-form source
to not treat lines with tabs as if they were infinitely long--instead,
they would end at column 72 just as if the tabs were replaced
by spaces in the canonical way.

<p>As part of this, provide common alternate models (Digital, <code>f2c</code>,
and so on) via command-line options. 
This includes allowing arbitrarily long
lines for free-form source as well as fixed-form source and providing
various limits and diagnostics as appropriate.

<p>Also, <code>g77</code> should offer, perhaps even default to, warnings
when characters beyond the last valid column are anything other
than spaces. 
This would mean code with "sequence numbers" in columns 73 through 80
would be rejected, and there's a lot of that kind of code around,
but one of the most frequent bugs encountered by new users is
accidentally writing fixed-form source code into and beyond
column 73. 
So, maybe the users of old code would be able to more easily handle
having to specify, say, a <code>-Wno-col73to80</code> option.

<h3>Fortran 90 Support</h3>

<p><code>g77</code> does not support many of the features that
distinguish Fortran 90 (and, now, Fortran 95) from
ANSI FORTRAN 77.

<p>Some Fortran 90 features are supported, because they
make sense to offer even to die-hard users of F77. 
For example, many of them codify various ways F77 has
been extended to meet users' needs during its tenure,
so <code>g77</code> might as well offer them as the primary
way to meet those same needs, even if it offers compatibility
with one or more of the ways those needs were met
by other F77 compilers in the industry.

<p>Still, many important F90 features are not supported,
because no attempt has been made to research each and
every feature and assess its viability in <code>g77</code>. 
In the meantime, users who need those features must
use Fortran 90 compilers anyway, and the best approach
to adding some F90 features to GNU Fortran might well be
to fund a comprehensive project to create GNU Fortran 95.

<h3>Intrinsics in <code>PARAMETER</code> Statements</h3>

<p><code>g77</code> doesn't allow intrinsics in <code>PARAMETER</code> statements. 
This feature is considered to be absolutely vital, even though it
is not standard-conforming, and is scheduled for version 0.6.

<p>Related to this, <code>g77</code> doesn't allow non-integral
exponentiation in <code>PARAMETER</code> statements, such as
<code>PARAMETER (R=2**.25)</code>. 
It is unlikely <code>g77</code> will ever support this feature,
as doing it properly requires complete emulation of
a target computer's floating-point facilities when
building <code>g77</code> as a cross-compiler. 
But, if the <code>gcc</code> back end is enhanced to provide
such a facility, <code>g77</code> will likely use that facility
in implementing this feature soon afterwards.

<h3>Arbitrary Concatenation</h3>

<p><code>g77</code> doesn't support arbitrary operands for concatenation
in contexts where run-time allocation is required. 
For example:

<pre>SUBROUTINE X(A)
CHARACTER*(*) A
CALL FOO(A // 'suffix')

<h3><code>RECURSIVE</code> Keyword</h3>

<p><code>g77</code> doesn't support the <code>RECURSIVE</code> keyword that
F90 compilers do. 
Nor does it provide any means for compiling procedures
designed to do recursion.

<p>All recursive code can be rewritten to not use recursion,
but the result is not pretty.

<br>

<h3>Increasing Precision/Range</h3>

<p>Some compilers, such as <code>f2c</code>, have an option (<code>-r8</code>,
<code>-qrealsize=8</code> or
similar) that provides automatic treatment of <code>REAL</code>
entities such that they have twice the storage size, and
a corresponding increase in the range and precision, of what
would normally be the <code>REAL(KIND=1)</code> (default <code>REAL</code>) type. 
(This affects <code>COMPLEX</code> the same way.)

<p>They also typically offer another option (<code>-i8</code>) to increase
<code>INTEGER</code> entities so they are twice as large
(with roughly twice as much range).

<p>(There are potential pitfalls in using these options.)

<p><code>g77</code> does not yet offer any option that performs these
kinds of transformations. 
Part of the problem is the lack of detailed specifications regarding
exactly how these options affect the interpretation of constants,
intrinsics, and so on.

<p>Until <code>g77</code> addresses this need, programmers could improve
the portability of their code by modifying it to not require
compile-time options to produce correct results. 
Some free tools are available which may help, specifically
in Toolpack (which one would expect to be sound) and the <code>fortran</code>
section of the Netlib repository.

<p>Use of preprocessors can provide a fairly portable means
to work around the lack of widely portable methods in the Fortran
language itself (though increasing acceptance of Fortran 90 would
alleviate this problem).

<h3>Popular Non-standard Types</h3>

<p><code>g77</code> doesn't fully support <code>INTEGER*2</code>, <code>LOGICAL*1</code>,
and similar. 
Version 0.6 will provide full support for this very
popular set of features. 
In the meantime, version 0.5.18 provides rudimentary support
for them.

<h3>Full Support for Compiler Types</h3>

<p><code>g77</code> doesn't support <code>INTEGER</code>, <code>REAL</code>, and <code>COMPLEX</code> equivalents
for <em>all</em> applicable back-end-supported types (<code>char</code>, <code>short int</code>,
<code>int</code>, <code>long int</code>, <code>long long int</code>, and <code>long double</code>). 
This means providing intrinsic support, and maybe constant
support (using F90 syntax) as well, and, for most
machines will result in automatic support of <code>INTEGER*1</code>,
<code>INTEGER*2</code>, <code>INTEGER*8</code>, maybe even <code>REAL*16</code>,
and so on. 
This is scheduled for version 0.6.

<h3>Array Bounds Expressions</h3>

<p><code>g77</code> doesn't support more general expressions to dimension
arrays, such as array element references, function
references, etc.

<p>For example, <code>g77</code> currently does not accept the following:

<pre>SUBROUTINE X(M, N)
INTEGER N(10), M(N(2), N(1))
</pre>

Up:<a rel=up href="#Missing%20Features">Missing Features</a>
<br>

<h3>POINTER Statements</h3>

<p><code>g77</code> doesn't support pointers or allocatable objects
(other than automatic arrays). 
This set of features is
probably considered just behind intrinsics
in <code>PARAMETER</code> statements on the list of large,
important things to add to <code>g77</code>.

<p>In the meantime, consider using the <code>INTEGER(KIND=7)</code>
declaration to specify that a variable must be
able to hold a pointer. 
This construct is not portable to other non-GNU compilers,
but it is portable to all machines GNU Fortran supports
when <code>g77</code> is used.

<p>See <a href="#Functions%20and%20Subroutines">Functions and Subroutines</a>, for information on
<code>%VAL()</code>, <code>%REF()</code>, and <code>%DESCR()</code>
constructs, which are useful for passing pointers to
procedures written in languages other than Fortran.

<h3>Sensible Non-standard Constructs</h3>

<p><code>g77</code> rejects things other compilers accept,
like <code>INTRINSIC SQRT,SQRT</code>. 
As time permits in the future, some of these things that are easy for
humans to read and write and unlikely to be intended to mean something
else will be accepted by <code>g77</code> (though <code>-fpedantic</code> should
trigger warnings about such non-standard constructs).

<p>Until <code>g77</code> no longer gratuitously rejects sensible code,
you might as well fix your code
to be more standard-conforming and portable.

<p>The kind of case that is important to except from the
recommendation to change your code is one where following
good coding rules would force you to write non-standard
code that nevertheless has a clear meaning.

<p>For example, when writing an <code>INCLUDE</code> file that
defines a common block, it might be appropriate to
include a <code>SAVE</code> statement for the common block
(such as <code>SAVE /CBLOCK/</code>), so that variables
defined in the common block retain their values even
when all procedures declaring the common block become
inactive (return to their callers).

<p>However, putting <code>SAVE</code> statements in an <code>INCLUDE</code>
file would prevent otherwise standard-conforming code
from also specifying the <code>SAVE</code> statement, by itself,
to indicate that all local variables and arrays are to
have the <code>SAVE</code> attribute.

<p>For this reason, <code>g77</code> already has been changed to
allow this combination, because although the general
problem of gratuitously rejecting unambiguous and
"safe" constructs still exists in <code>g77</code>, this
particular construct was deemed useful enough that
it was worth fixing <code>g77</code> for just this case.

<p>So, while there is no need to change your code
to avoid using this particular construct, there
might be other, equally appropriate but non-standard
constructs, that you shouldn't have to stop using
just because <code>g77</code> (or any other compiler)
gratuitously rejects it.

<p>Until the general problem is solved, if you have
any such construct you believe is worthwhile
using (e.g. not just an arbitrary, redundant
specification of an attribute), please submit a
bug report with an explanation, so we can consider
fixing <code>g77</code> just for cases like yours.

<h3><code>READONLY</code> Keyword</h3>

<p>Support for <code>READONLY</code>, in <code>OPEN</code> statements,
requires <code>libg2c</code> support,
to make sure that <code>CLOSE(<small>...</small>,STATUS='DELETE')</code>
does not delete a file opened on a unit
with the <code>READONLY</code> keyword,
and perhaps to trigger a fatal diagnostic
if a <code>WRITE</code> or <code>PRINT</code>
to such a unit is attempted.

<p><em>Note:</em> It is not sufficient for <code>g77</code> and <code>libg2c</code>
(its version of <code>libf2c</code>)
to assume that <code>READONLY</code> does not need some kind of explicit support
at run time,
due to UNIX systems not (generally) needing it. 
<code>g77</code> is not just a UNIX-based compiler!

<p>Further, mounting of non-UNIX filesystems on UNIX systems
(such as via NFS)
might require proper <code>READONLY</code> support.

<p>(Similar issues might be involved with supporting the <code>SHARED</code>
keyword.)

<h3><code>FLUSH</code> Statement</h3>

<p><code>g77</code> could perhaps use a <code>FLUSH</code> statement that
does what <code>CALL FLUSH</code> does,
but that supports <code>*</code> as the unit designator (same unit as for
<code>PRINT</code>) and accepts <code>ERR=</code> and/or <code>IOSTAT=</code>
specifiers.

<h3>Expressions in <code>FORMAT</code> Statements</h3>

<p><code>g77</code> doesn't support <code>FORMAT(I&lt;J&gt;)</code> and the like. 
Supporting this requires a significant redesign or replacement
of <code>libg2c</code>.

<p>However, <code>g77</code> does support
this construct when the expression is constant
(as of version 0.5.22). 
For example:

<pre>      PARAMETER (IWIDTH = 12)
10    FORMAT (I&lt;IWIDTH&gt;)
</pre>

<p>Otherwise, at least for output (<code>PRINT</code> and
<code>WRITE</code>), Fortran code making use of this feature can
be rewritten to avoid it by constructing the <code>FORMAT</code>
string in a <code>CHARACTER</code> variable or array, then
using that variable or array in place of the <code>FORMAT</code>
statement label to do the original <code>PRINT</code> or <code>WRITE</code>.

<p>Many uses of this feature on input can be rewritten this way
as well, but not all can. 
For example, this can be rewritten:

<pre>      READ 20, I
20    FORMAT (I&lt;J&gt;)
</pre>

<p>However, this cannot, in general, be rewritten, especially
when <code>ERR=</code> and <code>END=</code> constructs are employed:

<pre>      READ 30, J, I
30    FORMAT (I&lt;J&gt;)
</pre>

<h3>Explicit Assembler Code</h3>

<p><code>g77</code> needs to provide some way, a la <code>gcc</code>, for <code>g77</code>
code to specify explicit assembler code.

<h3>Q Edit Descriptor</h3>

<p>The <code>Q</code> edit descriptor in <code>FORMAT</code>s isn't supported. 
(This is meant to get the number of characters remaining in an input record.) 
Supporting this requires a significant redesign or replacement
of <code>libg2c</code>.

<p>A workaround might be using internal I/O or the stream-based intrinsics.

<h3>Old-style PARAMETER Statements</h3>

<p><code>g77</code> doesn't accept <code>PARAMETER I=1</code>. 
Supporting this obsolete form of
the <code>PARAMETER</code> statement would not be particularly hard, as most of the
parsing code is already in place and working.

<p>Until time/money is
spent implementing it, you might as well fix your code to use the
standard form, <code>PARAMETER (I=1)</code> (possibly needing
<code>INTEGER I</code> preceding the <code>PARAMETER</code> statement as well,
otherwise, in the obsolete form of <code>PARAMETER</code>, the
type of the variable is set from the type of the constant being
assigned to it).

<h3><code>TYPE</code> and <code>ACCEPT</code> I/O Statements</h3>

<p><code>g77</code> doesn't support the I/O statements <code>TYPE</code> and
<code>ACCEPT</code>. 
These are common extensions that should be easy to support,
but also are fairly easy to work around in user code.

<p>Generally, any <code>TYPE fmt,list</code> I/O statement can be replaced
by <code>PRINT fmt,list</code>. 
And, any <code>ACCEPT fmt,list</code> statement can be
replaced by <code>READ fmt,list</code>.

<h3><code>STRUCTURE</code>, <code>UNION</code>, <code>RECORD</code>, <code>MAP</code></h3>

<p><code>g77</code> doesn't support <code>STRUCTURE</code>, <code>UNION</code>, <code>RECORD</code>,
<code>MAP</code>. 
This set of extensions is quite a bit
lower on the list of large, important things to add to <code>g77</code>, partly
because it requires a great deal of work either upgrading or
replacing <code>libg2c</code>.

<h3><code>OPEN</code>, <code>CLOSE</code>, and <code>INQUIRE</code> Keywords</h3>

<p><code>g77</code> doesn't have support for keywords such as <code>DISP='DELETE'</code> in
the <code>OPEN</code>, <code>CLOSE</code>, and <code>INQUIRE</code> statements. 
These extensions are easy to add to <code>g77</code> itself, but
require much more work on <code>libg2c</code>.

<p><code>g77</code> doesn't support <code>FORM='PRINT'</code> or an equivalent to
translate the traditional `carriage control' characters in column 1 of
output to use backspaces, carriage returns and the like.  However
programs exist to translate them in output files (or standard output). 
These are typically called either <code>fpr</code> or <code>asa</code>.  You can get
a version of <code>asa</code> from
<a href="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/devel/lang/fortran">ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/devel/lang/fortran</a> for GNU
systems which will probably build easily on other systems. 
Alternatively, <code>fpr</code> is in BSD distributions in various archive
sites.

<h3><code>ENCODE</code> and <code>DECODE</code></h3>

<p><code>g77</code> doesn't support <code>ENCODE</code> or <code>DECODE</code>.

<p>These statements are best replaced by READ and WRITE statements
involving internal files (CHARACTER variables and arrays).

<p>For example, replace a code fragment like

<pre>      INTEGER*1 LINE(80)
<small>...</small>
      DECODE (80, 9000, LINE) A, B, C
<small>...</small>
9000  FORMAT (1X, 3(F10.5))
</pre>

<p>with:

<pre>      CHARACTER*80 LINE
<small>...</small>
      READ (UNIT=LINE, FMT=9000) A, B, C
<small>...</small>
9000  FORMAT (1X, 3(F10.5))
</pre>

<p>Similarly, replace a code fragment like

<pre>      INTEGER*1 LINE(80)
<small>...</small>
      ENCODE (80, 9000, LINE) A, B, C
<small>...</small>
9000  FORMAT (1X, 'OUTPUT IS ', 3(F10.5))
</pre>

<p>with:

<pre>      CHARACTER*80 LINE
<small>...</small>
      WRITE (UNIT=LINE, FMT=9000) A, B, C
<small>...</small>
9000  FORMAT (1X, 'OUTPUT IS ', 3(F10.5))
</pre>

<p>It is entirely possible that <code>ENCODE</code> and <code>DECODE</code> will
be supported by a future version of <code>g77</code>.

<h3><code>AUTOMATIC</code> Statement</h3>

<p><code>g77</code> doesn't support the <code>AUTOMATIC</code> statement that
<code>f2c</code> does.

<p><code>AUTOMATIC</code> would identify a variable or array
as not being <code>SAVE</code>'d, which is normally the default,
but which would be especially useful for code that, <em>generally</em>,
needed to be compiled with the <code>-fno-automatic</code> option.

<p><code>AUTOMATIC</code> also would serve as a hint to the compiler that placing
the variable or array--even a very large array-on the stack is acceptable.

<p><code>AUTOMATIC</code> would not, by itself, designate the containing procedure
as recursive.

<p><code>AUTOMATIC</code> should work syntactically like <code>SAVE</code>,
in that <code>AUTOMATIC</code> with no variables listed should apply to
all pertinent variables and arrays
(which would not include common blocks or their members).

<p>Variables and arrays denoted as <code>AUTOMATIC</code>
would not be permitted to be initialized via <code>DATA</code>
or other specification of any initial values,
requiring explicit initialization,
such as via assignment statements.

<p>Perhaps <code>UNSAVE</code> and <code>STATIC</code>,
as strict semantic opposites to <code>SAVE</code> and <code>AUTOMATIC</code>,
should be provided as well.

<h3>Suppressing Space Padding of Source Lines</h3>

<p><code>g77</code> should offer VXT-Fortran-style suppression of virtual
spaces at the end of a source line
if an appropriate command-line option is specified.

<p>This affects cases where
a character constant is continued onto the next line in a fixed-form
source file, as in the following example:

<pre>10    PRINT *,'HOW MANY
     1 SPACES?'
</pre>

<p><code>g77</code>, and many other compilers, virtually extend
the continued line through column 72 with spaces that become part
of the character constant, but Digital Fortran normally didn't,
leaving only one space between <code>MANY</code> and <code>SPACES?</code>
in the output of the above statement.

<p>Fairly recently, at least one version of Digital Fortran
was enhanced to provide the other behavior when a
command-line option is specified, apparently due to demand
from readers of the USENET group <code>comp.lang.fortran</code>
to offer conformance to this widespread practice in the
industry. 
<code>g77</code> should return the favor by offering conformance
to Digital's approach to handling the above example.

<h3>Fortran Preprocessor</h3>

<p><code>g77</code> should offer a preprocessor designed specifically
for Fortran to replace <code>cpp -traditional</code>. 
There are several out there worth evaluating, at least.

<p>Such a preprocessor would recognize Hollerith constants,
properly parse comments and character constants, and so on. 
It might also recognize, process, and thus preprocess
files included via the <code>INCLUDE</code> directive.

<h3>Bit Operations on Floating-point Data</h3>

<p><code>g77</code> does not allow <code>REAL</code> and other non-integral types for
arguments to intrinsics like <code>And</code>, <code>Or</code>, and <code>Shift</code>.

<p>For example, this program is rejected by <code>g77</code>, because
the intrinsic <code>Iand</code> does not accept <code>REAL</code> arguments:

<pre>DATA A/7.54/, B/9.112/
PRINT *, IAND(A, B)

<h3>Floating-point Exception Handling</h3>

<p>The <code>gcc</code> backend and, consequently, <code>g77</code>, currently provides no
general control over whether or not floating-point exceptions are trapped or
ignored. 
(Ignoring them typically results in NaN values being
propagated in systems that conform to IEEE 754.) 
The behaviour is normally inherited from the system-dependent startup
code, though some targets, such as the Alpha, have code generation
options which change the behaviour.

<p>Most systems provide some C-callable mechanism to change this; this can
be invoked at startup using <code>gcc</code>'s <code>constructor</code> attribute. 
For example, just compiling and linking the following C code with your
program will turn on exception trapping for the "common" exceptions
on an x86-based GNU system:

<pre>#include &lt;fpu_control.h&gt;
static void __attribute__ ((constructor))
trapfpe ()
{
  __setfpucw (_FPU_DEFAULT &amp;
              ~(_FPU_MASK_IM | _FPU_MASK_ZM | _FPU_MASK_OM));
}
</pre>

<p>A convenient trick is to compile this something like:
<pre>gcc -o libtrapfpe.a trapfpe.c
</pre>
and then use it by adding <code>-trapfpe</code> to the <code>g77</code> command line
when linking.

<h3>Nonportable Conversions</h3>

is type <code>REAL</code>), that other compilers might
quietly accept.

<p>Some of these conversions are accepted by <code>g77</code>
when the <code>-fugly-logint</code> option is specified. 
Perhaps it should accept more or all of them.

<h3>Large Automatic Arrays</h3>

(other than the instruction-level parallelism available on some
processors).

<p>Currently, the above is not flagged as a case of
using an uninitialized variable,
because <code>g77</code> generates a run-time library call that looks,
to the GBE, like it might actually <em>modify</em> <code>A</code> at run time. 
(And, in fact, depending on the previous run-time library call,
it would!)

<p>Fixing this requires one of the following:

<ul>
<li>Switch to new library, <code>libg77</code>, that provides
a more "clean" interface,
vis-a-vis input, output, and modified arguments,
so the GBE can tell what's going on.

<p>This would provide a pretty big performance improvement,
at least theoretically, and, ultimately, in practice,
for some types of code.

</p><li>Have <code>g77</code> pass a pointer to a temporary
containing a copy of <code>A</code>,
instead of to <code>A</code> itself. 
The GBE would then complain about the copy operation
involving a potentially uninitialized variable.

<p>This might also provide a performance boost for some code,
because <code>A</code> might then end up living in a register,
which could help with inner loops.

</p><li>Have <code>g77</code> use a GBE construct similar to <code>ADDR_EXPR</code>
but with extra information on the fact that the
item pointed to won't be modified
(a la <code>const</code> in C).

<p>Probably the best solution for now, but not quite trivial
to implement in the general case. 
Worth considering after <code>g77</code> 0.6 is considered
pretty solid. 
</ul>

<h3>Gracefully Handle Sensible Bad Code</h3>

<p><code>g77</code> generally should continue processing for
warnings and recoverable (user) errors whenever possible--that
is, it shouldn't gratuitously make bad or useless code.

<p>For example:

<pre>INTRINSIC ZABS
CALL FOO(ZABS)
END
</pre>

<p>When compiling the above with <code>-ff2c-intrinsics-disable</code>,
<code>g77</code> should indeed complain about passing <code>ZABS</code>,
but it still should compile, instead of rejecting
the entire <code>CALL</code> statement. 
(Some of this is related to improving
the compiler internals to improve how statements are analyzed.)

<h3>Non-standard Conversions</h3>

<p><code>-Wconversion</code> and related should flag places where non-standard
conversions are found. 
Perhaps much of this would be part of <code>-Wugly*</code>.

<h3>Non-standard Intrinsics</h3>

<p><code>g77</code> needs a new option, like <code>-Wintrinsics</code>, to warn about use of
non-standard intrinsics without explicit <code>INTRINSIC</code> statements for them. 
This would help find code that might fail silently when ported to another
compiler.

<h3>Modifying <code>DO</code> Variable</h3>

<p><code>g77</code> should warn about modifying <code>DO</code> variables
via <code>EQUIVALENCE</code>. 
(The internal information gathered to produce this warning
might also be useful in setting the
internal "doiter" flag for a variable or even array
reference within a loop, since that might produce faster code someday.)

<p>For example, this code is invalid, so <code>g77</code> should warn about
the invalid assignment to <code>NOTHER</code>:

<pre>EQUIVALENCE (I, NOTHER)
DO I = 1, 100
   IF (I.EQ. 10) NOTHER = 20
END DO
</pre>

<h3>Better Pedantic Compilation</h3>

<p><code>g77</code> needs to support <code>-fpedantic</code> more thoroughly,
and use it only to generate
warnings instead of rejecting constructs outright. 
Have it warn:
if a variable that dimensions an array is not a dummy or placed
explicitly in <code>COMMON</code> (F77 does not allow it to be
placed in <code>COMMON</code> via <code>EQUIVALENCE</code>); if specification statements
follow statement-function-definition statements; about all sorts of
syntactic extensions.

<h3>Warn About Implicit Conversions</h3>

<p><code>g77</code> needs a <code>-Wpromotions</code> option to warn if source code appears
to expect automatic, silent, and
somewhat dangerous compiler-assisted conversion of <code>REAL(KIND=1)</code>
constants to <code>REAL(KIND=2)</code> based on context.

<p>For example, it would warn about cases like this:

<pre>DOUBLE PRECISION FOO
PARAMETER (TZPHI = 9.435784839284958)
FOO = TZPHI * 3D0
</pre>

<h3>Invalid Use of Hollerith Constant</h3>

<p><code>g77</code> should disallow statements like <code>RETURN 2HAB</code>,
which are invalid in both source forms
(unlike <code>RETURN (2HAB)</code>,
which probably still makes no sense but at least can
be reliably parsed). 
Fixed-form processing rejects it, but not free-form, except
in a way that is a bit difficult to understand.

<h3>Dummy Array Without Dimensioning Dummy</h3>

<p><code>g77</code> should complain when a list of dummy arguments containing an
adjustable dummy array does
not also contain every variable listed in the dimension list of the
adjustable array.

<p>Currently, <code>g77</code> does complain about a variable that
dimensions an array but doesn't appear in any dummy list or <code>COMMON</code>
area, but this needs to be extended to catch cases where it doesn't appear in
every dummy list that also lists any arrays it dimensions.

<p>For example, <code>g77</code> should warn about the entry point <code>ALT</code>
below, since it includes <code>ARRAY</code> but not <code>ISIZE</code> in its
list of arguments:

<pre>SUBROUTINE PRIMARY(ARRAY, ISIZE)
REAL ARRAY(ISIZE)
ENTRY ALT(ARRAY)
</pre>

<br>

<h3>Invalid FORMAT Specifiers</h3>

<p><code>g77</code> should check <code>FORMAT</code> specifiers for validity
as it does <code>FORMAT</code> statements.

<p>For example, a diagnostic would be produced for:

<pre>PRINT 'HI THERE!'  !User meant PRINT *, 'HI THERE!'

<h3>Ambiguous Dialects</h3>

<p><code>g77</code> needs a set of options such as <code>-Wugly*</code>, <code>-Wautomatic</code>,
<code>-Wvxt</code>, <code>-Wf90</code>, and so on. 
These would warn about places in the user's source where ambiguities
are found, helpful in resolving ambiguities in the program's
dialect or dialects.

<h3>Informational Messages</h3>

<p><code>g77</code> needs an option to suppress information messages (notes). 
<code>-w</code> does this but also suppresses warnings. 
The default should be to suppress info messages.

<p>Perhaps info messages should simply be eliminated.

<h3>Uninitialized Variables at Run Time</h3>

<p><code>g77</code> needs an option to initialize everything (not otherwise
explicitly initialized) to "weird"
(machine-dependent) values, e.g. NaNs, bad (non-<code>NULL</code>) pointers, and
largest-magnitude integers, would help track down references to
some kinds of uninitialized variables at run time.

<p>Note that use of the options <code>-O -Wuninitialized</code> can catch
many such bugs at compile time.

<h3>Portable Unformatted Files</h3>

<p><code>g77</code> has no facility for exchanging unformatted files with systems
using different number formats--even differing only in endianness (byte
order)--or written by other compilers.  Some compilers provide
facilities at least for doing byte-swapping during unformatted I/O.

<p>It is unrealistic to expect to cope with exchanging unformatted files
with arbitrary other compiler runtimes, but the <code>g77</code> runtime
should at least be able to read files written by <code>g77</code> on systems
with different number formats, particularly if they differ only in byte
order.

<p>In case you do need to write a program to translate to or from
<code>g77</code> (<code>libf2c</code>) unformatted files, they are written as
follows:
<dl>
<dt>Sequential
<dd>Unformatted sequential records consist of
<ol type=1 start=1>
</p><li>A number giving the length of the record contents;
<li>the length of record contents again (for backspace).
</ol>

<p>The record length is of C type
<code>long</code>; this means that it is 8 bytes on 64-bit systems such as
Alpha GNU/Linux and 4 bytes on other systems, such as x86 GNU/Linux. 
Consequently such files cannot be exchanged between 64-bit and 32-bit
systems, even with the same basic number format. 
<br><dt>Direct access
<dd>Unformatted direct access files form a byte stream of length
<var>records</var>*<var>recl</var> bytes, where <var>records</var> is the maximum
record number (<code>REC=<var>records</var></code>) written and <var>recl</var> is the
record length in bytes specified in the <code>OPEN</code> statement
(<code>RECL=<var>recl</var></code>).  Data appear in the records as determined by
the relevant <code>WRITE</code> statement.  Dummy records with arbitrary
contents appear in the file in place of records which haven't been
written. 
</dl>

<p>Thus for exchanging a sequential or direct access unformatted file
between big- and little-endian 32-bit systems using IEEE 754 floating
point it would be sufficient to reverse the bytes in consecutive words
in the file if, and <em>only</em> if, only <code>REAL*4</code>, <code>COMPLEX</code>,
<code>INTEGER*4</code> and/or <code>LOGICAL*4</code> data have been written to it by
<code>g77</code>.

<p>If necessary, it is possible to do byte-oriented i/o with <code>g77</code>'s
<code>FGETC</code> and <code>FPUTC</code> intrinsics.  Byte-swapping can be done in
Fortran by equivalencing larger sized variables to an <code>INTEGER*1</code>
array or a set of scalars.

<p>If you need to exchange binary data between arbitrary system and
compiler variations, we recommend using a portable binary format with
Fortran bindings, such as NCSA's HDF (<a href="http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/">http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/</a>)
or PACT's PDB<a rel=footnote href="#fn-3"><sup>3</sup></a>
(<a href="http://www.llnl.gov/def_sci/pact/pact_homepage.html">http://www.llnl.gov/def_sci/pact/pact_homepage.html</a>).  (Unlike,
say, CDF or XDR, HDF-like systems write in the native number formats and
only incur overhead when they are read on a system with a different
format.)  A future <code>g77</code> runtime library should use such
techniques.

<h3>Better List-directed I/O</h3>

<p>Values output using list-directed I/O
(<code>PRINT *, R, D</code>)
should be written with a field width, precision, and so on
appropriate for the type (precision) of each value.

<p>(Currently, no distinction is made between single-precision
and double-precision values
by <code>libf2c</code>.)

<p>It is likely this item will require the <code>libg77</code> project
to be undertaken.

<p>In the meantime, use of formatted I/O is recommended. 
While it might be of little consolation,
<code>g77</code> does support <code>FORMAT(F&lt;WIDTH&gt;.4)</code>, for example,
as long as <code>WIDTH</code> is defined as a named constant
(via <code>PARAMETER</code>). 
That at least allows some compile-time specification
of the precision of a data type,
perhaps controlled by preprocessing directives.

<h3>Default to Console I/O</h3>

<p>The default I/O units,
specified by <code>READ <var>fmt</var></code>,
<code>READ (UNIT=*)</code>,
<code>WRITE (UNIT=*)</code>, and
<code>PRINT <var>fmt</var></code>,
should not be units 5 (input) and 6 (output),
but, rather, unit numbers not normally available
for use in statements such as <code>OPEN</code> and <code>CLOSE</code>.

<p>Changing this would allow a program to connect units 5 and 6
to files via <code>OPEN</code>,
but still use <code>READ (UNIT=*)</code> and <code>PRINT</code>
to do I/O to the "console".

<p>This change probably requires the <code>libg77</code> project.

<h3>Labels Visible to Debugger</h3>

<h3>Mangling of Names in Source Code</h3>

<p>The current external-interface design, which includes naming of
external procedures, COMMON blocks, and the library interface,
has various usability problems, including things like adding
underscores where not really necessary (and preventing easier
inter-language operability) and yet not providing complete
namespace freedom for user C code linked with Fortran apps (due
to the naming of functions in the library, among other things).

<p>Project GNU should at least get all this "right" for systems
it fully controls, such as the Hurd, and provide defaults and
options for compatibility with existing systems and interoperability
with popular existing compilers.

<h3>Multiple Definitions of External Names</h3>

<p><code>g77</code> doesn't allow a common block and an external procedure or
<code>BLOCK DATA</code> to have the same name. 
Some systems allow this, but <code>g77</code> does not,
to be compatible with <code>f2c</code>.

<p><code>g77</code> could special-case the way it handles
<code>BLOCK DATA</code>, since it is not compatible with <code>f2c</code> in this
particular area (necessarily, since <code>g77</code> offers an
important feature here), but
it is likely that such special-casing would be very annoying to people
with programs that use <code>EXTERNAL FOO</code>, with no other mention of
<code>FOO</code> in the same program unit, to refer to external procedures, since
the result would be that <code>g77</code> would treat these references as requests to
force-load BLOCK DATA program units.

<p>In that case, if <code>g77</code> modified
names of <code>BLOCK DATA</code> so they could have the same names as
<code>COMMON</code>, users
would find that their programs wouldn't link because the <code>FOO</code> procedure
didn't have its name translated the same way.

<p>(Strictly speaking,
<code>g77</code> could emit a null-but-externally-satisfying definition of
<code>FOO</code> with its name transformed as if it had been a
<code>BLOCK DATA</code>, but that probably invites more trouble than it's
worth.)

<h3>Backslash in Constants</h3>

<p>In the opinion of many experienced Fortran users,
<code>-fno-backslash</code> should be the default, not <code>-fbackslash</code>,
as currently set by <code>g77</code>.

<p>First of all, you can always specify
<code>-fno-backslash</code> to turn off this processing.

<p>Despite not being within the spirit (though apparently within the
letter) of the ANSI FORTRAN 77 standard, <code>g77</code> defaults to
<code>-fbackslash</code> because that is what most UNIX <code>f77</code> commands
default to, and apparently lots of code depends on this feature.

<p>This is a particularly troubling issue. 
The use of a C construct in the midst of Fortran code
is bad enough, worse when it makes existing Fortran
programs stop working (as happens when programs written
for non-UNIX systems are ported to UNIX systems with
compilers that provide the <code>-fbackslash</code> feature
as the default--sometimes with no option to turn it off).

<p>The author of GNU Fortran wished, for reasons of linguistic
purity, to make <code>-fno-backslash</code> the default for GNU
Fortran and thus require users of UNIX <code>f77</code> and <code>f2c</code>
to specify <code>-fbackslash</code> to get the UNIX behavior.

<p>However, the realization that <code>g77</code> is intended as
a replacement for <em>UNIX</em> <code>f77</code>, caused the author
to choose to make <code>g77</code> as compatible with
<code>f77</code> as feasible, which meant making <code>-fbackslash</code>
the default.

<p>The primary focus on compatibility is at the source-code
level, and the question became "What will users expect
a replacement for <code>f77</code> to do, by default?" 
Although at least one UNIX <code>f77</code> does not provide
<code>-fbackslash</code> as a default, it appears that
the majority of them do, which suggests that
the majority of code that is compiled by UNIX <code>f77</code>
compilers expects <code>-fbackslash</code> to be the default.

<p>It is probably the case that more code exists
that would <em>not</em> work with <code>-fbackslash</code>
in force than code that requires it be in force.

<p>However, most of <em>that</em> code is not being compiled
with <code>f77</code>,
and when it is, new build procedures (shell scripts,
makefiles, and so on) must be set up anyway so that
they work under UNIX. 
That makes a much more natural and safe opportunity for
non-UNIX users to adapt their build procedures for
<code>g77</code>'s default of <code>-fbackslash</code> than would
exist for the majority of UNIX <code>f77</code> users who
would have to modify existing, working build procedures
to explicitly specify <code>-fbackslash</code> if that was
not the default.

<p>One suggestion has been to configure the default for
<code>-fbackslash</code> (and perhaps other options as well)
based on the configuration of <code>g77</code>.

<p>This is technically quite straightforward, but will be avoided
even in cases where not configuring defaults to be
dependent on a particular configuration greatly inconveniences
some users of legacy code.

<p>Many users appreciate the GNU compilers because they provide an
environment that is uniform across machines. 
These users would be
inconvenienced if the compiler treated things like the
format of the source code differently on certain machines.

<p>Occasionally users write programs intended only for a particular machine
type. 
On these occasions, the users would benefit if the GNU Fortran compiler
were to support by default the same dialect as the other compilers on
that machine. 
But such applications are rare. 
And users writing a
program to run on more than one type of machine cannot possibly benefit
from this kind of compatibility. 
(This is consistent with the design goals for <code>gcc</code>. 
To change them for <code>g77</code>, you must first change them
for <code>gcc</code>. 
Do not ask the maintainers of <code>g77</code> to do this for you,
or to disassociate <code>g77</code> from the widely understood, if
not widely agreed-upon, goals for GNU compilers in general.)

<p>This is why GNU Fortran does and will treat backslashes in the same
fashion on all types of machines (by default). 
See <a href="#Direction%20of%20Language%20Development">Direction of Language Development</a>, for more information on
this overall philosophy guiding the development of the GNU Fortran
language.

<p>Of course, users strongly concerned about portability should indicate
explicitly in their build procedures which options are expected
by their source code, or write source code that has as few such
expectations as possible.

<p>For example, avoid writing code that depends on backslash (<code>\</code>)
being interpreted either way in particular, such as by
starting a program unit with:

<pre>CHARACTER BACKSL
PARAMETER (BACKSL = '\\')
</pre>

<p>Then, use concatenation of <code>BACKSL</code> anyplace a backslash
is desired. 
In this way, users can write programs which have the same meaning
in many Fortran dialects.

<p>(However, this technique does not work for Hollerith constants--which
is just as well, since the only generally portable uses for Hollerith
constants are in places where character constants can and should
be used instead, for readability.)

<h3>Initializing Before Specifying</h3>

<p><code>g77</code> does not allow <code>DATA VAR/1/</code> to appear in the
source code before <code>COMMON VAR</code>,
<code>DIMENSION VAR(10)</code>, <code>INTEGER VAR</code>, and so on. 
In general, <code>g77</code> requires initialization of a variable
or array to be specified <em>after</em> all other specifications
of attributes (type, size, placement, and so on) of that variable
or array are specified (though <em>confirmation</em> of data type is
permitted).

<p>It is <em>possible</em> <code>g77</code> will someday allow all of this,
even though it is not allowed by the FORTRAN 77 standard.

<p>Then again, maybe it is better to have
<code>g77</code> always require placement of <code>DATA</code>
so that it can possibly immediately write constants
to the output file, thus saving time and space.

<p>That is, <code>DATA A/1000000*1/</code> should perhaps always
be immediately writable to canonical assembler, unless it's already known
to be in a <code>COMMON</code> area following as-yet-uninitialized stuff,
and to do this it cannot be followed by <code>COMMON A</code>.

<br>

<h3>Context-Sensitive Intrinsicness</h3>

<p><code>g77</code> treats procedure references to <em>possible</em> intrinsic
names as always enabling their intrinsic nature, regardless of
whether the <em>form</em> of the reference is valid for that
intrinsic.

<p>For example, <code>CALL SQRT</code> is interpreted by <code>g77</code> as
an invalid reference to the <code>SQRT</code> intrinsic function,
because the reference is a subroutine invocation.

<p>First, <code>g77</code> recognizes the statement <code>CALL SQRT</code>
as a reference to a <em>procedure</em> named <code>SQRT</code>, not
to a <em>variable</em> with that name (as it would for a statement
such as <code>V = SQRT</code>).

<p>Next, <code>g77</code> establishes that, in the program unit being compiled,
<code>SQRT</code> is an intrinsic--not a subroutine that
happens to have the same name as an intrinsic (as would be
the case if, for example, <code>EXTERNAL SQRT</code> was present).

<p>Finally, <code>g77</code> recognizes that the <em>form</em> of the
reference is invalid for that particular intrinsic. 
That is, it recognizes that it is invalid for an intrinsic
<em>function</em>, such as <code>SQRT</code>, to be invoked as
a <em>subroutine</em>.

<p>At that point, <code>g77</code> issues a diagnostic.

<p>Some users claim that it is "obvious" that <code>CALL SQRT</code>
references an external subroutine of their own, not an
intrinsic function.

<p>However, <code>g77</code> knows about intrinsic
subroutines, not just functions, and is able to support both having
the same names, for example.

<p>As a result of this, <code>g77</code> rejects calls
to intrinsics that are not subroutines, and function invocations
of intrinsics that are not functions, just as it (and most compilers)
rejects invocations of intrinsics with the wrong number (or types)
of arguments.

<p>So, use the <code>EXTERNAL SQRT</code> statement in a program unit that calls
a user-written subroutine named <code>SQRT</code>.

Up:<a rel=up href="#Non-bugs">Non-bugs</a>
<br>

<h3>Context-Sensitive Constants</h3>

<p><code>g77</code> does not use context to determine the types of
constants or named constants (<code>PARAMETER</code>), except
for (non-standard) typeless constants such as <code>'123'O</code>.

<p>For example, consider the following statement:

<pre>PRINT *, 9.435784839284958 * 2D0
</pre>

<p><code>g77</code> will interpret the (truncated) constant
<code>9.435784839284958</code> as a <code>REAL(KIND=1)</code>, not <code>REAL(KIND=2)</code>,
constant, because the suffix <code>D0</code> is not specified.

<p>As a result, the output of the above statement when
compiled by <code>g77</code> will appear to have "less precision"
than when compiled by other compilers.

<p>In these and other cases, some compilers detect the
fact that a single-precision constant is used in
a double-precision context and therefore interpret the
single-precision constant as if it was <em>explicitly</em>
specified as a double-precision constant. 
(This has the effect of appending <em>decimal</em>, not
<em>binary</em>, zeros to the fractional part of the
number--producing different computational results.)

<p>The reason this misfeature is dangerous is that a slight,
apparently innocuous change to the source code can change
the computational results. 
Consider:

<pre>REAL ALMOST, CLOSE
DOUBLE PRECISION FIVE
PARAMETER (ALMOST = 5.000000000001)
FIVE = 5
CLOSE = 5.000000000001
PRINT *, 5.000000000001 - FIVE
PRINT *, ALMOST - FIVE
PRINT *, CLOSE - FIVE
END
</pre>

<p>Running the above program should
result in the same value being
printed three times. 
With <code>g77</code> as the compiler,
it does.

<p>However, compiled by many other compilers,
running the above program would print
two or three distinct values, because
in two or three of the statements, the
constant <code>5.000000000001</code>, which
on most systems is exactly equal to <code>5.</code>
when interpreted as a single-precision constant,
is instead interpreted as a double-precision
constant, preserving the represented
precision. 
However, this "clever" promotion of
type does not extend to variables or,
in some compilers, to named constants.

<p>Since programmers often are encouraged to replace manifest
constants or permanently-assigned variables with named
constants (<code>PARAMETER</code> in Fortran), and might need
to replace some constants with variables having the same
values for pertinent portions of code,
it is important that compilers treat code so modified in the
same way so that the results of such programs are the same. 
<code>g77</code> helps in this regard by treating constants just
the same as variables in terms of determining their types
in a context-independent way.

<p>Still, there is a lot of existing Fortran code that has
been written to depend on the way other compilers freely
interpret constants' types based on context, so anything
<code>g77</code> can do to help flag cases of this in such code
could be very helpful.

<br>

<h3>Equivalence Versus Equality</h3>

<p>Use of <code>.EQ.</code> and <code>.NE.</code> on <code>LOGICAL</code> operands
is not supported, except via <code>-fugly-logint</code>, which is not
recommended except for legacy code (where the behavior expected
by the <em>code</em> is assumed).

<p>Legacy code should be changed, as resources permit, to use <code>.EQV.</code>
and <code>.NEQV.</code> instead, as these are permitted by the various
Fortran standards.

<p>New code should never be written expecting <code>.EQ.</code> or <code>.NE.</code>
to work if either of its operands is <code>LOGICAL</code>.

<p>The problem with supporting this "feature" is that there is
unlikely to be consensus on how it works, as illustrated by the
following sample program:

<pre>LOGICAL L,M,N
DATA L,M,N /3*.FALSE./
IF (L.AND.M.EQ.N) PRINT *,'L.AND.M.EQ.N'
END
</pre>

<p>The issue raised by the above sample program is: what is the
precedence of <code>.EQ.</code> (and <code>.NE.</code>) when applied to
<code>LOGICAL</code> operands?

<p>Some programmers will argue that it is the same as the precedence
for <code>.EQ.</code> when applied to numeric (such as <code>INTEGER</code>)
operands. 
By this interpretation, the subexpression <code>M.EQ.N</code> must be
evaluated first in the above program, resulting in a program that,
when run, does not execute the <code>PRINT</code> statement.

<p>Other programmers will argue that the precedence is the same as
the precedence for <code>.EQV.</code>, which is restricted by the standards
to <code>LOGICAL</code> operands. 
By this interpretation, the subexpression <code>L.AND.M</code> must be
evaluated first, resulting in a program that <em>does</em> execute
the <code>PRINT</code> statement.

<p>Assigning arbitrary semantic interpretations to syntactic expressions
that might legitimately have more than one "obvious" interpretation
is generally unwise.

<p>The creators of the various Fortran standards have done a good job
in this case, requiring a distinct set of operators (which have their
own distinct precedence) to compare <code>LOGICAL</code> operands. 
This requirement results in expression syntax with more certain
precedence (without requiring substantial context), making it easier
for programmers to read existing code. 
<code>g77</code> will avoid muddying up elements of the Fortran language
that were well-designed in the first place.

<p>(Ask C programmers about the precedence of expressions such as
<code>(a) &amp; (b)</code> and <code>(a) - (b)</code>--they cannot even tell
you, without knowing more context, whether the <code>&amp;</code> and <code>-</code>
operators are infix (binary) or unary!)

<p>Most dangerous of all is the fact that,
even assuming consensus on its meaning,
an expression like <code>L.AND.M.EQ.N</code>,
if it is the result of a typographical error,
doesn't <em>look</em> like it has such a typo. 
Even experienced Fortran programmers would not likely notice that
<code>L.AND.M.EQV.N</code> was, in fact, intended.

<p>So, this is a prime example of a circumstance in which
a quality compiler diagnoses the code,
instead of leaving it up to someone debugging it
to know to turn on special compiler options
that might diagnose it.

Up:<a rel=up href="#Non-bugs">Non-bugs</a>
<br>

<h3>Order of Side Effects</h3>

<p><code>g77</code> does not necessarily produce code that, when run, performs
side effects (such as those performed by function invocations)
in the same order as in some other compiler--or even in the same
order as another version, port, or invocation (using different
command-line options) of <code>g77</code>.

<p>It is never safe to depend on the order of evaluation of side effects. 
For example, an expression like this may very well behave differently
from one compiler to another:

<pre>J = IFUNC() - IFUNC()
</pre>

<p>There is no guarantee that <code>IFUNC</code> will be evaluated in any particular
order. 
Either invocation might happen first. 
If <code>IFUNC</code> returns 5 the first time it is invoked, and
returns 12 the second time, <code>J</code> might end up with the
value <code>7</code>, or it might end up with <code>-7</code>.

<p>Generally, in Fortran, procedures with side-effects intended to
be visible to the caller are best designed as <em>subroutines</em>,
not functions. 
Examples of such side-effects include:

<ul>
<li>The generation of random numbers
that are intended to influence return values.

<li>Performing I/O
(other than internal I/O to local variables).

<li>Updating information in common blocks. 
</ul>

<p>An example of a side-effect that is not intended to be visible
to the caller is a function that maintains a cache of recently
calculated results, intended solely to speed repeated invocations
of the function with identical arguments. 
Such a function can be safely used in expressions, because
if the compiler optimizes away one or more calls to the
function, operation of the program is unaffected (aside
from being speeded up).

<br>

<h2>Warning Messages and Error Messages</h2>

<p>The GNU compiler can produce two kinds of diagnostics: errors and
warnings. 
Each kind has a different purpose:

<ul>
<li><em>Errors</em> report problems that make it impossible to compile your
program. 
GNU Fortran reports errors with the source file name, line
number, and column within the line where the problem is apparent.

<li><em>Warnings</em> report other unusual conditions in your code that
<em>might</em> indicate a problem, although compilation can (and does)
proceed. 
Warning messages also report the source file name, line number,
and column information,
but include the text <code>warning:</code> to distinguish them
from error messages. 
</ul>

<p>Warnings might indicate danger points where you should check to make sure
that your program really does what you intend; or the use of obsolete
features; or the use of nonstandard features of GNU Fortran. 
Many warnings are issued only if you ask for them, with one of the
<code>-W</code> options (for instance, <code>-Wall</code> requests a variety of
useful warnings).

<p><em>Note:</em> Currently, the text of the line and a pointer to the column
is printed in most <code>g77</code> diagnostics. 
Probably, as of version 0.6, <code>g77</code> will
no longer print the text of the source line, instead printing
the column number following the file name and line number in
a form that GNU Emacs recognizes. 
This change is expected to speed up and reduce the memory usage
of the <code>g77</code> compiler.

<p>See <a href="#Warning%20Options">Options to Request or Suppress Warnings</a>, for
more detail on these and related command-line options.

<h1>Reporting Bugs</h1>

<p>Your bug reports play an essential role in making GNU Fortran reliable.

<p>When you encounter a problem, the first thing to do is to see if it is
already known. 
See <a href="#Trouble">Trouble</a>. 
If it isn't known, then you should report the problem.

<p>Reporting a bug might help you by bringing a solution to your problem, or
it might not. 
(If it does not, look in the service directory; see
<a href="#Service">Service</a>.) 
In any case, the principal function of a bug report is
to help the entire community by making the next version of GNU Fortran work
better. 
Bug reports are your contribution to the maintenance of GNU Fortran.

<p>Since the maintainers are very overloaded, we cannot respond to every
bug report. 
However, if the bug has not been fixed, we are likely to
send you a patch and ask you to tell us whether it works.

<p>In order for a bug report to serve its purpose, you must include the
information that makes for fixing the bug.

<h2>Have You Found a Bug?</h2>

<p>If you are not sure whether you have found a bug, here are some guidelines:

<ul>
<li>If the compiler gets a fatal signal, for any input whatever, that is a
compiler bug. 
Reliable compilers never crash--they just remain obsolete.

<li>If the compiler produces invalid assembly code, for any input whatever,
that is a compiler bug, unless the
compiler reports errors (not just warnings) which would ordinarily
prevent the assembler from being run.

<li>If the compiler produces valid assembly code that does not correctly
execute the input source code, that is a compiler bug.

<p>However, you must double-check to make sure, because you might have run
into an incompatibility between GNU Fortran and traditional Fortran. 
These incompatibilities might be considered
bugs, but they are inescapable consequences of valuable features.

<p>Or you might have a program whose behavior is undefined, which happened
by chance to give the desired results with another Fortran compiler. 
It is best to check the relevant Fortran standard thoroughly if
it is possible that the program indeed does something undefined.

<p>After you have localized the error to a single source line, it should
be easy to check for these things. 
If your program is correct and well defined, you have found
a compiler bug.

<p>It might help if, in your submission, you identified the specific
language in the relevant Fortran standard that specifies the
desired behavior, if it isn't likely to be obvious and agreed-upon
by all Fortran users.

</p><li>If the compiler produces an error message for valid input, that is a
compiler bug.

<li>If the compiler does not produce an error message for invalid input,
that is a compiler bug. 
However, you should note that your idea of
"invalid input" might be someone else's idea
of "an extension" or "support for traditional practice".

<li>If you are an experienced user of Fortran compilers, your suggestions
for improvement of GNU Fortran are welcome in any case. 
</ul>

<p>Many, perhaps most, bug reports against <code>g77</code> turn out to
be bugs in the user's code. 
While we find such bug reports educational, they sometimes take
a considerable amount of time to track down or at least respond
to--time we could be spending making <code>g77</code>, not some user's
code, better.

<p>Some steps you can take to verify that the bug is not certainly
in the code you're compiling with <code>g77</code>:

<ul>
<li>Compile your code using the <code>g77</code> options <code>-W -Wall -O</code>. 
These options enable many useful warning; the <code>-O</code> option
enables flow analysis that enables the uninitialized-variable
warning.

<p>If you investigate the warnings and find evidence of possible bugs
in your code, fix them first and retry <code>g77</code>.

</p><li>Compile your code using the <code>g77</code> options <code>-finit-local-zero</code>,
<code>-fno-automatic</code>, <code>-ffloat-store</code>, and various
combinations thereof.

<p>If your code works with any of these combinations, that is not
proof that the bug isn't in <code>g77</code>--a <code>g77</code> bug exposed
by your code might simply be avoided, or have a different, more subtle
effect, when different options are used--but it can be a
strong indicator that your code is making unwarranted assumptions
about the Fortran dialect and/or underlying machine it is
being compiled and run on.

<p>See <a href="#Overly%20Convenient%20Options">Overly Convenient Command-Line Options</a>,
for information on the <code>-fno-automatic</code> and
<code>-finit-local-zero</code> options and how to convert
their use into selective changes in your own code.

</p><li>Validate your code with <code>ftnchek</code> or a similar code-checking
tool. 
<code>ftnchek</code> can be found at <a href="ftp://ftp.netlib.org/fortran">ftp://ftp.netlib.org/fortran</a>
or <a href="ftp://ftp.dsm.fordham.edu">ftp://ftp.dsm.fordham.edu</a>.

<p>Here are some sample <code>Makefile</code> rules using <code>ftnchek</code>
"project" files to do cross-file checking and <code>sfmakedepend</code>
(from <a href="ftp://ahab.rutgers.edu/pub/perl/sfmakedepend">ftp://ahab.rutgers.edu/pub/perl/sfmakedepend</a>)
to maintain dependencies automatically. 
These assume the use of GNU <code>make</code>.

</pre>

</p><li>Try your code out using other Fortran compilers, such as <code>f2c</code>. 
If it does not work on at least one other compiler (assuming the
compiler supports the features the code needs), that is a strong
indicator of a bug in the code.

<p>However, even if your code works on many compilers <em>except</em>
<code>g77</code>, that does <em>not</em> mean the bug is in <code>g77</code>. 
It might mean the bug is in your code, and that <code>g77</code> simply
exposes it more readily than other compilers.

<h2>Where to Report Bugs</h2>

<p>Send bug reports for GNU Fortran to <a href="mailto:gcc-bugs@gcc.gnu.org or bug-gcc@gnu.org">gcc-bugs@gcc.gnu.org or bug-gcc@gnu.org</a>.

<p>Often people think of posting bug reports to a newsgroup instead of
mailing them. 
This sometimes appears to work, but it has one problem which can be
crucial: a newsgroup posting does not contain a mail path back to the
sender. 
Thus, if maintainers need more information, they might be unable
to reach you.  For this reason, you should always send bug reports by
mail to the proper mailing list.

<p>As a last resort, send bug reports on paper to:

<h2>How to Report Bugs</h2>

<p>The fundamental principle of reporting bugs usefully is this:
<strong>report all the facts</strong>. 
If you are not sure whether to state a
fact or leave it out, state it!

<p>Often people omit facts because they think they know what causes the
problem and they conclude that some details don't matter. 
Thus, you might
assume that the name of the variable you use in an example does not matter. 
Well, probably it doesn't, but one cannot be sure. 
Perhaps the bug is a
stray memory reference which happens to fetch from the location where that
name is stored in memory; perhaps, if the name were different, the contents
of that location would fool the compiler into doing the right thing despite
the bug. 
Play it safe and give a specific, complete example. 
That is the
easiest thing for you to do, and the most helpful.

<p>Keep in mind that the purpose of a bug report is to enable someone to
fix the bug if it is not known. 
It isn't very important what happens if
the bug is already known. 
Therefore, always write your bug reports on
the assumption that the bug is not known.

<p>Sometimes people give a few sketchy facts and ask, "Does this ring a
bell?" 
This cannot help us fix a bug, so it is rarely helpful. 
We respond by asking for enough details to enable us to investigate. 
You might as well expedite matters by sending them to begin with. 
(Besides, there are enough bells ringing around here as it is.)

<p>Try to make your bug report self-contained. 
If we have to ask you for
more information, it is best if you include all the previous information
in your response, as well as the information that was missing.

<p>Please report each bug in a separate message. 
This makes it easier for
us to track which bugs have been fixed and to forward your bugs reports
to the appropriate maintainer.

<p>Do not compress and encode any part of your bug report using programs
such as <code>uuencode</code>. 
If you do so it will slow down the processing
of your bug. 
If you must submit multiple large files, use <code>shar</code>,
which allows us to read your message without having to run any
decompression programs.

<p>(As a special exception for GNU Fortran bug-reporting, at least
for now, if you are sending more than a few lines of code, if
your program's source file format contains "interesting" things
like trailing spaces or strange characters, or if you need to
include binary data files, it is acceptable to put all the
files together in a <code>tar</code> archive, and, whether you need to
do that, it is acceptable to then compress the single file (<code>tar</code>
archive or source file)
using <code>gzip</code> and encode it via <code>uuencode</code>. 
Do not use any MIME stuff--the current maintainer can't decode this. 
Using <code>compress</code> instead of <code>gzip</code> is acceptable, assuming
you have licensed the use of the patented algorithm in
<code>compress</code> from Unisys.)

<p>To enable someone to investigate the bug, you should include all these
things:

<ul>
<li>The version of GNU Fortran. 
You can get this by running <code>g77</code> with the <code>-v</code> option. 
(Ignore any error messages that might be displayed
when the linker is run.)

<p>Without this, we won't know whether there is any point in looking for
the bug in the current version of GNU Fortran.

</p><li>A complete input file that will reproduce the bug.

<p>If your source file(s) require preprocessing
(for example, their names have suffixes like
<code>.F</code>, <code>.fpp</code>, <code>.FPP</code>, and <code>.r</code>),
and the bug is in the compiler proper (<code>f771</code>)
or in a subsequent phase of processing,
run your source file through the C preprocessor
by doing <code>g77 -E <var>sourcefile</var> &gt; <var>newfile</var></code>. 
Then, include the contents of <var>newfile</var> in the bug report. 
(When you do this, use the same preprocessor options--such as
<code>-I</code>, <code>-D</code>, and <code>-U</code>--that you used in actual
compilation.)

<p>A single statement is not enough of an example. 
In order to compile it,
it must be embedded in a complete file of compiler input. 
The bug might depend on the details of how this is done.

<p>Without a real example one can compile,
all anyone can do about your bug report is wish you luck. 
It would be futile to try to guess how to provoke the bug. 
For example, bugs in register allocation and reloading
can depend on every little detail of the source and include files
that trigger them.

</p><li>Note that you should include with your bug report any files
included by the source file
(via the <code>#include</code> or <code>INCLUDE</code> directive)
that you send, and any files they include, and so on.

<p>It is not necessary to replace
the <code>#include</code> and <code>INCLUDE</code> directives
with the actual files in the version of the source file that
you send, but it might make submitting the bug report easier
in the end. 
However, be sure to <em>reproduce</em> the bug using the <em>exact</em>
version of the source material you submit, to avoid wild-goose
chases.

</p><li>The command arguments you gave GNU Fortran to compile that example
and observe the bug.  For example, did you use <code>-O</code>?  To guarantee
you won't omit something important, list all the options.

<p>If we were to try to guess the arguments, we would probably guess wrong
and then we would not encounter the bug.

</p><li>The type of machine you are using, and the operating system name and
version number. 
(Much of this information is printed by <code>g77 -v</code>--if you
include that, send along any additional info you have that you
don't see clearly represented in that output.)

<li>The operands you gave to the <code>configure</code> command when you installed
the compiler.

<li>A complete list of any modifications you have made to the compiler
source.  (We don't promise to investigate the bug unless it happens in
an unmodified compiler.  But if you've made modifications and don't tell
us, then you are sending us on a wild-goose chase.)

<p>Be precise about these changes.  A description in English is not
enough--send a context diff for them.

<p>Adding files of your own (such as a machine description for a machine we
don't support) is a modification of the compiler source.

</p><li>Details of any other deviations from the standard procedure for installing
GNU Fortran.

<li>A description of what behavior you observe that you believe is
incorrect.  For example, "The compiler gets a fatal signal," or,
"The assembler instruction at line 208 in the output is incorrect."

<p>Of course, if the bug is that the compiler gets a fatal signal, then one
can't miss it.  But if the bug is incorrect output, the maintainer might
not notice unless it is glaringly wrong.  None of us has time to study
all the assembler code from a 50-line Fortran program just on the chance that
one instruction might be wrong.  We need <em>you</em> to do this part!

<p>Even if the problem you experience is a fatal signal, you should still
say so explicitly.  Suppose something strange is going on, such as, your
copy of the compiler is out of synch, or you have encountered a bug in
the C library on your system.  (This has happened!)  Your copy might
crash and the copy here would not.  If you <i>said</i> to expect a crash,
then when the compiler here fails to crash, we would know that the bug
was not happening.  If you don't say to expect a crash, then we would
not know whether the bug was happening.  We would not be able to draw
any conclusion from our observations.

<p>If the problem is a diagnostic when building GNU Fortran with some other
compiler, say whether it is a warning or an error.

<p>Often the observed symptom is incorrect output when your program is run. 
Sad to say, this is not enough information unless the program is short
and simple.  None of us has time to study a large program to figure out
how it would work if compiled correctly, much less which line of it was
compiled wrong.  So you will have to do that.  Tell us which source line
it is, and what incorrect result happens when that line is executed.  A
person who understands the program can find this as easily as finding a
bug in the program itself.

</p><li>If you send examples of assembler code output from GNU Fortran,
please use <code>-g</code> when you make them.  The debugging information
includes source line numbers which are essential for correlating the
output with the input.

<li>If you wish to mention something in the GNU Fortran source, refer to it by
context, not by line number.

<p>The line numbers in the development sources don't match those in your
sources.  Your line numbers would convey no convenient information to the
maintainers.

</p><li>Additional information from a debugger might enable someone to find a
problem on a machine which he does not have available.  However, you
need to think when you collect this information if you want it to have
any chance of being useful.

<p>For example, many people send just a backtrace, but that is never
useful by itself.  A simple backtrace with arguments conveys little
about GNU Fortran because the compiler is largely data-driven; the same
functions are called over and over for different RTL insns, doing
different things depending on the details of the insn.

<p>Most of the arguments listed in the backtrace are useless because they
are pointers to RTL list structure.  The numeric values of the
pointers, which the debugger prints in the backtrace, have no
significance whatever; all that matters is the contents of the objects
they point to (and most of the contents are other such pointers).

<p>In addition, most compiler passes consist of one or more loops that
scan the RTL insn sequence.  The most vital piece of information about
such a loop--which insn it has reached--is usually in a local variable,
not in an argument.

<p>What you need to provide in addition to a backtrace are the values of
the local variables for several stack frames up.  When a local
variable or an argument is an RTX, first print its value and then use
the GDB command <code>pr</code> to print the RTL expression that it points
to.  (If GDB doesn't run on your machine, use your debugger to call
the function <code>debug_rtx</code> with the RTX as an argument.)  In
general, whenever a variable is a pointer, its value is no use
without the data it points to. 
</ul>

<p>Here are some things that are not necessary:

<ul>
<li>A description of the envelope of the bug.

<p>Often people who encounter a bug spend a lot of time investigating
which changes to the input file will make the bug go away and which
changes will not affect it.

<p>This is often time consuming and not very useful, because the way we
will find the bug is by running a single example under the debugger with
breakpoints, not by pure deduction from a series of examples.  You might
as well save your time for something else.

<p>Of course, if you can find a simpler example to report <em>instead</em> of
the original one, that is a convenience.  Errors in the output will be
easier to spot, running under the debugger will take less time, etc. 
Most GNU Fortran bugs involve just one function, so the most straightforward
way to simplify an example is to delete all the function definitions
except the one where the bug occurs.  Those earlier in the file may be
replaced by external declarations if the crucial function depends on
them.  (Exception: inline functions might affect compilation of functions
defined later in the file.)

<p>However, simplification is not vital; if you don't want to do this,
report the bug anyway and send the entire test case you used.

</p><li>In particular, some people insert conditionals <code>#ifdef BUG</code> around
a statement which, if removed, makes the bug not happen.  These are just
clutter; we won't pay any attention to them anyway.  Besides, you should
send us preprocessor output, and that can't have conditionals.

<li>A patch for the bug.

<p>A patch for the bug is useful if it is a good one.  But don't omit the
necessary information, such as the test case, on the assumption that a
patch is all we need.  We might see problems with your patch and decide
to fix the problem another way, or we might not understand it at all.

<p>Sometimes with a program as complicated as GNU Fortran it is very hard to
construct an example that will make the program follow a certain path
through the code.  If you don't send the example, we won't be able to
construct one, so we won't be able to verify that the bug is fixed.

<p>And if we can't understand what bug you are trying to fix, or why your
patch should be an improvement, we won't install it.  A test case will
help us to understand.

<p>See <a href="#Sending%20Patches">Sending Patches</a>, for guidelines on how to make it easy for us to
understand and install your patches.

</p><li>A guess about what the bug is or what it depends on.

<p>Such guesses are usually wrong.  Even the maintainer can't guess right
about such things without first using the debugger to find the facts.

</p><li>A core dump file.

<p>We have no way of examining a core dump for your type of machine
unless we have an identical system--and if we do have one,
we should be able to reproduce the crash ourselves.

<h2>Sending Patches for GNU Fortran</h2>

<p>If you would like to write bug fixes or improvements for the GNU Fortran
compiler, that is very helpful. 
Send suggested fixes to the bug report
mailing list, <a href="mailto:gcc-bugs@gcc.gnu.org or bug-gcc@gnu.org">gcc-bugs@gcc.gnu.org or bug-gcc@gnu.org</a>.

<p>Please follow these guidelines so we can study your patches efficiently. 
If you don't follow these guidelines, your information might still be
useful, but using it will take extra work.  Maintaining GNU Fortran is a lot
of work in the best of circumstances, and we can't keep up unless you do
your best to help.

<ul>
<li>Send an explanation with your changes of what problem they fix or what
improvement they bring about.  For a bug fix, just include a copy of the
bug report, and explain why the change fixes the bug.

<p>(Referring to a bug report is not as good as including it, because then
we will have to look it up, and we have probably already deleted it if
we've already fixed the bug.)

</p><li>Always include a proper bug report for the problem you think you have
fixed.  We need to convince ourselves that the change is right before
installing it.  Even if it is right, we might have trouble judging it if
we don't have a way to reproduce the problem.

<li>Include all the comments that are appropriate to help people reading the
source in the future understand why this change was needed.

<li>Don't mix together changes made for different reasons. 
Send them <em>individually</em>.

<p>If you make two changes for separate reasons, then we might not want to
install them both.  We might want to install just one.  If you send them
all jumbled together in a single set of diffs, we have to do extra work
to disentangle them--to figure out which parts of the change serve
which purpose.  If we don't have time for this, we might have to ignore
your changes entirely.

<p>If you send each change as soon as you have written it, with its own
explanation, then the two changes never get tangled up, and we can
consider each one properly without any extra work to disentangle them.

<p>Ideally, each change you send should be impossible to subdivide into
parts that we might want to consider separately, because each of its
parts gets its motivation from the other parts.

</p><li>Send each change as soon as that change is finished.  Sometimes people
think they are helping us by accumulating many changes to send them all
together.  As explained above, this is absolutely the worst thing you
could do.

<p>Since you should send each change separately, you might as well send it
right away.  That gives us the option of installing it immediately if it
is important.

</p><li>Use <code>diff -c</code> to make your diffs.  Diffs without context are hard
for us to install reliably.  More than that, they make it hard for us to
study the diffs to decide whether we want to install them.  Unidiff
format is better than contextless diffs, but not as easy to read as
<code>-c</code> format.

<p>If you have GNU <code>diff</code>, use <code>diff -cp</code>, which shows the name of the
function that each change occurs in. 
(The maintainer of GNU Fortran currently uses <code>diff -rcp2N</code>.)

</p><li>Write the change log entries for your changes.  We get lots of changes,
and we don't have time to do all the change log writing ourselves.

<p>Read the <code>ChangeLog</code> file to see what sorts of information to put
in, and to learn the style that we use.  The purpose of the change log
is to show people where to find what was changed.  So you need to be
specific about what functions you changed; in large functions, it's
often helpful to indicate where within the function the change was.

<p>On the other hand, once you have shown people where to find the change,
you need not explain its purpose.  Thus, if you add a new function, all
you need to say about it is that it is new.  If you feel that the
purpose needs explaining, it probably does--but the explanation will be
much more useful if you put it in comments in the code.

<p>If you would like your name to appear in the header line for who made
the change, send us the header line.

</p><li>When you write the fix, keep in mind that we can't install a change that
would break other systems.

<p>People often suggest fixing a problem by changing machine-independent
files such as <code>toplev.c</code> to do something special that a particular
system needs.  Sometimes it is totally obvious that such changes would
break GNU Fortran for almost all users.  We can't possibly make a change like
that.  At best it might tell us how to write another patch that would
solve the problem acceptably.

<p>Sometimes people send fixes that <em>might</em> be an improvement in
general--but it is hard to be sure of this.  It's hard to install
such changes because we have to study them very carefully.  Of course,
a good explanation of the reasoning by which you concluded the change
was correct can help convince us.

<p>The safest changes are changes to the configuration files for a
particular machine.  These are safe because they can't create new bugs
on other machines.

<p>Please help us keep up with the workload by designing the patch in a
form that is good to install.

<h1>How To Get Help with GNU Fortran</h1>

<p>If you need help installing, using or changing GNU Fortran, there are two
ways to find it:

<ul>
<li>Look in the service directory for someone who might help you for a fee. 
The service directory is found in the file named <code>SERVICE</code> in the
GNU CC distribution.

<li>Send a message to <a href="mailto:gcc@gcc.gnu.org">gcc@gcc.gnu.org</a>. 
</ul>

<p><hr>
Node:<a name="Adding%20Options">Adding Options</a>,
Next:<a rel=next href="#Projects">Projects</a>,
Previous:<a rel=previous href="#Service">Service</a>,
Up:<a rel=up href="#Top">Top</a>
<br>

<h1>Adding Options</h1>

<p>To add a new command-line option to <code>g77</code>, first decide
what kind of option you wish to add. 
Search the <code>g77</code> and <code>gcc</code> documentation for one
or more options that is most closely like the one you want to add
(in terms of what kind of effect it has, and so on) to
help clarify its nature.

<ul>
<li><em>Fortran options</em> are options that apply only
when compiling Fortran programs. 
They are accepted by <code>g77</code> and <code>gcc</code>, but
they apply only when compiling Fortran programs.

<li><em>Compiler options</em> are options that apply
when compiling most any kind of program. 
</ul>

<p><em>Fortran options</em> are listed in the file
<code>egcs/gcc/f/lang-options.h</code>,
which is used during the build of <code>gcc</code> to
build a list of all options that are accepted by
at least one language's compiler. 
This list goes into the <code>lang_options</code> array
in <code>gcc/toplev.c</code>, which uses this array to
determine whether a particular option should be
offered to the linked-in front end for processing
by calling <code>lang_option_decode</code>, which, for
<code>g77</code>, is in <code>egcs/gcc/f/com.c</code> and just
calls <code>ffe_decode_option</code>.

<p>If the linked-in front end "rejects" a
particular option passed to it, <code>toplev.c</code>
just ignores the option, because <em>some</em>
language's compiler is willing to accept it.

<p>This allows commands like <code>gcc -fno-asm foo.c bar.f</code>
to work, even though Fortran compilation does
not currently support the <code>-fno-asm</code> option;
even though the <code>f771</code> version of <code>lang_decode_option</code>
rejects <code>-fno-asm</code>, <code>toplev.c</code> doesn't
produce a diagnostic because some other language (C)
does accept it.

<p>This also means that commands like
<code>g77 -fno-asm foo.f</code> yield no diagnostics,
despite the fact that no phase of the command was
able to recognize and process <code>-fno-asm</code>--perhaps
a warning about this would be helpful if it were
possible.

<p>Code that processes Fortran options is found in
<code>egcs/gcc/f/top.c</code>, function <code>ffe_decode_option</code>. 
This code needs to check positive and negative forms
of each option.

<p>The defaults for Fortran options are set in their
global definitions, also found in <code>egcs/gcc/f/top.c</code>. 
Many of these defaults are actually macros defined
in <code>egcs/gcc/f/target.h</code>, since they might be
machine-specific. 
However, since, in practice, GNU compilers
should behave the same way on all configurations
(especially when it comes to language constructs),
the practice of setting defaults in <code>target.h</code>
is likely to be deprecated and, ultimately, stopped
in future versions of <code>g77</code>.

<p>Accessor macros for Fortran options, used by code
in the <code>g77</code> FFE, are defined in <code>egcs/gcc/f/top.h</code>.

<p><em>Compiler options</em> are listed in <code>gcc/toplev.c</code>
in the array <code>f_options</code>. 
An option not listed in <code>lang_options</code> is
looked up in <code>f_options</code> and handled from there.

<p>The defaults for compiler options are set in the
global definitions for the corresponding variables,
some of which are in <code>gcc/toplev.c</code>.

<p>You can set different defaults for <em>Fortran-oriented</em>
or <em>Fortran-reticent</em> compiler options by changing
the source code of <code>g77</code> and rebuilding. 
How to do this depends on the version of <code>g77</code>:

<dl>
<dt><code>G77 0.5.24 (EGCS 1.1)</code>
<dt><code>G77 0.5.25 (EGCS 1.2)</code>
<dd>Change the <code>lang_init_options</code> routine in <code>egcs/gcc/f/com.c</code>.

<p>(Note that these versions of <code>g77</code>
perform internal consistency checking automatically
when the <code>-fversion</code> option is specified.)

<br><dt><code>G77 0.5.23</code>
<dt><code>G77 0.5.24 (EGCS 1.0)</code>
<dd>Change the way <code>f771</code> handles the <code>-fset-g77-defaults</code>
option, which is always provided as the first option when
called by <code>g77</code> or <code>gcc</code>.

<p>This code is in <code>ffe_decode_options</code> in <code>egcs/gcc/f/top.c</code>. 
Have it change just the variables that you want to default
to a different setting for Fortran compiles compared to
compiles of other languages.

<p>The <code>-fset-g77-defaults</code> option is passed to <code>f771</code>
automatically because of the specification information
kept in <code>egcs/gcc/f/lang-specs.h</code>. 
This file tells the <code>gcc</code> command how to recognize,
in this case, Fortran source files (those to be preprocessed,
and those that are not), and further, how to invoke the
appropriate programs (including <code>f771</code>) to process
those source files.

<p>It is in <code>egcs/gcc/f/lang-specs.h</code> that <code>-fset-g77-defaults</code>,
<code>-fversion</code>, and other options are passed, as appropriate,
even when the user has not explicitly specified them. 
Other "internal" options such as <code>-quiet</code> also
are passed via this mechanism.

<h2>Improve Efficiency</h2>

<p>Don't bother doing any performance analysis until most of the
following items are taken care of, because there's no question
they represent serious space/time problems, although some of
them show up only given certain kinds of (popular) input.

<ul>
<li>Improve <code>malloc</code> package and its uses to specify more info about
memory pools and, where feasible, use obstacks to implement them.

<li>Skip over uninitialized portions of aggregate areas (arrays,
<code>COMMON</code> areas, <code>EQUIVALENCE</code> areas) so zeros need not be output. 
This would reduce memory usage for large initialized aggregate
areas, even ones with only one initialized element.

<p>As of version 0.5.18, a portion of this item has already been
accomplished.

</p><li>Prescan the statement (in <code>sta.c</code>) so that the nature of the statement
is determined as much as possible by looking entirely at its form,
and not looking at any context (previous statements, including types
of symbols). 
This would allow ripping out of the statement-confirmation,
symbol retraction/confirmation, and diagnostic inhibition
mechanisms. 
Plus, it would result in much-improved diagnostics. 
For example, <code>CALL some-intrinsic(<small>...</small>)</code>, where the intrinsic
is not a subroutine intrinsic, would result actual error instead of the
unimplemented-statement catch-all.

<li>Throughout <code>g77</code>, don't pass line/column pairs where
a simple <code>ffewhere</code> type, which points to the error as much as is
desired by the configuration, will do, and don't pass <code>ffelexToken</code> types
where a simple <code>ffewhere</code> type will do. 
Then, allow new default
configuration of <code>ffewhere</code> such that the source line text is not
preserved, and leave it to things like Emacs' next-error function
to point to them (now that <code>next-error</code> supports column,
or, perhaps, character-offset, numbers). 
The change in calling sequences should improve performance somewhat,
as should not having to save source lines. 
(Whether this whole
item will improve performance is questionable, but it should
improve maintainability.)

<li>Handle <code>DATA (A(I),I=1,1000000)/1000000*2/</code> more efficiently, especially
as regards the assembly output. 
Some of this might require improving
the back end, but lots of improvement in space/time required in <code>g77</code>
itself can be fairly easily obtained without touching the back end. 
Maybe type-conversion, where necessary, can be speeded up as well in
cases like the one shown (converting the <code>2</code> into <code>2.</code>).

<li>If analysis shows it to be worthwhile, optimize <code>lex.c</code>.

<li>Consider redesigning <code>lex.c</code> to not need any feedback
during tokenization, by keeping track of enough parse state on its
own. 
</ul>

<h2>Better Optimization</h2>

<p>Much of this work should be put off until after <code>g77</code> has
all the features necessary for its widespread acceptance as a
useful F77 compiler. 
However, perhaps this work can be done in parallel during
the feature-adding work.

<ul>
<li>Do the equivalent of the trick of putting <code>extern inline</code> in front
of every function definition in <code>libg2c</code> and #include'ing the resulting
file in <code>f2c</code>+<code>gcc</code>--that is, inline all run-time-library functions
that are at all worth inlining. 
(Some of this has already been done, such as for integral exponentiation.)

<li>When doing <code>CHAR_VAR = CHAR_FUNC(<small>...</small>)</code>,
and it's clear that types line up
and <code>CHAR_VAR</code> is addressable or not a <code>VAR_DECL</code>,
make <code>CHAR_VAR</code>, not a
temporary, be the receiver for <code>CHAR_FUNC</code>. 
(This is now done for <code>COMPLEX</code> variables.)

<li>Design and implement Fortran-specific optimizations that don't
really belong in the back end, or where the front end needs to
give the back end more info than it currently does.

<li>Design and implement a new run-time library interface, with the
code going into <code>libgcc</code> so no special linking is required to
link Fortran programs using standard language features. 
This library
would speed up lots of things, from I/O (using precompiled formats,
doing just one, or, at most, very few, calls for arrays or array sections,
and so on) to general computing (array/section implementations of
various intrinsics, implementation of commonly performed loops that
aren't likely to be optimally compiled otherwise, etc.).

<p>Among the important things the library would do are:

<ul>
<li>Be a one-stop-shop-type
library, hence shareable and usable by all, in that what are now
library-build-time options in <code>libg2c</code> would be moved at least to the
<code>g77</code> compile phase, if not to finer grains (such as choosing how
list-directed I/O formatting is done by default at <code>OPEN</code> time, for
preconnected units via options or even statements in the main program
unit, maybe even on a per-I/O basis with appropriate pragma-like
devices). 
</ul>

<li>Probably requiring the new library design, change interface to
normally have <code>COMPLEX</code> functions return their values in the way
<code>gcc</code> would if they were declared <code>__complex__ float</code>,
rather than using
the mechanism currently used by <code>CHARACTER</code> functions (whereby the
functions are compiled as returning void and their first arg is
a pointer to where to store the result). 
(Don't append underscores to
external names for <code>COMPLEX</code> functions in some cases once <code>g77</code> uses
<code>gcc</code> rather than <code>f2c</code> calling conventions.)

<li>Do something useful with <code>doiter</code> references where possible. 
For example, <code>CALL FOO(I)</code> cannot modify <code>I</code> if within
a <code>DO</code> loop that uses <code>I</code> as the
iteration variable, and the back end might find that info useful
in determining whether it needs to read <code>I</code> back into a register after
the call. 
(It normally has to do that, unless it knows <code>FOO</code> never
modifies its passed-by-reference argument, which is rarely the case
for Fortran-77 code.) 
</ul>

<h2>Simplify Porting</h2>

<p>Making <code>g77</code> easier to configure, port, build, and install, either
as a single-system compiler or as a cross-compiler, would be
very useful.

<ul>
<li>A new library (replacing <code>libg2c</code>) should improve portability as well as
produce more optimal code. 
Further, <code>g77</code> and the new library should
conspire to simplify naming of externals, such as by removing unnecessarily
added underscores, and to reduce/eliminate the possibility of naming
conflicts, while making debugger more straightforward.

<p>Also, it should
make multi-language applications more feasible, such as by providing
Fortran intrinsics that get Fortran unit numbers given C <code>FILE *</code>
descriptors.

</p><li>Possibly related to a new library, <code>g77</code> should produce the equivalent
of a <code>gcc</code> <code>main(argc, argv)</code> function when it compiles a
main program unit, instead of compiling something that must be
called by a library
implementation of <code>main()</code>.

<p>This would do many useful things such as
provide more flexibility in terms of setting up exception handling,
not requiring programmers to start their debugging sessions with
<kbd>breakpoint MAIN__</kbd> followed by <kbd>run</kbd>, and so on.

</p><li>The GBE needs to understand the difference between alignment
requirements and desires. 
For example, on Intel x86 machines, <code>g77</code> currently imposes
overly strict alignment requirements, due to the back end, but it
would be useful for Fortran and C programmers to be able to override
these <em>recommendations</em> as long as they don't violate the actual
processor <em>requirements</em>. 
</ul>

<h2>More Extensions</h2>

<p>These extensions are not the sort of things users ask for "by name",
but they might improve the usability of <code>g77</code>, and Fortran in
general, in the long run. 
Some of these items really pertain to improving <code>g77</code> internals
so that some popular extensions can be more easily supported.

<ul>
<li>Look through all the documentation on the GNU Fortran language,
dialects, compiler, missing features, bugs, and so on. 
Many mentions of incomplete or missing features are
sprinkled throughout. 
It is not worth repeating them here.

<li>Consider adding a <code>NUMERIC</code> type to designate typeless numeric constants,
named and unnamed. 
The idea is to provide a forward-looking, effective
replacement for things like the old-style <code>PARAMETER</code> statement
when people
really need typelessness in a maintainable, portable, clearly documented
way. 
Maybe <code>TYPELESS</code> would include <code>CHARACTER</code>, <code>POINTER</code>,
and whatever else might come along. 
(This is not really a call for polymorphism per se, just
an ability to express limited, syntactic polymorphism.)

<li>Support <code>OPEN(<small>...</small>,KEY=(<small>...</small>),<small>...</small>)</code>.

<li>Support arbitrary file unit numbers, instead of limiting them
to 0 through <code>MXUNIT-1</code>. 
(This is a <code>libg2c</code> issue.)

<li><code>OPEN(NOSPANBLOCKS,<small>...</small>)</code> is treated as
<code>OPEN(UNIT=NOSPANBLOCKS,<small>...</small>)</code>, so a
later <code>UNIT=</code> in the first example is invalid. 
Make sure this is what users of this feature would expect.

<li>Currently <code>g77</code> disallows <code>READ(1'10)</code> since
it is an obnoxious syntax, but
supporting it might be pretty easy if needed. 
More details are needed, such
as whether general expressions separated by an apostrophe are supported,
or maybe the record number can be a general expression, and so on.

<li>Support <code>STRUCTURE</code>, <code>UNION</code>, <code>MAP</code>, and <code>RECORD</code>
fully. 
Currently there is no support at all
for <code>%FILL</code> in <code>STRUCTURE</code> and related syntax,
whereas the rest of the
stuff has at least some parsing support. 
This requires either major
changes to <code>libg2c</code> or its replacement.

<li>F90 and <code>g77</code> probably disagree about label scoping relative to
<code>INTERFACE</code> and <code>END INTERFACE</code>, and their contained
procedure interface bodies (blocks?).

<li><code>ENTRY</code> doesn't support F90 <code>RESULT()</code> yet,
since that was added after S8.112.

<li>Empty-statement handling (10 ;;CONTINUE;;) probably isn't consistent
with the final form of the standard (it was vague at S8.112).

<li>It seems to be an "open" question whether a file, immediately after being
<code>OPEN</code>ed,is positioned at the beginning, the end, or wherever--it
might be nice to offer an option of opening to "undefined" status, requiring
an explicit absolute-positioning operation to be performed before any
other (besides <code>CLOSE</code>) to assist in making applications port to systems
(some IBM?) that <code>OPEN</code> to the end of a file or some such thing. 
</ul>

<br>

<h2>Machine Model</h2>

<p>This items pertain to generalizing <code>g77</code>'s view of
the machine model to more fully accept whatever the GBE
provides it via its configuration.

<ul>
<li>Switch to using <code>REAL_VALUE_TYPE</code> to represent floating-point constants
exclusively so the target float format need not be required. 
This
means changing the way <code>g77</code> handles initialization of aggregate areas
having more than one type, such as <code>REAL</code> and <code>INTEGER</code>,
because currently
it initializes them as if they were arrays of <code>char</code> and uses the
bit patterns of the constants of the various types in them to determine
what to stuff in elements of the arrays.

<li>Rely more and more on back-end info and capabilities, especially in the
area of constants (where having the <code>g77</code> front-end's IL just store
the appropriate tree nodes containing constants might be best).

<li>Suite of C and Fortran programs that a user/administrator can run on a
machine to help determine the configuration for <code>g77</code> before building
and help determine if the compiler works (especially with whatever
libraries are installed) after building. 
</ul>

<h2>Internals Documentation</h2>

<p>Better info on how <code>g77</code> works and how to port it is needed. 
Much of this should be done only after the redesign planned for
0.6 is complete.

on <code>g77</code> internals.

<br>

<h2>Internals Improvements</h2>

<p>Some more items that would make <code>g77</code> more reliable
and easier to maintain:

<ul>
<li>Generally make expression handling focus
more on critical syntax stuff, leaving semantics to callers. 
For example,
anything a caller can check, semantically, let it do so, rather
than having <code>expr.c</code> do it. 
(Exceptions might include things like
diagnosing <code>FOO(I--K:)=BAR</code> where <code>FOO</code> is a <code>PARAMETER</code>--if
it seems
important to preserve the left-to-right-in-source order of production
of diagnostics.)

<li>Come up with better naming conventions for <code>-D</code> to establish requirements
to achieve desired implementation dialect via <code>proj.h</code>.

<li>Clean up used tokens and <code>ffewhere</code>s in <code>ffeglobal_terminate_1</code>.

<li>Replace <code>sta.c</code> <code>outpooldisp</code> mechanism with <code>malloc_pool_use</code>.

<li>Check for <code>opANY</code> in more places in <code>com.c</code>, <code>std.c</code>,
and <code>ste.c</code>, and get rid of the <code>opCONVERT(opANY)</code> kludge
(after determining if there is indeed no real need for it).

<li>Utility to read and check <code>bad.def</code> messages and their references in the
code, to make sure calls are consistent with message templates.

<li>Search and fix <code>&amp;ffe<small>...</small></code> and similar so that
<code>ffe<small>...</small>ptr<small>...</small></code> macros are
available instead (a good argument for wishing this could have written all
this stuff in C++, perhaps). 
On the other hand, it's questionable whether this sort of
improvement is really necessary, given the availability of
tools such as Emacs and Perl, which make finding any
address-taking of structure members easy enough?

<li>Some modules truly export the member names of their structures (and the
structures themselves), maybe fix this, and fix other modules that just
appear to as well (by appending <code>_</code>, though it'd be ugly and probably
not worth the time).

<li>Implement C macros <code>RETURNS(value)</code> and <code>SETS(something,value)</code>
in <code>proj.h</code>
and use them throughout <code>g77</code> source code (especially in the definitions
of access macros in <code>.h</code> files) so they can be tailored
to catch code writing into a <code>RETURNS()</code> or reading from a <code>SETS()</code>.

<li>Decorate throughout with <code>const</code> and other such stuff.

<li>All F90 notational derivations in the source code are still based
on the S8.112 version of the draft standard. 
Probably should update
to the official standard, or put documentation of the rules as used
in the code<small>...</small>uh<small>...</small>in the code.

<li>Some <code>ffebld_new</code> calls (those outside of <code>ffeexpr.c</code> or
inside but invoked via paths not involving <code>ffeexpr_lhs</code> or
<code>ffeexpr_rhs</code>) might be creating things
in improper pools, leading to such things staying around too long or
(doubtful, but possible and dangerous) not long enough.

<li>Some <code>ffebld_list_new</code> (or whatever) calls might not be matched by
<code>ffebld_list_bottom</code> (or whatever) calls, which might someday matter. 
(It definitely is not a problem just yet.)

<li>Probably not doing clean things when we fail to <code>EQUIVALENCE</code> something
due to alignment/mismatch or other problems--they end up without
<code>ffestorag</code> objects, so maybe the backend (and other parts of the front
end) can notice that and handle like an <code>opANY</code> (do what it wants, just
don't complain or crash). 
Most of this seems to have been addressed
by now, but a code review wouldn't hurt.

<h2>Better Diagnostics</h2>

<p>These are things users might not ask about, or that need to
be looked into, before worrying about. 
Also here are items that involve reducing unnecessary diagnostic
clutter.

<ul>
<li>When <code>FUNCTION</code> and <code>ENTRY</code> point types disagree (<code>CHARACTER</code>
lengths, type classes, and so on),
<code>ANY</code>-ize the offending <code>ENTRY</code> point and any <em>new</em> dummies
it specifies.

<li>Speed up and improve error handling for data when repeat-count is
specified. 
For example, don't output 20 unnecessary messages after the
first necessary one for:

<pre>INTEGER X(20)
CONTINUE
DATA (X(I), J= 1, 20) /20*5/
END
</pre>

<p>(The <code>CONTINUE</code> statement ensures the <code>DATA</code> statement
is processed in the context of executable, not specification,
statements.)

<h1>Front End</h1>

<h2>Overview of Sources</h2>

<p>The current directory layout includes the following:

<dl>
<dt><code>{No value for `srcdir'}/gcc/</code>
<dd>Non-g77 files in gcc

<br><dt><code>{No value for `srcdir'}/gcc/f/</code>
<dd>GNU Fortran front end sources

<br><dt><code>{No value for `srcdir'}/libf2c/</code>
<dd><code>libg2c</code> configuration and <code>g2c.h</code> file generation

<br><dt><code>{No value for `srcdir'}/libf2c/libF77/</code>
<dd>General support and math portion of <code>libg2c</code>

<br><dt><code>{No value for `srcdir'}/libf2c/libI77/</code>
<dd>I/O portion of <code>libg2c</code>

<br><dt><code>{No value for `srcdir'}/libf2c/libU77/</code>
<dd>Additional interfaces to Unix <code>libc</code> for <code>libg2c</code>
</dl>

<p>Components of note in <code>g77</code> are described below.

<p><code>f/</code> as a whole contains the source for <code>g77</code>,
while <code>libf2c/</code> contains a portion of the separate program
<code>f2c</code>. 
Note that the <code>libf2c</code> code is not part of the program <code>g77</code>,
just distributed with it.

<p><code>f/</code> contains text files that document the Fortran compiler, source
files for the GNU Fortran Front End (FFE), and some other stuff. 
The <code>g77</code> compiler code is placed in <code>f/</code> because it,
along with its contents,
is designed to be a subdirectory of a <code>gcc</code> source directory,
<code>gcc/</code>,
which is structured so that language-specific front ends can be "dropped
in" as subdirectories. 
The C++ front end (<code>g++</code>), is an example of this--it resides in
the <code>cp/</code> subdirectory. 
Note that the C front end (also referred to as <code>gcc</code>)
is an exception to this, as its source files reside
in the <code>gcc/</code> directory itself.

<p><code>libf2c/</code> contains the run-time libraries for the <code>f2c</code> program,
also used by <code>g77</code>. 
These libraries normally referred to collectively as <code>libf2c</code>. 
When built as part of <code>g77</code>,
<code>libf2c</code> is installed under the name <code>libg2c</code> to avoid
conflict with any existing version of <code>libf2c</code>,
and thus is often referred to as <code>libg2c</code> when the
<code>g77</code> version is specifically being referred to.

<p>The <code>netlib</code> version of <code>libf2c/</code>
contains two distinct libraries,
<code>libF77</code> and <code>libI77</code>,
each in their own subdirectories. 
In <code>g77</code>, this distinction is not made,
beyond maintaining the subdirectory structure in the source-code tree.

<p><code>libf2c/</code> is not part of the program <code>g77</code>,
just distributed with it. 
It contains files not present
in the official (<code>netlib</code>) version of <code>libf2c</code>,
and also contains some minor changes made from <code>libf2c</code>,
to fix some bugs,
and to facilitate automatic configuration, building, and installation of
<code>libf2c</code> (as <code>libg2c</code>) for use by <code>g77</code> users. 
See <code>libf2c/README</code> for more information,
including licensing conditions
governing distribution of programs containing code from <code>libg2c</code>.

<p><code>libg2c</code>, <code>g77</code>'s version of <code>libf2c</code>,
adds Dave Love's implementation of <code>libU77</code>,
in the <code>libf2c/libU77/</code> directory. 
This library is distributed under the
GNU Library General Public License (LGPL)--see the
file <code>libf2c/libU77/COPYING.LIB</code>
for more information,
as this license
governs distribution conditions for programs containing code
from this portion of the library.

<p>Files of note in <code>f/</code> and <code>libf2c/</code> are described below:

<dl>
<dt><code>f/BUGS</code>
<dd>Lists some important bugs known to be in g77. 
Or use Info (or GNU Emacs Info mode) to read
the "Actual Bugs" node of the <code>g77</code> documentation:

<pre>info -f f/g77.info -n "Actual Bugs"
</pre>

<br><dt><code>f/ChangeLog</code>
<dd>Lists recent changes to <code>g77</code> internals.

<br><dt><code>libf2c/ChangeLog</code>
<dd>Lists recent changes to <code>libg2c</code> internals.

<br><dt><code>f/NEWS</code>
<dd>Contains the per-release changes. 
These include the user-visible
changes described in the node "Changes"
in the <code>g77</code> documentation, plus internal
changes of import. 
Or use:

<pre>info -f f/g77.info -n News
</pre>

<br><dt><code>f/g77.info*</code>
<dd>The <code>g77</code> documentation, in Info format,
produced by building <code>g77</code>.

<p>All users of <code>g77</code> (not just installers) should read this,
using the <code>more</code> command if neither the <code>info</code> command,
nor GNU Emacs (with its Info mode), are available, or if users
aren't yet accustomed to using these tools. 
All of these files are readable as "plain text" files,
though they're easier to navigate using Info readers
such as <code>info</code> and GNU Emacs Info mode. 
</dl>

<p>If you want to explore the FFE code, which lives entirely in <code>f/</code>,
here are a few clues. 
The file <code>g77spec.c</code> contains the <code>g77</code>-specific source code
for the <code>g77</code> command only--this just forms a variant of the
<code>gcc</code> command, so,
just as the <code>gcc</code> command itself does not contain the C front end,
the <code>g77</code> command does not contain the Fortran front end (FFE). 
The FFE code ends up in an executable named <code>f771</code>,
which does the actual compiling,
so it contains the FFE plus the <code>gcc</code> back end (GBE),
the latter to do most of the optimization, and the code generation.

<p>The file <code>parse.c</code> is the source file for <code>yyparse()</code>,
which is invoked by the GBE to start the compilation process,
for <code>f771</code>.

<p>The file <code>top.c</code> contains the top-level FFE function <code>ffe_file</code>
and it (along with top.h) define all <code>ffe_[a-z].*</code>, <code>ffe[A-Z].*</code>,
and <code>FFE_[A-Za-z].*</code> symbols.

<p>The file <code>fini.c</code> is a <code>main()</code> program that is used when building
the FFE to generate C header and source files for recognizing keywords. 
The files <code>malloc.c</code> and <code>malloc.h</code> comprise a memory manager
that defines all <code>malloc_[a-z].*</code>, <code>malloc[A-Z].*</code>, and
<code>MALLOC_[A-Za-z].*</code> symbols.

<p>All other modules named <var>xyz</var>
are comprised of all files named <code><var>xyz</var>*.<var>ext</var></code>
and define all <code>ffe<var>xyz</var>_[a-z].*</code>, <code>ffe<var>xyz</var>[A-Z].*</code>,
and <code>FFE<var>XYZ</var>_[A-Za-z].*</code> symbols. 
If you understand all this, congratulations--it's easier for me to remember
how it works than to type in these regular expressions. 
But it does make it easy to find where a symbol is defined. 
For example, the symbol <code>ffexyz_set_something</code> would be defined
in <code>xyz.h</code> and implemented there (if it's a macro) or in <code>xyz.c</code>.

<p>The "porting" files of note currently are:

<dl>
<dt><code>proj.c</code>
<dt><code>proj.h</code>
<dd>This defines the "language" used by all the other source files,
the language being Standard C plus some useful things
like <code>ARRAY_SIZE</code> and such.

<br><dt><code>target.c</code>
<dt><code>target.h</code>
<dd>These describe the target machine
in terms of what data types are supported,
how they are denoted
(to what C type does an <code>INTEGER*8</code> map, for example),
how to convert between them,
and so on. 
Over time, versions of <code>g77</code> rely less on this file
and more on run-time configuration based on GBE info
in <code>com.c</code>.

<br><dt><code>com.c</code>
<dt><code>com.h</code>
<dd>These are the primary interface to the GBE.

<br><dt><code>ste.c</code>
<dt><code>ste.h</code>
<dd>This contains code for implementing recognized executable statements
in the GBE.

<br><dt><code>src.c</code>
<dt><code>src.h</code>
<dd>These contain information on the format(s) of source files
(such as whether they are never to be processed as case-insensitive
with regard to Fortran keywords). 
</dl>

<p>If you want to debug the <code>f771</code> executable,
for example if it crashes,
note that the global variables <code>lineno</code> and <code>input_filename</code>
are usually set to reflect the current line being read by the lexer
during the first-pass analysis of a program unit and to reflect
the current line being processed during the second-pass compilation
of a program unit.

<p>If an invocation of the function <code>ffestd_exec_end</code> is on the stack,
the compiler is in the second pass, otherwise it is in the first.

<p>(This information might help you reduce a test case and/or work around
a bug in <code>g77</code> until a fix is available.)

<h2>Overview of Translation Process</h2>

<p>The order of phases translating source code to the form accepted
by the GBE is:

<ol type=1 start=1>
</p><li>Stripping punched-card sources (<code>g77stripcard.c</code>)

<li>Lexing (<code>lex.c</code>)

<li>Stand-alone statement identification (<code>sta.c</code>)

<li>Parsing (<code>stb.c</code> and <code>expr.c</code>)

<li>Constructing (<code>stc.c</code>)

<li>Collecting (<code>std.c</code>)

<li>Expanding (<code>ste.c</code>)
</ol>

<p>To get a rough idea of how a particularly twisted Fortran statement
gets treated by the passes, consider:

<pre>      FORMAT(I2 4H)=(J/
     &amp;   I3)
</pre>

<p>The job of <code>lex.c</code> is to know enough about Fortran syntax rules
to break the statement up into distinct lexemes without requiring
any feedback from subsequent phases:

<pre>`FORMAT'
`('
`I24H'
`)'
`='
`('
`J'
`/'
`I3'
`)'
</pre>

<p>The job of <code>sta.c</code> is to figure out the kind of statement,
or, at least, statement form, that sequence of lexemes represent.

<p>The sooner it can do this (in terms of using the smallest number of
lexemes, starting with the first for each statement), the better,
because that leaves diagnostics for problems beyond the recognition
of the statement form to subsequent phases,
which can usually better describe the nature of the problem.

<p>In this case, the <code>=</code> at "level zero"
(not nested within parentheses)
tells <code>sta.c</code> that this is an <em>assignment-form</em>,
not <code>FORMAT</code>, statement.

<p>An assignment-form statement might be a statement-function
definition or an executable assignment statement.

<p>To make that determination,
<code>sta.c</code> looks at the first two lexemes.

<p>Since the second lexeme is <code>(</code>,
the first must represent an array for this to be an assignment statement,
else it's a statement function.

<p>Either way, <code>sta.c</code> hands off the statement to <code>stb.c</code>
(either its statement-function parser or its assignment-statement parser).

<p><code>stb.c</code> forms a
statement-specific record containing the pertinent information. 
That information includes a source expression and,
for an assignment statement, a destination expression. 
Expressions are parsed by <code>expr.c</code>.

<p>This record is passed to <code>stc.c</code>,
which copes with the implications of the statement
within the context established by previous statements.

<p>For example, if it's the first statement in the file
or after an <code>END</code> statement,
<code>stc.c</code> recognizes that, first of all,
a main program unit is now being lexed
(and tells that to <code>std.c</code>
before telling it about the current statement).

<p><code>stc.c</code> attaches whatever information it can,
usually derived from the context established by the preceding statements,
and passes the information to <code>std.c</code>.

<p><code>std.c</code> saves this information away,
since the GBE cannot cope with information
that might be incomplete at this stage.

<p>For example, <code>I3</code> might later be determined
to be an argument to an alternate <code>ENTRY</code> point.

<p>When <code>std.c</code> is told about the end of an external (top-level)
program unit,
it passes all the information it has saved away
on statements in that program unit
to <code>ste.c</code>.

<p><code>ste.c</code> "expands" each statement, in sequence, by
constructing the appropriate GBE information and calling
the appropriate GBE routines.

<p>Details on the transformational phases follow. 
Keep in mind that Fortran numbering is used,
so the first character on a line is column 1,
decimal numbering is used, and so on.

<h3>g77stripcard</h3>

<p>The <code>g77stripcard</code> program handles removing content beyond
column 72 (adjustable via a command-line option),
optionally warning about that content being something other
than trailing whitespace or Fortran commentary.

<p>This program is needed because <code>lex.c</code> doesn't pay attention
to maximum line lengths at all, to make it easier to maintain,
as well as faster (for sources that don't depend on the maximum
column length vis-a-vis trailing non-blank non-commentary content).

<p>Just how this program will be run--whether automatically for
old source (perhaps as the default for <code>.f</code> files?)--is not
yet determined.

<p>In the meantime, it might as well be implemented as a typical UNIX pipe.

<p>It should accept a <code>-fline-length-<var>n</var></code> option,
with the default line length set to 72.

<p>When the text it strips off the end of a line is not blank
(not spaces and tabs),
it should insert an additional comment line
(beginning with <code>!</code>,
so it works for both fixed-form and free-form files)
containing the text,
following the stripped line. 
The inserted comment should have a prefix of some kind,
TBD, that distinguishes the comment as representing stripped text. 
Users could use that to <code>sed</code> out such lines, if they wished--it
seems silly to provide a command-line option to delete information
when it can be so easily filtered out by another program.

<p>(This inserted comment should be designed to "fit in" well
with whatever the Fortran community is using these days for
preprocessor, translator, and other such products, like OpenMP. 
What that's all about, and how <code>g77</code> can elegantly fit its
special comment conventions into it all, is TBD as well. 
We don't want to reinvent the wheel here, but if there turn out
to be too many conflicting conventions, we might have to invent
one that looks nothing like the others, but which offers their
host products a better infrastructure in which to fit and coexist
peacefully.)

<p><code>g77stripcard</code> probably shouldn't do any tab expansion or other
fancy stuff. 
People can use <code>expand</code> or other pre-filtering if they like. 
The idea here is to keep each stage quite simple, while providing
excellent performance for "normal" code.

<p>(Code with junk beyond column 73 is not really "normal",
as it comes from a card-punch heritage,
and will be increasingly hard for tomorrow's Fortran programmers to read.)

<h3>lex.c</h3>

<p>To help make the lexer simple, fast, and easy to maintain,
while also having <code>g77</code> generally encourage Fortran programmers
to write simple, maintainable, portable code by maximizing the
performance of compiling that kind of code:

<ul>
<li>There'll be just one lexer, for both fixed-form and free-form source.

<li>It'll care about the form only when handling the first 7 columns of
text, stuff like spaces between strings of alphanumerics, and
how lines are continued.

<p>Some other distinctions will be handled by subsequent phases,
so at least one of them will have to know which form is involved.

<p>For example, <code>I = 2 . 4</code> is acceptable in fixed form,
and works in free form as well given the implementation <code>g77</code>
presently uses. 
But the standard requires a diagnostic for it in free form,
so the parser has to be able to recognize that
the lexemes aren't contiguous
(information the lexer <em>does</em> have to provide)
and that free-form source is being parsed,
so it can provide the diagnostic.

<p>The <code>g77</code> lexer doesn't try to gather <code>2 . 4</code> into a single lexeme. 
Otherwise, it'd have to know a whole lot more about how to parse Fortran,
or subsequent phases (mainly parsing) would have two paths through
lots of critical code--one to handle the lexeme <code>2</code>, <code>.</code>,
and <code>4</code> in sequence, another to handle the lexeme <code>2.4</code>.

</p><li>It won't worry about line lengths
(beyond the first 7 columns for fixed-form source).

<p>That is, once it starts parsing the "statement" part of a line
(column 7 for fixed-form, column 1 for free-form),
it'll keep going until it finds a newline,
rather than ignoring everything past a particular column
(72 or 132).

<p>The implication here is that there shouldn't <em>be</em>
anything past that last column, other than whitespace or
commentary, because users using typical editors
(or viewing output as typically printed)
won't necessarily know just where the last column is.

<p>Code that has "garbage" beyond the last column
(almost certainly only fixed-form code with a punched-card legacy,
such as code using columns 73-80 for "sequence numbers")
will have to be run through <code>g77stripcard</code> first.

<p>Also, keeping track of the maximum column position while also watching out
for the end of a line <em>and</em> while reading from a file
just makes things slower. 
Since a file must be read, and watching for the end of the line
is necessary (unless the typical input file was preprocessed to
include the necessary number of trailing spaces),
dropping the tracking of the maximum column position
is the only way to reduce the complexity of the pertinent code
while maintaining high performance.

</p><li>ASCII encoding is assumed for the input file.

<p>Code written in other character sets will have to be converted first.

</p><li>Tabs (ASCII code 9)
will be converted to spaces via the straightforward
approach.

<p>Specifically, a tab is converted to between one and eight spaces
as necessary to reach column <var>n</var>,
where dividing <code>(<var>n</var> - 1)</code> by eight
results in a remainder of zero.

</p><li>Linefeeds (ASCII code 10)
mark the ends of lines.

<li>A carriage return (ASCII code 13)
is accept if it immediately precedes a linefeed,
in which case it is ignored.

<p>Otherwise, it is rejected (with a diagnostic).

</p><li>Any other characters other than the above
that are not part of the GNU Fortran Character Set
(see <a href="#Character%20Set">Character Set</a>)
are rejected with a diagnostic.

<p>This includes backspaces, form feeds, and the like.

<p>(It might make sense to allow a form feed in column 1
as long as that's the only character on a line. 
It certainly wouldn't seem to cost much in terms of performance.)

</p><li>The end of the input stream (EOF)
ends the current line.

<li>The distinction between uppercase and lowercase letters
will be preserved.

<p>It will be up to subsequent phases to decide to fold case.

<p>Current plans are to permit any casing for Fortran (reserved) keywords
while preserving casing for user-defined names. 
(This might not be made the default for <code>.f</code> files, though.)

<p>Preserving case seems necessary to provide more direct access
to facilities outside of <code>g77</code>, such as to C or Pascal code.

<p>Names of intrinsics will probably be matchable in any case,
However, there probably won't be any option to require
a particular mixed-case appearance of intrinsics
(as there was for <code>g77</code> prior to version 0.6),
because that's painful to maintain,
and probably nobody uses it.

<p>(How <code>external SiN; r = sin(x)</code> would be handled is TBD. 
I think old <code>g77</code> might already handle that pretty elegantly,
but whether we can cope with allowing the same fragment to reference
a <em>different</em> procedure, even with the same interface,
via <code>s = SiN(r)</code>, needs to be determined. 
If it can't, we need to make sure that when code introduces
a user-defined name, any intrinsic matching that name
using a case-insensitive comparison
is "turned off".)

</p><li>Backslashes in <code>CHARACTER</code> and Hollerith constants
are not allowed.

<p>This avoids the confusion introduced by some Fortran compiler vendors
providing C-like interpretation of backslashes,
while others provide straight-through interpretation.

<p>Some kind of lexical construct (TBD) will be provided to allow
flagging of a <code>CHARACTER</code>
(but probably not a Hollerith)
constant that permits backslashes. 
It'll necessarily be a prefix, such as:

<pre>PRINT *, C'This line has a backspace \b here.'
PRINT *, F'This line has a straight backslash \ here.'
</pre>

<p>Further, command-line options might be provided to specify that
one prefix or the other is to be assumed as the default
for <code>CHARACTER</code> constants.

<p>However, it seems more helpful for <code>g77</code> to provide a program
that converts prefix all constants
(or just those containing backslashes)
with the desired designation,
so printouts of code can be read
without knowing the compile-time options used when compiling it.

<p>If such a program is provided
(let's name it <code>g77slash</code> for now),
then a command-line option to <code>g77</code> should not be provided. 
(Though, given that it'll be easy to implement, it might be hard
to resist user requests for it "to compile faster than if we
have to invoke another filter".)

<p>This program would take a command-line option to specify the
default interpretation of slashes,
affecting which prefix it uses for constants.

<p><code>g77slash</code> probably should automatically convert Hollerith
constants that contain slashes
to the appropriate <code>CHARACTER</code> constants. 
Then <code>g77</code> wouldn't have to define a prefix syntax for Hollerith
constants specifying whether they want C-style or straight-through
backslashes. 
</ul>

<p>The above implements nearly exactly what is specified by
<a href="#Character%20Set">Character Set</a>,
and
<a href="#Lines">Lines</a>,
except it also provides automatic conversion of tabs
and ignoring of newline-related carriage returns.

<p>It also effects the "pure visual" model,
by which is meant that a user viewing his code
in a typical text editor
(assuming it's not preprocessed via <code>g77stripcard</code> or similar)
doesn't need any special knowledge
of whether spaces on the screen are really tabs,
whether lines end immediately after the last visible non-space character
or after a number of spaces and tabs that follow it,
or whether the last line in the file is ended by a newline.

<p>Most editors don't make these distinctions,
the ANSI FORTRAN 77 standard doesn't require them to,
and it permits a standard-conforming compiler
to define a method for transforming source code to
"standard form" however it wants.

<p>So, GNU Fortran defines it such that users have the best chance
of having the code be interpreted the way it looks on the screen
of the typical editor.

<p>(Fancy editors should <em>never</em> be required to correctly read code
written in classic two-dimensional-plaintext form. 
By correct reading I mean ability to read it, book-like, without
mistaking text ignored by the compiler for program code and vice versa,
and without having to count beyond the first several columns. 
The vague meaning of ASCII TAB, among other things, complicates
this somewhat, but as long as "everyone", including the editor,
other tools, and printer, agrees about the every-eighth-column convention,
the GNU Fortran "pure visual" model meets these requirements. 
Any language or user-visible source form
requiring special tagging of tabs,
the ends of lines after spaces/tabs,
and so on, is broken by this definition. 
Fortunately, Fortran <em>itself</em> is not broken,
even if most vendor-supplied defaults for their Fortran compilers <em>are</em>
in this regard.)

<p>Further, this model provides a clean interface
to whatever preprocessors or code-generators are used
to produce input to this phase of <code>g77</code>. 
Mainly, they need not worry about long lines.

<h3>Gotchas (Transforming)</h3>

<p>This section is not about transforming "gotchas" into something else. 
It is about the weirder aspects of transforming Fortran,
however that's defined,
into a more modern, canonical form.

<h4>Multi-character Lexemes</h4>

<p>Each lexeme carries with it a pointer to where it appears in the source.

<p>To provide the ability for diagnostics to point to column numbers,
in addition to line numbers and names,
lexemes that represent more than one (significant) character
in the source code need, generally,
to provide pointers to where each <em>character</em> appears in the source.

<p>This provides the ability to properly identify the precise location
of the problem in code like

<pre>SUBROUTINE X
END
BLOCK DATA X
END
</pre>

<p>which, in fixed-form source, would result in single lexemes
consisting of the strings <code>SUBROUTINEX</code> and <code>BLOCKDATAX</code>. 
(The problem is that <code>X</code> is defined twice,
so a pointer to the <code>X</code> in the second definition,
as well as a follow-up pointer to the corresponding pointer in the first,
would be preferable to pointing to the beginnings of the statements.)

<p>This need also arises when parsing (and diagnosing) <code>FORMAT</code>
statements.

<p>Further, it arises when diagnosing
<code>FMT=</code> specifiers that contain constants
(or partial constants, or even propagated constants!) 
in I/O statements, as in:

<pre>PRINT '(I2, 3HAB)', J
</pre>

<p>(A pointer to the beginning of the prematurely-terminated Hollerith
constant, and/or to the close parenthese, is preferable to a pointer
to the open-parenthese or the apostrophe that precedes it.)

<p>Multi-character lexemes, which would seem to naturally include
at least digit strings, alphanumeric strings, <code>CHARACTER</code>
constants, and Hollerith constants, therefore need to provide
location information on each character. 
(Maybe Hollerith constants don't, but it's unnecessary to except them.)

<p>The question then arises, what about <em>other</em> multi-character lexemes,
such as <code>**</code> and <code>//</code>,
and Fortran 90's <code>(/</code>, <code>/)</code>, <code>::</code>, and so on?

<p>Turns out there's a need to identify the location of the second character
of these two-character lexemes. 
For example, in <code>I(/J) = K</code>, the slash needs to be diagnosed
as the problem, not the open parenthese. 
Similarly, it is preferable to diagnose the second slash in
<code>I = J // K</code> rather than the first, given the implicit typing
rules, which would result in the compiler disallowing the attempted
concatenation of two integers. 
(Though, since that's more of a semantic issue,
it's not <em>that</em> much preferable.)

<p>Even sequences that could be parsed as digit strings could use location info,
for example, to diagnose the <code>9</code> in the octal constant <code>O'129'</code>. 
(This probably will be parsed as a character string,
to be consistent with the parsing of <code>Z'129A'</code>.)

<p>To avoid the hassle of recording the location of the second character,
while also preserving the general rule that each significant character
is distinctly pointed to by the lexeme that contains it,
it's best to simply not have any fixed-size lexemes
larger than one character.

<p>This new design is expected to make checking for two
<code>*</code> lexemes in a row much easier than the old design,
so this is not much of a sacrifice. 
It probably makes the lexer much easier to implement
than it makes the parser harder.

<h4>Space-padding Lexemes</h4>

<p>Certain lexemes need to be padded with virtual spaces when the
end of the line (or file) is encountered.

<p>This is necessary in fixed form, to handle lines that don't
extend to column 72, assuming that's the line length in effect.

<h4>Bizarre Free-form Hollerith Constants</h4>

<p>Last I checked, the Fortran 90 standard actually required the compiler
to silently accept something like

<pre>FORMAT ( 1 2   Htwelve chars )
</pre>

<p>as a valid <code>FORMAT</code> statement specifying a twelve-character
Hollerith constant.

<p>The implication here is that, since the new lexer is a zero-feedback one,
it won't know that the special case of a <code>FORMAT</code> statement being parsed
requires apparently distinct lexemes <code>1</code> and <code>2</code> to be treated as
a single lexeme.

<p>(This is a horrible misfeature of the Fortran 90 language. 
It's one of many such misfeatures that almost make me want
to not support them, and forge ahead with designing a new
"GNU Fortran" language that has the features,
but not the misfeatures, of Fortran 90,
and provide utility programs to do the conversion automatically.)

<p>So, the lexer must gather distinct chunks of decimal strings into
a single lexeme in contexts where a single decimal lexeme might
start a Hollerith constant.

<p>(Which probably means it might as well do that all the time
for all multi-character lexemes, even in free-form mode,
leaving it to subsequent phases to pull them apart as they see fit.)

<p>Compare the treatment of this to how

<pre>CHARACTER * 4 5 HEY
</pre>

<p>and

<pre>CHARACTER * 12 HEY
</pre>

<p>must be treated--the former must be diagnosed, due to the separation
between lexemes, the latter must be accepted as a proper declaration.

<h4>Hollerith Constants</h4>

<p>Recognizing a Hollerith constant--specifically,
that an <code>H</code> or <code>h</code> after a digit string begins
such a constant--requires some knowledge of context.

<p>Hollerith constants (such as <code>2HAB</code>) can appear after:

<ul>
<li><code>(</code>

<li><code>,</code>

<li><code>=</code>

<li><code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>/</code>

<li><code>*</code>, except as noted below
</ul>

<p>Hollerith constants don't appear after:

<ul>
<li><code>CHARACTER*</code>,
which can be treated generally as
any <code>*</code> that is the second lexeme of a statement
</ul>

<h4>Confusing Function Keyword</h4>

<p>While

<pre>REAL FUNCTION FOO ()
</pre>

<p>must be a <code>FUNCTION</code> statement and

<pre>REAL FUNCTION FOO (5)
</pre>

<p>must be a type-definition statement,

<pre>REAL FUNCTION FOO (<var>names</var>)
</pre>

<p>where <var>names</var> is a comma-separated list of names,
can be one or the other.

<p>The only way to disambiguate that statement
(short of mandating free-form source or a short maximum
length for name for external procedures)
is based on the context of the statement.

<p>In particular, the statement is known to be within an
already-started program unit
(but not at the outer level of the <code>CONTAINS</code> block),
it is a type-declaration statement.

<p>Otherwise, the statement is a <code>FUNCTION</code> statement,
in that it begins a function program unit
(external, or, within <code>CONTAINS</code>, nested).

<h4>Weird READ</h4>

<p>The statement

<pre>READ (N)
</pre>

<p>is equivalent to either

<pre>READ (UNIT=(N))
</pre>

<p>or

<pre>READ (FMT=(N))
</pre>

<p>depending on which would be valid in context.

<p>Specifically, if <code>N</code> is type <code>INTEGER</code>,
<code>READ (FMT=(N))</code> would not be valid,
because parentheses may not be used around <code>N</code>,
whereas they may around it in <code>READ (UNIT=(N))</code>.

<p>Further, if <code>N</code> is type <code>CHARACTER</code>,
the opposite is true--<code>READ (UNIT=(N))</code> is not valid,
but <code>READ (FMT=(N))</code> is.

<p>Strictly speaking, if anything follows

<pre>READ (N)
</pre>

<p>in the statement, whether the first lexeme after the close
parenthese is a comma could be used to disambiguate the two cases,
without looking at the type of <code>N</code>,
because the comma is required for the <code>READ (FMT=(N))</code>
interpretation and disallowed for the <code>READ (UNIT=(N))</code>
interpretation.

<p>However, in practice, many Fortran compilers allow
the comma for the <code>READ (UNIT=(N))</code>
interpretation anyway
(in that they generally allow a leading comma before
an I/O list in an I/O statement),
and much code takes advantage of this allowance.

<p>(This is quite a reasonable allowance, since the
juxtaposition of a comma-separated list immediately
after an I/O control-specification list, which is also comma-separated,
without an intervening comma,
looks sufficiently "wrong" to programmers
that they can't resist the itch to insert the comma. 
<code>READ (I, J), K, L</code> simply looks cleaner than
<code>READ (I, J) K, L</code>.)

<p>So, type-based disambiguation is needed unless strict adherence
to the standard is always assumed, and we're not going to assume that.

<h3>TBD (Transforming)</h3>

<p>Continue researching gotchas, designing the transformational process,
and implementing it.

<p>Specific issues to resolve:

<ul>
<li>Just where should <code>INCLUDE</code> processing take place?

<p>Clearly before (or part of) statement identification (<code>sta.c</code>),
since determining whether <code>I(J)=K</code> is a statement-function
definition or an assignment statement requires knowing the context,
which in turn requires having processed <code>INCLUDE</code> files.

</p><li>Just where should (if it was implemented) <code>USE</code> processing take place?

<p>This gets into the whole issue of how <code>g77</code> should handle the concept
of modules. 
I think GNAT already takes on this issue, but don't know more than that. 
Jim Giles has written extensively on <code>comp.lang.fortran</code>
about his opinions on module handling, as have others. 
Jim's views should be taken into account.

<p>Actually, Richard M. Stallman (RMS) also has written up
some guidelines for implementing such things,
but I'm not sure where I read them. 
Perhaps the old <a href="mailto:gcc2@cygnus.com">gcc2@cygnus.com</a> list.

<p>If someone could dig references to these up and get them to me,
that would be much appreciated! 
Even though modules are not on the short-term list for implementation,
it'd be helpful to know <em>now</em> how to avoid making them harder to
implement them <em>later</em>.

</p><li>Should the <code>g77</code> command become just a script that invokes
all the various preprocessing that might be needed,
thus making it seem slower than necessary for legacy code
that people are unwilling to convert,
or should we provide a separate script for that,
thus encouraging people to convert their code once and for all?

<p>At least, a separate script to behave as old <code>g77</code> did,
perhaps named <code>g77old</code>, might ease the transition,
as might a corresponding one that converts source codes
named <code>g77oldnew</code>.

<p>These scripts would take all the pertinent options <code>g77</code> used
to take and run the appropriate filters,
passing the results to <code>g77</code> or just making new sources out of them
(in a subdirectory, leaving the user to do the dirty deed of
moving or copying them over the old sources).

</p><li>Do other Fortran compilers provide a prefix syntax
to govern the treatment of backslashes in <code>CHARACTER</code>
(or Hollerith) constants?

<p>Knowing what other compilers provide would help.

</p><li>Is it okay to drop support for the <code>-fintrin-case-initcap</code>,
<code>-fmatch-case-initcap</code>, <code>-fsymbol-case-initcap</code>,
and <code>-fcase-initcap</code> options?

<p>I've asked <a href="mailto:info-gnu-fortran@gnu.org">info-gnu-fortran@gnu.org</a> for input on this. 
Not having to support these makes it easier to write the new front end,
and might also avoid complicated its design.

<h2>Philosophy of Code Generation</h2>

<p>Don't poke the bear.

<p>The <code>g77</code> front end generates code
via the <code>gcc</code> back end.

<p>The <code>gcc</code> back end (GBE) is a large, complex
labyrinth of intricate code
written in a combination of the C language
and specialized languages internal to <code>gcc</code>.

<p>While the <em>code</em> that implements the GBE
is written in a combination of languages,
the GBE itself is,
to the front end for a language like Fortran,
best viewed as a <em>compiler</em>
that compiles its own, unique, language.

<p>The GBE's "source", then, is written in this language,
which consists primarily of
a combination of calls to GBE functions
and <dfn>tree</dfn> nodes
(which are, themselves, created
by calling GBE functions).

<p>So, the <code>g77</code> generates code by, in effect,
translating the Fortran code it reads
into a form "written" in the "language"
of the <code>gcc</code> back end.

<p>This language will heretofore be referred to as <dfn>GBEL</dfn>,
for GNU Back End Language.

<p>GBEL is an evolving language,
not fully specified in any published form
as of this writing. 
It offers many facilities,
but its "core" facilities
are those that corresponding most directly
to those needed to support <code>gcc</code>
(compiling code written in GNU C).

<p>The <code>g77</code> Fortran Front End (FFE)
is designed and implemented
to navigate the currents and eddies
of ongoing GBEL and <code>gcc</code> development
while also delivering on the potential
of an integrated FFE
(as compared to using a converter like <code>f2c</code>
and feeding the output into <code>gcc</code>).

<p>Goals of the FFE's code-generation strategy include:

<ul>
<li>High likelihood of generation of correct code,
or, failing that, producing a fatal diagnostic or crashing.

<li>Generation of highly optimized code,
as directed by the user
via GBE-specific (versus <code>g77</code>-specific) constructs,
such as command-line options.

<li>Fast overall (FFE plus GBE) compilation.

<li>Preservation of source-level debugging information. 
</ul>

<p>The strategies historically, and currently, used by the FFE
to achieve these goals include:

<ul>
<li>Use of GBEL constructs that most faithfully encapsulate
the semantics of Fortran.

<li>Avoidance of GBEL constructs that are so rarely used,
or limited to use in specialized situations not related to Fortran,
that their reliability and performance has not yet been established
as sufficient for use by the FFE.

<li>Flexible design, to readily accommodate changes to specific
code-generation strategies, perhaps governed by command-line options. 
</ul>

<p>"Don't poke the bear" somewhat summarizes the above strategies. 
The GBE is the bear. 
The FFE is designed and implemented to avoid poking it
in ways that are likely to just annoy it. 
The FFE usually either tackles it head-on,
or avoids treating it in ways dissimilar to how
the <code>gcc</code> front end treats it.

<p>For example, the FFE uses the native array facility in the back end
instead of the lower-level pointer-arithmetic facility
used by <code>gcc</code> when compiling <code>f2c</code> output). 
Theoretically, this presents more opportunities for optimization,
faster compile times,
and the production of more faithful debugging information. 
These benefits were not, however, immediately realized,
mainly because <code>gcc</code> itself makes little or no use
of the native array facility.

<p>Complex arithmetic is a case study of the evolution of this strategy. 
When originally implemented,
the GBEL had just evolved its own native complex-arithmetic facility,
so the FFE took advantage of that.

<p>When porting <code>g77</code> to 64-bit systems,
it was discovered that the GBE didn't really
implement its native complex-arithmetic facility properly.

<p>The short-term solution was to rewrite the FFE
to instead use the lower-level facilities
that'd be used by <code>gcc</code>-compiled code
(assuming that code, itself, didn't use the native complex type
provided, as an extension, by <code>gcc</code>),
since these were known to work,
and, in any case, if shown to not work,
would likely be rapidly fixed
(since they'd likely not work for vanilla C code in similar circumstances).

<p>However, the rewrite accommodated the original, native approach as well
by offering a command-line option to select it over the emulated approach. 
This allowed users, and especially GBE maintainers, to try out
fixes to complex-arithmetic support in the GBE
while <code>g77</code> continued to default to compiling more code correctly,
albeit producing (typically) slower executables.

<p>As of April 1999, it appeared that the last few bugs
in the GBE's support of its native complex-arithmetic facility
were worked out. 
The FFE was changed back to default to using that native facility,
leaving emulation as an option.

<p>Other Fortran constructs--arrays, character strings,
complex division, <code>COMMON</code> and <code>EQUIVALENCE</code> aggregates,
and so on--involve issues similar to those pertaining to complex arithmetic.

<p>So, it is possible that the history
of how the FFE handled complex arithmetic
will be repeated, probably in modified form
(and hopefully over shorter timeframes),
for some of these other facilities.

<h2>Two-pass Design</h2>

<p>The FFE does not tell the GBE anything about a program unit
until after the last statement in that unit has been parsed. 
(A program unit is a Fortran concept that corresponds, in the C world,
mostly closely to functions definitions in ISO C. 
That is, a program unit in Fortran is like a top-level function in C. 
Nested functions, found among the extensions offered by GNU C,
correspond roughly to Fortran's statement functions.)

<p>So, while parsing the code in a program unit,
the FFE saves up all the information
on statements, expressions, names, and so on,
until it has seen the last statement.

<p>At that point, the FFE revisits the saved information
(in what amounts to a second <dfn>pass</dfn> over the program unit)
to perform the actual translation of the program unit into GBEL,
ultimating in the generation of assembly code for it.

<p>Some lookahead is performed during this second pass,
so the FFE could be viewed as a "two-plus-pass" design.

<h3>Two-pass Code</h3>

<p>Most of the code that turns the first pass (parsing)
into a second pass for code generation
is in <code>egcs/gcc/f/std.c</code>.

<p>It has external functions,
called mainly by siblings in <code>egcs/gcc/f/stc.c</code>,
that record the information on statements and expressions
in the order they are seen in the source code. 
These functions save that information.

<p>It also has an external function that revisits that information,
calling the siblings in <code>egcs/gcc/f/ste.c</code>,
which handles the actual code generation
(by generating GBEL code,
that is, by calling GBE routines
to represent and specify expressions, statements, and so on).

<br>

<h3>Why Two Passes</h3>

<p>The need for two passes was not immediately evident
during the design and implementation of the code in the FFE
that was to produce GBEL. 
Only after a few kludges,
to handle things like incorrectly-guessed <code>ASSIGN</code> label nature,
had been implemented,
did enough evidence pile up to make it clear
that <code>std.c</code> had to be introduced to intercept,
save, then revisit as part of a second pass,
the digested contents of a program unit.

<p>Other such missteps have occurred during the evolution of the FFE,
because of the different goals of the FFE and the GBE.

<p>Because the GBE's original, and still primary, goal
was to directly support the GNU C language,
the GBEL, and the GBE itself,
requires more complexity
on the part of most front ends
than it requires of <code>gcc</code>'s.

<p>For example,
the GBEL offers an interface that permits the <code>gcc</code> front end
to implement most, or all, of the language features it supports,
without the front end having to
make use of non-user-defined variables. 
(It's almost certainly the case that all of K&amp;R C,
and probably ANSI C as well,
is handled by the <code>gcc</code> front end
without declaring such variables.)

<p>The FFE, on the other hand, must resort to a variety of "tricks"
to achieve its goals.

<p>Consider the following C code:

<pre>int
foo (int a, int b)
{
  int c = 0;

  if ((c = bar (c)) == 0)
    goto done;

  quux (c &lt;&lt; 1);

done:
  return c;
}
</pre>

<p>Note what kinds of objects are declared, or defined, before their use,
and before any actual code generation involving them
would normally take place:

<ul>
<li>Return type of function

<li>Entry point(s) of function

<li>Dummy arguments

<li>Variables

<li>Initial values for variables
</ul>

<p>Whereas, the following items can, and do,
suddenly appear "out of the blue" in C:

<ul>
<li>Label references

<li>Function references
</ul>

<p>Not surprisingly, the GBE faithfully permits the latter set of items
to be "discovered" partway through GBEL "programs",
just as they are permitted to in C.

<p>Yet, the GBE has tended, at least in the past,
to be reticent to fully support similar "late" discovery
of items in the former set.

<p>This makes Fortran a poor fit for the "safe" subset of GBEL. 
Consider:

<pre>      FUNCTION X (A, ARRAY, ID1)
      CHARACTER*(*) A
      DOUBLE PRECISION X, Y, Z, TMP, EE, PI
      REAL ARRAY(ID1*ID2)
      COMMON ID2
      EXTERNAL FRED

      ASSIGN 100 TO J
      CALL FOO (I)
      IF (I .EQ. 0) PRINT *, A(0)
      GOTO 200

      ENTRY Y (Z)
      ASSIGN 101 TO J
200   PRINT *, A(1)
      READ *, TMP
      GOTO J
100   X = TMP * EE
      RETURN
101   Y = TMP * PI
      CALL FRED
      DATA EE, PI /2.71D0, 3.14D0/
      END
</pre>

<p>Here are some observations about the above code,
which, while somewhat contrived,
conforms to the FORTRAN 77 and Fortran 90 standards:

<ul>
<li>The return type of function <code>X</code> is not known
until the <code>DOUBLE PRECISION</code> line has been parsed.

<li>Whether <code>A</code> is a function or a variable
is not known until the <code>PRINT *, A(0)</code> statement
has been parsed.

<li>The bounds of the array of argument <code>ARRAY</code>
depend on a computation involving
the subsequent argument <code>ID1</code>
and the blank-common member <code>ID2</code>.

<li>Whether <code>Y</code> and <code>Z</code> are local variables,
additional function entry points,
or dummy arguments to additional entry points
is not known
until the <code>ENTRY</code> statement is parsed.

<li>Similarly, whether <code>TMP</code> is a local variable is not known
until the <code>READ *, TMP</code> statement is parsed.

<li>The initial values for <code>EE</code> and <code>PI</code>
are not known until after the <code>DATA</code> statement is parsed.

<li>Whether <code>FRED</code> is a function returning type <code>REAL</code>
or a subroutine
(which can be thought of as returning type <code>void</code>
<em>or</em>, to support alternate returns in a simple way,
type <code>int</code>)
is not known
until the <code>CALL FRED</code> statement is parsed.

<li>Whether <code>100</code> is a <code>FORMAT</code> label
or the label of an executable statement
is not known
until the <code>X =</code> statement is parsed. 
(These two types of labels get <em>very</em> different treatment,
especially when <code>ASSIGN</code>'ed.)

<li>That <code>J</code> is a local variable is not known
until the first <code>ASSIGN</code> statement is parsed. 
(This happens <em>after</em> executable code has been seen.) 
</ul>

<p>Very few of these "discoveries"
can be accommodated by the GBE as it has evolved over the years. 
The GBEL doesn't support several of them,
and those it might appear to support
don't always work properly,
especially in combination with other GBEL and GBE features,
as implemented in the GBE.

<p>(Had the GBE and its GBEL originally evolved to support <code>g77</code>,
the shoe would be on the other foot, so to speak--most, if not all,
of the above would be directly supported by the GBEL,
and a few C constructs would probably not, as they are in reality,
be supported. 
Both this mythical, and today's real, GBE caters to its GBEL
by, sometimes, scrambling around, cleaning up after itself--after
discovering that assumptions it made earlier during code generation
are incorrect.)

<p>So, the FFE handles these discrepancies--between the order in which
it discovers facts about the code it is compiling,
and the order in which the GBEL and GBE support such discoveries--by
performing what amounts to two
passes over each program unit.

<p>(A few ambiguities can remain at that point,
such as whether, given <code>EXTERNAL BAZ</code>
and no other reference to <code>BAZ</code> in the program unit,
it is a subroutine, a function, or a block-data--which, in C-speak,
governs its declared return type. 
Fortunately, these distinctions are easily finessed
for the procedure, library, and object-file interfaces
supported by <code>g77</code>.)

<h2>Challenges Posed</h2>

<p>Consider the following Fortran code, which uses various extensions
(including some to Fortran 90):

<pre>SUBROUTINE X(A)
CHARACTER*(*) A
COMPLEX CFUNC
INTEGER*2 CLOCKS(200)
INTEGER IFUNC

CALL SYSTEM_CLOCK (CLOCKS (IFUNC (CFUNC ('('//A//')'))))
</pre>

<p>The above poses the following challenges to any Fortran compiler
that uses run-time interfaces, and a run-time library, roughly similar
to those used by <code>g77</code>:

<ul>
<li>Assuming the library routine that supports <code>SYSTEM_CLOCK</code>
expects to set an <code>INTEGER*4</code> variable via its <code>COUNT</code> argument,
the compiler must make available to it a temporary variable of that type.

<li>Further, after the <code>SYSTEM_CLOCK</code> library routine returns,
the compiler must ensure that the temporary variable it wrote
is copied into the appropriate element of the <code>CLOCKS</code> array. 
(This assumes the compiler doesn't just reject the code,
which it should if it is compiling under some kind of a "strict" option.)

<li>To determine the correct index into the <code>CLOCKS</code> array,
(putting aside the fact that the index, in this particular case,
need not be computed until after
the <code>SYSTEM_CLOCK</code> library routine returns),
the compiler must ensure that the <code>IFUNC</code> function is called.

<p>That requires evaluating its argument,
which requires, for <code>g77</code>
(assuming <code>-ff2c</code> is in force),
reserving a temporary variable of type <code>COMPLEX</code>
for use as a repository for the return value
being computed by <code>CFUNC</code>.

</p><li>Before invoking <code>CFUNC</code>,
is argument must be evaluated,
which requires allocating, at run time,
a temporary large enough to hold the result of the concatenation,
as well as actually performing the concatenation.

<li>The large temporary needed during invocation of <code>CFUNC</code>
should, ideally, be deallocated
(or, at least, left to the GBE to dispose of, as it sees fit)
as soon as <code>CFUNC</code> returns,
which means before <code>IFUNC</code> is called
(as it might need a lot of dynamically allocated memory). 
</ul>

<p><code>g77</code> currently doesn't support all of the above,
but, so that it might someday, it has evolved to handle
at least some of the above requirements.

<p>Meeting the above requirements is made more challenging
by conforming to the requirements of the GBEL/GBE combination.

<h2>Transforming Statements</h2>

<p>Most Fortran statements are given their own block,
and, for temporary variables they might need, their own scope. 
(A block is what distinguishes <code>{ foo (); }</code>
from just <code>foo ();</code> in C. 
A scope is included with every such block,
providing a distinct name space for local variables.)

<p>Label definitions for the statement precede this block,
so <code>10 PRINT *, I</code> is handled more like
<code>fl10: { <small>...</small> }</code> than <code>{ fl10: <small>...</small> }</code>
(where <code>fl10</code> is just a notation meaning "Fortran Label 10"
for the purposes of this document).

<h3>Statements Needing Temporaries</h3>

<p>Any temporaries needed during, but not beyond,
execution of a Fortran statement,
are made local to the scope of that statement's block.

<p>This allows the GBE to share storage for these temporaries
among the various statements without the FFE
having to manage that itself.

<p>(The GBE could, of course, decide to optimize
management of these temporaries. 
For example, it could, theoretically,
schedule some of the computations involving these temporaries
to occur in parallel. 
More practically, it might leave the storage for some temporaries
"live" beyond their scopes, to reduce the number of
manipulations of the stack pointer at run time.)

<p>Temporaries needed across distinct statement boundaries usually
are associated with Fortran blocks (such as <code>DO</code>/<code>END DO</code>). 
(Also, there might be temporaries not associated with blocks at all--these
would be in the scope of the entire program unit.)

<p>Each Fortran block <em>should</em> get its own block/scope in the GBE. 
This is best, because it allows temporaries to be more naturally handled. 
However, it might pose problems when handling labels
(in particular, when they're the targets of <code>GOTO</code>s outside the Fortran
block), and generally just hassling with replicating
parts of the <code>gcc</code> front end
(because the FFE needs to support
an arbitrary number of nested back-end blocks
if each Fortran block gets one).

<p>So, there might still be a need for top-level temporaries, whose
"owning" scope is that of the containing procedure.

<p>Also, there seems to be problems declaring new variables after
generating code (within a block) in the back end, leading to, e.g.,
<code>label not defined before binding contour</code> or similar messages,
when compiling with <code>-fstack-check</code> or
when compiling for certain targets.

<p>Because of that, and because sometimes these temporaries are not
discovered until in the middle of of generating code for an expression
statement (as in the case of the optimization for <code>X**I</code>),
it seems best to always
pre-scan all the expressions that'll be expanded for a block
before generating any of the code for that block.

<p>This pre-scan then handles discovering and declaring, to the back end,
the temporaries needed for that block.

<p>It's also important to treat distinct items in an I/O list as distinct
statements deserving their own blocks. 
That's because there's a requirement
that each I/O item be fully processed before the next one,
which matters in cases like <code>READ (*,*), I, A(I)</code>--the
element of <code>A</code> read in the second item
<em>must</em> be determined from the value
of <code>I</code> read in the first item.

<br>

<h3>Transforming DO WHILE</h3>

<p><code>DO WHILE(expr)</code> <em>must</em> be implemented
so that temporaries needed to evaluate <code>expr</code>
are generated just for the test, each time.

<p>Consider how <code>DO WHILE (A//B .NE. 'END'); <small>...</small>; END DO</code> is transformed:

<pre>for (;;)
  {
    int temp0;

    {
      char temp1[large];

      libg77_catenate (temp1, a, b);
      temp0 = libg77_ne (temp1, 'END');
    }

    if (! temp0)
      break;

    <small>...</small>
  }
</pre>

<p>In this case, it seems like a time/space tradeoff
between allocating and deallocating <code>temp1</code> for each iteration
and allocating it just once for the entire loop.

<p>However, if <code>temp1</code> is allocated just once for the entire loop,
it could be the wrong size for subsequent iterations of that loop
in cases like <code>DO WHILE (A(I:J)//B .NE. 'END')</code>,
because the body of the loop might modify <code>I</code> or <code>J</code>.

<p>So, the above implementation is used,
though a more optimal one can be used
in specific circumstances.

<br>

<h3>Transforming Iterative DO</h3>

<p>An iterative <code>DO</code> loop
(one that specifies an iteration variable)
is required by the Fortran standards
to be implemented as though an iteration count
is computed before entering the loop body,
and that iteration count used to determine
the number of times the loop body is to be performed
(assuming the loop isn't cut short via <code>GOTO</code> or <code>EXIT</code>).

<p>The FFE handles this by allocating a temporary variable
to contain the computed number of iterations. 
Since this variable must be in a scope that includes the entire loop,
a GBEL block is created for that loop,
and the variable declared as belonging to the scope of that block.

Up:<a rel=up href="#Transforming%20Statements">Transforming Statements</a>
<br>

<h3>Transforming Block IF</h3>

<p>Consider:

<pre>SUBROUTINE X(A,B,C)
CHARACTER*(*) A, B, C
LOGICAL LFUNC

IF (LFUNC (A//B)) THEN
  CALL SUBR1
ELSE IF (LFUNC (A//C)) THEN
  CALL SUBR2
ELSE
  CALL SUBR3
END
</pre>

<p>The arguments to the two calls to <code>LFUNC</code>
require dynamic allocation (at run time),
but are not required during execution of the <code>CALL</code> statements.

<p>So, the scopes of those temporaries must be within blocks inside
the block corresponding to the Fortran <code>IF</code> block.

<p>This cannot be represented "naturally"
in vanilla C, nor in GBEL. 
The <code>if</code>, <code>elseif</code>, <code>else</code>,
and <code>endif</code> constructs
provided by both languages must,
for a given <code>if</code> block,
share the same C/GBE block.

<p>Therefore, any temporaries needed during evaluation of <code>expr</code>
while executing <code>ELSE IF(expr)</code>
must either have been predeclared
at the top of the corresponding <code>IF</code> block,
or declared within a new block for that <code>ELSE IF</code>--a block that,
since it cannot contain the <code>else</code> or <code>else if</code> itself
(due to the above requirement),
actually implements the rest of the <code>IF</code> block's
<code>ELSE IF</code> and <code>ELSE</code> statements
within an inner block.

<p>The FFE takes the latter approach.

<br>

<h3>Transforming SELECT CASE</h3>

<p><code>SELECT CASE</code> poses a few interesting problems for code generation,
if efficiency and frugal stack management are important.

<p>Consider <code>SELECT CASE (I('PREFIX'//A))</code>,
where <code>A</code> is <code>CHARACTER*(*)</code>. 
In a case like this--basically,
in any case where largish temporaries are needed
to evaluate the expression--those temporaries should
not be "live" during execution of any of the <code>CASE</code> blocks.

<p>So, evaluation of the expression is best done within its own block,
which in turn is within the <code>SELECT CASE</code> block itself
(which contains the code for the CASE blocks as well,
though each within their own block).

<p>Otherwise, we'd have the rough equivalent of this pseudo-code:

<pre>{
  char temp[large];

  libg77_catenate (temp, 'prefix', a);

  switch (i (temp))
    {
    case 0:
      <small>...</small>
    }
}
</pre>

<p>And that would leave temp[large] in scope during the CASE blocks
(although a clever back end *could* see that it isn't referenced
in them, and thus free that temp before executing the blocks).

<p>So this approach is used instead:

<pre>{
  int temp0;

  {
    char temp1[large];

    libg77_catenate (temp1, 'prefix', a);
    temp0 = i (temp1);
  }

  switch (temp0)
    {
    case 0:
      <small>...</small>
    }
}
</pre>

<p>Note how <code>temp1</code> goes out of scope before starting the switch,
thus making it easy for a back end to free it.

<p>The problem <em>that</em> solution has, however,
is with <code>SELECT CASE('prefix'//A)</code>
(which is currently not supported).

<p>Unless the GBEL is extended to support arbitrarily long character strings
in its <code>case</code> facility,
the FFE has to implement <code>SELECT CASE</code> on <code>CHARACTER</code>
(probably excepting <code>CHARACTER*1</code>)
using a cascade of
<code>if</code>, <code>elseif</code>, <code>else</code>, and <code>endif</code> constructs
in GBEL.

<p>To prevent the (potentially large) temporary,
needed to hold the selected expression itself (<code>'prefix'//A</code>),
from being in scope during execution of the <code>CASE</code> blocks,
two approaches are available:

<ul>
<li>Pre-evaluate all the <code>CASE</code> tests,
producing an integer ordinal that is used,
a la <code>temp0</code> in the earlier example,
as if <code>SELECT CASE(temp0)</code> had been written.

<p>Each corresponding <code>CASE</code> is replaced with <code>CASE(<var>i</var>)</code>,
where <var>i</var> is the ordinal for that case,
determined while, or before,
generating the cascade of <code>if</code>-related constructs
to cope with <code>CHARACTER</code> selection.

</p><li>Make <code>temp0</code> above just
large enough to hold the longest <code>CASE</code> string
that'll actually be compared against the expression
(in this case, <code>'prefix'//A</code>).

<p>Since that length must be constant
(because <code>CASE</code> expressions are all constant),
it won't be so large,
and, further, <code>temp1</code> need not be dynamically allocated,
since normal <code>CHARACTER</code> assignment can be used
into the fixed-length <code>temp0</code>. 
</ul>

<p>Both of these solutions require <code>SELECT CASE</code> implementation
to be changed so all the corresponding <code>CASE</code> statements
are seen during the actual code generation for <code>SELECT CASE</code>.

<h2>Transforming Expressions</h2>

<p>The interactions between statements, expressions, and subexpressions
at program run time can be viewed as:

<pre><var>action</var>(<var>expr</var>)
</pre>

<p>Here, <var>action</var> is the series of steps
performed to effect the statement,
and <var>expr</var> is the expression
whose value is used by <var>action</var>.

<p>Expanding the above shows a typical order of events at run time:

<pre>Evaluate <var>expr</var>
Perform <var>action</var>, using result of evaluation of <var>expr</var>
Clean up after evaluating <var>expr</var>
</pre>

<p>So, if evaluating <var>expr</var> requires allocating memory,
that memory can be freed before performing <var>action</var>
only if it is not needed to hold the result of evaluating <var>expr</var>. 
Otherwise, it must be freed no sooner than
after <var>action</var> has been performed.

<p>The above are recursive definitions,
in the sense that they apply to subexpressions of <var>expr</var>.

<p>That is, evaluating <var>expr</var> involves
evaluating all of its subexpressions,
performing the <var>action</var> that computes the
result value of <var>expr</var>,
then cleaning up after evaluating those subexpressions.

<p>The recursive nature of this evaluation is implemented
via recursive-descent transformation of the top-level statements,
their expressions, <em>their</em> subexpressions, and so on.

<p>However, that recursive-descent transformation is,
due to the nature of the GBEL,
focused primarily on generating a <em>single</em> stream of code
to be executed at run time.

<p>Yet, from the above, it's clear that multiple streams of code
must effectively be simultaneously generated
during the recursive-descent analysis of statements.

<p>The primary stream implements the primary <var>action</var> items,
while at least two other streams implement
the evaluation and clean-up items.

<p>Requirements imposed by expressions include:

<ul>
<li>Whether the caller needs to have a temporary ready
to hold the value of the expression.

<li>Other stuff??? 
</ul>

<h2>Internal Naming Conventions</h2>

<p>Names exported by FFE modules have the following (regular-expression) forms. 
Note that all names beginning <code>ffe<var>mod</var></code> or <code>FFE<var>mod</var></code>,
where <var>mod</var> is lowercase or uppercase alphanumerics, respectively,
are exported by the module <code>ffe<var>mod</var></code>,
with the source code doing the exporting in <code><var>mod</var>.h</code>. 
(Usually, the source code for the implementation is in <code><var>mod</var>.c</code>.)

<p>Identifiers that don't fit the following forms
are not considered exported,
even if they are according to the C language. 
(For example, they might be made available to other modules
solely for use within expansions of exported macros,
not for use within any source code in those other modules.)

<dl>
<dt><code>ffe<var>mod</var></code>
<dd>The single typedef exported by the module.

<br><dt><code>FFE<var>umod</var>_[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]*</code>
<dd>(Where <var>umod</var> is the uppercase for of <var>mod</var>.)

<p>A <code>#define</code> or <code>enum</code> constant of the type <code>ffe<var>mod</var></code>.

<br><dt><code>ffe<var>mod</var>[A-Z][A-Z][a-z0-9]*</code>
<dd>A typedef exported by the module.

<p>The portion of the identifier after <code>ffe<var>mod</var></code> is
referred to as <code>ctype</code>, a capitalized (mixed-case) form
of <code>type</code>.

<br><dt><code>FFE<var>umod</var>_<var>type</var>[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]*[A-Z0-9]?</code>
<dd>(Where <var>umod</var> is the uppercase for of <var>mod</var>.)

<p>A <code>#define</code> or <code>enum</code> constant of the type
<code>ffe<var>mod</var><var>type</var></code>,
where <var>type</var> is the lowercase form of <var>ctype</var>
in an exported typedef.

<br><dt><code>ffe<var>mod</var>_<var>value</var></code>
<dd>A function that does or returns something,
as described by <var>value</var> (see below).

<br><dt><code>ffe<var>mod</var>_<var>value</var>_<var>input</var></code>
<dd>A function that does or returns something based
primarily on the thing described by <var>input</var> (see below).

<p>Below are names used for <var>value</var> and <var>input</var>,
along with their definitions.

<br><dt><code>file</code>
<dd>An encapsulation of a file's name.

<h1>Diagnostics</h1>

<p>Some diagnostics produced by <code>g77</code> require sufficient explanation
that the explanations are given below, and the diagnostics themselves
identify the appropriate explanation.

<p>Identification uses the GNU Info format--specifically, the <code>info</code>
command that displays the explanation is given within square
brackets in the diagnostic. 
For example:

<pre>foo.f:5: Invalid statement [info -f g77 M FOOEY]
</pre>

<p>More details about the above diagnostic is found in the <code>g77</code> Info
documentation, menu item <code>M</code>, submenu item <code>FOOEY</code>,
which is displayed by typing the UNIX command
<code>info -f g77 M FOOEY</code>.

<p>Other Info readers, such as EMACS, may be just as easily used to display
the pertinent node. 
In the above example, <code>g77</code> is the Info document name,
<code>M</code> is the top-level menu item to select,
and, in that node (named <code>Diagnostics</code>, the name of
this chapter, which is the very text you're reading now),
<code>FOOEY</code> is the menu item to select.

<h2><code>CMPAMBIG</code></h2>

<pre>Ambiguous use of intrinsic <var>intrinsic</var> <small>...</small>
</pre>

<p>The type of the argument to the invocation of the <var>intrinsic</var>
intrinsic is a <code>COMPLEX</code> type other than <code>COMPLEX(KIND=1)</code>. 
Typically, it is <code>COMPLEX(KIND=2)</code>, also known as
<code>DOUBLE COMPLEX</code>.

<p>The interpretation of this invocation depends on the particular
dialect of Fortran for which the code was written. 
Some dialects convert the real part of the argument to
<code>REAL(KIND=1)</code>, thus losing precision; other dialects,
and Fortran 90, do no such conversion.

<p>So, GNU Fortran rejects such invocations except under certain
circumstances, to avoid making an incorrect assumption that results
in generating the wrong code.

<p>To determine the dialect of the program unit, perhaps even whether
that particular invocation is properly coded, determine how the
result of the intrinsic is used.

<p>The result of <var>intrinsic</var> is expected (by the original programmer)
to be <code>REAL(KIND=1)</code> (the non-Fortran-90 interpretation) if:

<ul>
<li>It is passed as an argument to a procedure that explicitly or
implicitly declares that argument <code>REAL(KIND=1)</code>.

<p>For example,
a procedure with no <code>DOUBLE PRECISION</code> or <code>IMPLICIT DOUBLE PRECISION</code>
statement specifying the dummy argument corresponding to an
actual argument of <code>REAL(Z)</code>, where <code>Z</code> is declared
<code>DOUBLE COMPLEX</code>, strongly suggests that the programmer
expected <code>REAL(Z)</code> to return <code>REAL(KIND=1)</code> instead
of <code>REAL(KIND=2)</code>.

</p><li>It is used in a context that would otherwise not include
any <code>REAL(KIND=2)</code> but where treating the <var>intrinsic</var>
invocation as <code>REAL(KIND=2)</code> would result in unnecessary
promotions and (typically) more expensive operations on the
wider type.

<p>For example:

<pre>DOUBLE COMPLEX Z
<small>...</small>
R(1) = T * REAL(Z)
</pre>

<p>The above example suggests the programmer expected the real part
of <code>Z</code> to be converted to <code>REAL(KIND=1)</code> before being
multiplied by <code>T</code> (presumed, along with <code>R</code> above, to
be type <code>REAL(KIND=1)</code>).

<p>Otherwise, the conversion would have to be delayed until after
the multiplication, requiring not only an extra conversion
(of <code>T</code> to <code>REAL(KIND=2)</code>), but a (typically) more
expensive multiplication (a double-precision multiplication instead
of a single-precision one). 
</ul>

<p>The result of <var>intrinsic</var> is expected (by the original programmer)
to be <code>REAL(KIND=2)</code> (the Fortran 90 interpretation) if:

<ul>
<li>It is passed as an argument to a procedure that explicitly or
implicitly declares that argument <code>REAL(KIND=2)</code>.

<p>For example, a procedure specifying a <code>DOUBLE PRECISION</code>
dummy argument corresponding to an
actual argument of <code>REAL(Z)</code>, where <code>Z</code> is declared
<code>DOUBLE COMPLEX</code>, strongly suggests that the programmer
expected <code>REAL(Z)</code> to return <code>REAL(KIND=2)</code> instead
of <code>REAL(KIND=1)</code>.

</p><li>It is used in an expression context that includes
other <code>REAL(KIND=2)</code> operands,
or is assigned to a <code>REAL(KIND=2)</code> variable or array element.

<p>For example:

<pre>DOUBLE COMPLEX Z
DOUBLE PRECISION R, T
<small>...</small>
R(1) = T * REAL(Z)
</pre>

<p>The above example suggests the programmer expected the real part
of <code>Z</code> to <em>not</em> be converted to <code>REAL(KIND=1)</code>
by the <code>REAL()</code> intrinsic.

<p>Otherwise, the conversion would have to be immediately followed
by a conversion back to <code>REAL(KIND=2)</code>, losing
the original, full precision of the real part of <code>Z</code>,
before being multiplied by <code>T</code>. 
</ul>

<p>Once you have determined whether a particular invocation of <var>intrinsic</var>
expects the Fortran 90 interpretation, you can:

<ul>
<li>Change it to <code>DBLE(<var>expr</var>)</code> (if <var>intrinsic</var> is
<code>REAL</code>) or <code>DIMAG(<var>expr</var>)</code> (if <var>intrinsic</var>
is <code>AIMAG</code>)
if it expected the Fortran 90 interpretation.

<p>This assumes <var>expr</var> is <code>COMPLEX(KIND=2)</code>--if it is
some other type, such as <code>COMPLEX*32</code>, you should use the
appropriate intrinsic, such as the one to convert to <code>REAL*16</code>
(perhaps <code>DBLEQ()</code> in place of <code>DBLE()</code>, and
<code>QIMAG()</code> in place of <code>DIMAG()</code>).

</p><li>Change it to <code>REAL(<var>intrinsic</var>(<var>expr</var>))</code>,
otherwise. 
This converts to <code>REAL(KIND=1)</code> in all working
Fortran compilers. 
</ul>

<p>If you don't want to change the code, and you are certain that all
ambiguous invocations of <var>intrinsic</var> in the source file have
the same expectation regarding interpretation, you can:

<ul>
<li>Compile with the <code>g77</code> option <code>-ff90</code>, to enable the
Fortran 90 interpretation.

<li>Compile with the <code>g77</code> options <code>-fno-f90 -fugly-complex</code>,
to enable the non-Fortran-90 interpretations. 
</ul>

<p>See <a href="#REAL()%20and%20AIMAG()%20of%20Complex">REAL() and AIMAG() of Complex</a>, for more information on this
issue.

<p>Note: If the above suggestions don't produce enough evidence
as to whether a particular program expects the Fortran 90
interpretation of this ambiguous invocation of <var>intrinsic</var>,
there is one more thing you can try.

<p>If you have access to most or all the compilers used on the
program to create successfully tested and deployed executables,
read the documentation for, and <em>also</em> test out, each compiler
to determine how it treats the <var>intrinsic</var> intrinsic in
this case. 
(If all the compilers don't agree on an interpretation, there
might be lurking bugs in the deployed versions of the program.)

<p>The following sample program might help:

<pre>      PROGRAM JCB003

<h2><code>EXPIMP</code></h2>

<pre>Intrinsic <var>intrinsic</var> referenced <small>...</small>
</pre>

<p>The <var>intrinsic</var> is explicitly declared in one program
unit in the source file and implicitly used as an intrinsic
in another program unit in the same source file.

<p>This diagnostic is designed to catch cases where a program
might depend on using the name <var>intrinsic</var> as an intrinsic
in one program unit and as a global name (such as the name
of a subroutine or function) in another, but <code>g77</code> recognizes
the name as an intrinsic in both cases.

<p>After verifying that the program unit making implicit use
of the intrinsic is indeed written expecting the intrinsic,
add an <code>INTRINSIC <var>intrinsic</var></code> statement to that
program unit to prevent this warning.

<p>This and related warnings are disabled by using
the <code>-Wno-globals</code> option when compiling.

<p>Note that this warning is not issued for standard intrinsics. 
Standard intrinsics include those described in the FORTRAN 77
standard and, if <code>-ff90</code> is specified, those described
in the Fortran 90 standard. 
Such intrinsics are not as likely to be confused with user
procedures as intrinsics provided as extensions to the
standard by <code>g77</code>.

<h2><code>INTGLOB</code></h2>

<pre>Same name `<var>intrinsic</var>' given <small>...</small>
</pre>

<p>The name <var>intrinsic</var> is used for a global entity (a common
block or a program unit) in one program unit and implicitly
used as an intrinsic in another program unit.

<p>This diagnostic is designed to catch cases where a program
intends to use a name entirely as a global name, but <code>g77</code>
recognizes the name as an intrinsic in the program unit that
references the name, a situation that would likely produce
incorrect code.

<p>For example:

<pre>INTEGER FUNCTION TIME()
<small>...</small>
END
<small>...</small>
PROGRAM SAMP
INTEGER TIME
PRINT *, 'Time is ', TIME()
END
</pre>

<p>The above example defines a program unit named <code>TIME</code>, but
the reference to <code>TIME</code> in the main program unit <code>SAMP</code>
is normally treated by <code>g77</code> as a reference to the intrinsic
<code>TIME()</code> (unless a command-line option that prevents such
treatment has been specified).

<p>As a result, the program <code>SAMP</code> will <em>not</em>
invoke the <code>TIME</code> function in the same source file.

<p>Since <code>g77</code> recognizes <code>libU77</code> procedures as
intrinsics, and since some existing code uses the same names
for its own procedures as used by some <code>libU77</code>
procedures, this situation is expected to arise often enough
to make this sort of warning worth issuing.

<p>After verifying that the program unit making implicit use
of the intrinsic is indeed written expecting the intrinsic,
add an <code>INTRINSIC <var>intrinsic</var></code> statement to that
program unit to prevent this warning.

<p>Or, if you believe the program unit is designed to invoke the
program-defined procedure instead of the intrinsic (as
recognized by <code>g77</code>), add an <code>EXTERNAL <var>intrinsic</var></code>
statement to the program unit that references the name to
prevent this warning.

<p>This and related warnings are disabled by using
the <code>-Wno-globals</code> option when compiling.

<p>Note that this warning is not issued for standard intrinsics. 
Standard intrinsics include those described in the FORTRAN 77
standard and, if <code>-ff90</code> is specified, those described
in the Fortran 90 standard. 
Such intrinsics are not as likely to be confused with user
procedures as intrinsics provided as extensions to the
standard by <code>g77</code>.

<p>Although the diagnostics identify specific problems, they can
be produced when general problems such as the following occur:

<ul>
<li>The source file contains something other than Fortran code.

<p>If the code in the file does not look like many of the examples
elsewhere in this document, it might not be Fortran code. 
(Note that Fortran code often is written in lower case letters,
while the examples in this document use upper case letters,
for stylistic reasons.)

<p>For example, if the file contains lots of strange-looking
characters, it might be APL source code; if it contains lots
of parentheses, it might be Lisp source code; if it
contains lots of bugs, it might be C++ source code.

</p><li>The source file contains free-form Fortran code, but <code>-ffree-form</code>
was not specified on the command line to compile it.

<p>Free form is a newer form for Fortran code. 
The older, classic form is called fixed form.

<p>Fixed-form code is visually fairly distinctive, because
numerical labels and comments are all that appear in
the first five columns of a line, the sixth column is
reserved to denote continuation lines,
and actual statements start at or beyond column 7. 
Spaces generally are not significant, so if you
see statements such as <code>REALX,Y</code> and <code>DO10I=1,100</code>,
you are looking at fixed-form code. 
Comment lines are indicated by the letter <code>C</code> or the symbol
<code>*</code> in column 1. 
(Some code uses <code>!</code> or <code>/*</code> to begin in-line comments,
which many compilers support.)

<p>Free-form code is distinguished from fixed-form source
primarily by the fact that statements may start anywhere. 
(If lots of statements start in columns 1 through 6,
that's a strong indicator of free-form source.) 
Consecutive keywords must be separated by spaces, so
<code>REALX,Y</code> is not valid, while <code>REAL X,Y</code> is. 
There are no comment lines per se, but <code>!</code> starts a
comment anywhere in a line (other than within a character or
Hollerith constant).

<p>See <a href="#Source%20Form">Source Form</a>, for more information.

</p><li>The source file is in fixed form and has been edited without
sensitivity to the column requirements.

<p>Statements in fixed-form code must be entirely contained within
columns 7 through 72 on a given line. 
Starting them "early" is more likely to result in diagnostics
than finishing them "late", though both kinds of errors are
often caught at compile time.

<p>For example, if the following code fragment is edited by following
the commented instructions literally, the result, shown afterward,
would produce a diagnostic when compiled:

<pre>C On XYZZY systems, remove "C" on next line:
C     CALL XYZZY_RESET
</pre>

<p>The result of editing the above line might be:

<pre>C On XYZZY systems, remove "C" on next line:
     CALL XYZZY_RESET
</pre>

<p>However, that leaves the first <code>C</code> in the <code>CALL</code>
statement in column 6, making it a comment line, which is
not really what the author intended, and which is likely
to result in one of the above-listed diagnostics.

<p><em>Replacing</em> the <code>C</code> in column 1 with a space
is the proper change to make, to ensure the <code>CALL</code>
keyword starts in or after column 7.

<p>Another common mistake like this is to forget that fixed-form
source lines are significant through only column 72, and that,
normally, any text beyond column 72 is ignored or is diagnosed
at compile time.

<p>See <a href="#Source%20Form">Source Form</a>, for more information.

</p><li>The source file requires preprocessing, and the preprocessing
is not being specified at compile time.

<p>A source file containing lines beginning with <code>#define</code>,
<code>#include</code>, <code>#if</code>, and so on is likely one that
requires preprocessing.

<p>If the file's suffix is <code>.f</code>, <code>.for</code>, or <code>.FOR</code>,
the file normally will be compiled <em>without</em> preprocessing
by <code>g77</code>.

<p>Change the file's suffix from <code>.f</code> to <code>.F</code>
(or, on systems with case-insensitive file names,
to <code>.fpp</code> or <code>.FPP</code>),
from <code>.for</code> to <code>.fpp</code>,
or from <code>.FOR</code> to <code>.FPP</code>. 
<code>g77</code> compiles files with such names <em>with</em>
preprocessing.

<p>Or, learn how to use <code>gcc</code>'s <code>-x</code> option to specify
the language <code>f77-cpp-input</code> for Fortran files that
require preprocessing. 
See <a href="Using and Porting GNU CC.html#gcc">Overall Options</a>.

</p><li>The source file is preprocessed, and the results of preprocessing
result in syntactic errors that are not necessarily obvious to
someone examining the source file itself.

<p>Examples of errors resulting from preprocessor macro expansion
include exceeding the line-length limit, improperly starting,
terminating, or incorporating the apostrophe or double-quote in
a character constant, improperly forming a Hollerith constant,
and so on.

<p>See <a href="#Overall%20Options">Options Controlling the Kind of Output</a>,
for suggestions about how to use, and not use, preprocessing
for Fortran code.

<p>These messages all identify disagreements about the
global procedure named <var>name</var> among different program units
(usually including <var>name</var> itself).

<p>Whether a particular disagreement is reported
as a warning or an error
can depend on the relative order
of the disagreeing portions of the source file.

<p>Disagreements between a procedure invocation
and the <em>subsequent</em> procedure itself
are, usually, diagnosed as errors
when the procedure itself <em>precedes</em> the invocation. 
Other disagreements are diagnosed via warnings.

<p>This distinction, between warnings and errors,
is due primarily to the present tendency of the <code>gcc</code> back end
to inline only those procedure invocations that are
<em>preceded</em> by the corresponding procedure definitions. 
If the <code>gcc</code> back end is changed
to inline "forward references",
in which invocations precede definitions,
the <code>g77</code> front end will be changed
to treat both orderings as errors, accordingly.

<p>The sorts of disagreements that are diagnosed by <code>g77</code> include
whether a procedure is a subroutine or function;
if it is a function, the type of the return value of the procedure;
the number of arguments the procedure accepts;
and the type of each argument.

<p>Disagreements regarding global names among program units
in a Fortran program <em>should</em> be fixed in the code itself. 
However, if that is not immediately practical,
and the code has been working for some time,
it is possible it will work
when compiled with the <code>-fno-globals</code> option.

<p>The <code>-fno-globals</code> option
causes these diagnostics to all be warnings
and disables all inlining of references to global procedures
(to avoid subsequent compiler crashes and bad-code generation). 
Use of the <code>-Wno-globals</code> option as well as <code>-fno-globals</code>
suppresses all of these diagnostics. 
(<code>-Wno-globals</code> by itself disables only the warnings,
not the errors.)

<p>After using <code>-fno-globals</code> to work around these problems,
it is wise to stop using that option and address them by fixing
the Fortran code, because such problems, while they might not
actually result in bugs on some systems, indicate that the code
is not as portable as it could be. 
In particular, the code might appear to work on a particular
system, but have bugs that affect the reliability of the data
without exhibiting any other outward manifestations of the bugs.

<h2><code>LINKFAIL</code></h2>

<pre>If the above command failed due to an unresolved reference
to strtoul, _strtoul, bsearch, _bsearch, or similar, see
[info -f g77 M LINKFAIL] (a node in the g77 documentation)
for information on what causes this, how to work around
the problem by editing ${srcdir}/proj.c, and what else to do.
</pre>

<p>See <a href="#Missing%20strtoul%20or%20bsearch">Missing strtoul or bsearch</a>, for more information on
this problem,
which occurs only in releases of <code>g77</code>
based on <code>gcc</code>. 
(It does not occur in <code>egcs</code>.)

<p>On AIX 4.1, <code>g77</code> might not build with the native (non-GNU) tools
due to a linker bug in coping with the <code>-bbigtoc</code> option which
leads to a <code>Relocation overflow</code> error.  The GNU linker is not
recommended on current AIX versions, though; it was developed under a
now-unsupported version.  This bug is said to be fixed by `update PTF
U455193 for APAR IX75823'.

<p>Compiling with <code>-mminimal-toc</code>
might solve this problem, e.g. by adding
<pre>BOOT_CFLAGS='-mminimal-toc -O2 -g'
</pre>
to the <code>make bootstrap</code> command line.

<p><dfn>loop discovery</dfn> refers to the
process by which a compiler, or indeed any reader of a program,
determines which portions of the program are more likely to be executed
repeatedly as it is being run.  Such discovery typically is done early
when compiling using optimization techniques, so the "discovered"
loops get more attention--and more run-time resources, such as
registers--from the compiler.  It is easy to "discover" loops that are
constructed out of looping constructs in the language
(such as Fortran's <code>DO</code>).  For some programs, "discovering" loops
constructed out of lower-level constructs (such as <code>IF</code> and
<code>GOTO</code>) can lead to generation of more optimal code
than otherwise.</p>

<p>The files generated like this can also be used for
inter-unit consistency checking of dummy and actual arguments, although
the <code>ftnchek</code> tool from <a href="ftp://ftp.netlib.org/fortran">ftp://ftp.netlib.org/fortran</a>
or <a href="ftp://ftp.dsm.fordham.edu">ftp://ftp.dsm.fordham.edu</a> is
probably better for this purpose.</p>

<p>No, not <em>that</em> one.</p>
