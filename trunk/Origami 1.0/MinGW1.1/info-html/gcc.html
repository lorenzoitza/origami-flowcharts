<h1>Compile C, C++, Objective C, or Fortran</h1>

<p>The C, C++, and Objective C, and Fortran versions of the compiler are
integrated; this is why we use the name "GNU Compiler Collection". 
GCC can compile programs written in C, C++, Objective C, or Fortran. 
The Fortran compiler is described in a separate manual.

<p>"GCC" is a common shorthand term for the GNU Compiler Collection.  This is both
the most general name for the compiler, and the name used when the
emphasis is on compiling C programs (as the abbreviation formerly
stood for "GNU C Compiler").

<p>When referring to C++ compilation, it is usual to call the compiler
"G++".  Since there is only one compiler, it is also accurate to call
it "GCC" no matter what the language context; however, the term
"G++" is more useful when the emphasis is on compiling C++ programs.

<p>We use the name "GCC" to refer to the compilation system as a
whole, and more specifically to the language-independent part of the
compiler.  For example, we refer to the optimization options as
affecting the behavior of "GCC" or sometimes just "the compiler".

<p>Front ends for other languages, such as Ada 9X, Fortran, Modula-3, and
Pascal, are under development.  These front-ends, like that for C++, are
built in subdirectories of GCC and link to it.  The result is an
integrated compiler that can compile programs written in C, C++,
Objective C, or any of the languages for which you have installed front
ends.

<p>In this manual, we only discuss the options for the C, Objective-C, and
C++ compilers and those of the GCC core.  Consult the documentation
of the other front ends for the options to use when compiling programs
written in other languages.

<p>G++ is a <em>compiler</em>, not merely a preprocessor.  G++ builds object
code directly from your C++ program source.  There is no intermediate C
version of the program.  (By contrast, for example, some other
implementations use a program that generates a C program from your C++
source.)  Avoiding an intermediate C representation of the program means
that you get better object code, and better debugging information.  The
GNU debugger, GDB, works with this information in the object code to
give you comprehensive C++ source-level editing capabilities
(see <a href="gdb.info.html#C%20and%20C++">C</a>).

<h1>GCC Command Options</h1>

<p>When you invoke GCC, it normally does preprocessing, compilation,
assembly and linking.  The "overall options" allow you to stop this
process at an intermediate stage.  For example, the <code>-c</code> option
says not to run the linker.  Then the output consists of object files
output by the assembler.

<p>Other options are passed on to one stage of processing.  Some options
control the preprocessor and others the compiler itself.  Yet other
options control the assembler and linker; most of these are not
documented here, since you rarely need to use any of them.

<p>Most of the command line options that you can use with GCC are useful
for C programs; when an option is only useful with another language
(usually C++), the explanation says so explicitly.  If the description
for a particular option does not mention a source language, you can use
that option with all supported languages.

<p>See <a href="#Invoking%20G++">Compiling C++ Programs</a>, for a summary of special
options for compiling C++ programs.

<p>The <code>gcc</code> program accepts options and file names as operands.  Many
options have multiletter names; therefore multiple single-letter options
may <em>not</em> be grouped: <code>-dr</code> is very different from <code>-d&nbsp;-r</code>.

<p>You can mix options and other arguments.  For the most part, the order
you use doesn't matter.  Order does matter when you use several options
of the same kind; for example, if you specify <code>-L</code> more than once,
the directories are searched in the order specified.

<p>Many options have long names starting with <code>-f</code> or with
<code>-W</code>--for example, <code>-fforce-mem</code>,
<code>-fstrength-reduce</code>, <code>-Wformat</code> and so on.  Most of
these have both positive and negative forms; the negative form of
<code>-ffoo</code> would be <code>-fno-foo</code>.  This manual documents
only one of these two forms, whichever one is not the default.

<h2>Options Controlling the Kind of Output</h2>

<p>Compilation can involve up to four stages: preprocessing, compilation
proper, assembly and linking, always in that order.  The first three
stages apply to an individual source file, and end by producing an
object file; linking combines all the object files (those newly
compiled, and those specified as input) into an executable file.

<p>For any given input file, the file name suffix determines what kind of
compilation is done:

<dl>
<dt><code><var>file</var>.c</code>
<dd>C source code which must be preprocessed.

<br><dt><code><var>file</var>.i</code>
<dd>C source code which should not be preprocessed.

<br><dt><code><var>file</var>.ii</code>
<dd>C++ source code which should not be preprocessed.

<br><dt><code><var>file</var>.m</code>
<dd>Objective-C source code.  Note that you must link with the library
<code>libobjc.a</code> to make an Objective-C program work.

<br><dt><code><var>file</var>.h</code>
<dd>C header file (not to be compiled or linked).

<br><dt><code><var>file</var>.cc</code>
<dt><code><var>file</var>.cxx</code>
<dt><code><var>file</var>.cpp</code>
<dt><code><var>file</var>.C</code>
<dd>C++ source code which must be preprocessed.  Note that in <code>.cxx</code>,
the last two letters must both be literally <code>x</code>.  Likewise,
<code>.C</code> refers to a literal capital C.

<br><dt><code><var>file</var>.s</code>
<dd>Assembler code.

<br><dt><code><var>file</var>.S</code>
<dd>Assembler code which must be preprocessed.

<br><dt><code><var>other</var></code>
<dd>An object file to be fed straight into linking. 
Any file name with no recognized suffix is treated this way. 
</dl>

<p>You can specify the input language explicitly with the <code>-x</code> option:

<dl>
<dt><code>-x <var>language</var></code>
<dd>Specify explicitly the <var>language</var> for the following input files
(rather than letting the compiler choose a default based on the file
name suffix).  This option applies to all following input files until
the next <code>-x</code> option.  Possible values for <var>language</var> are:
<pre>c  objective-c  c++
c-header  cpp-output  c++-cpp-output
assembler  assembler-with-cpp
</pre>

<br><dt><code>-x none</code>
<dd>Turn off any specification of a language, so that subsequent files are
handled according to their file name suffixes (as they are if <code>-x</code>
has not been used at all). 
</dl>

<p>If you only want some of the stages of compilation, you can use
<code>-x</code> (or filename suffixes) to tell <code>gcc</code> where to start, and
one of the options <code>-c</code>, <code>-S</code>, or <code>-E</code> to say where
<code>gcc</code> is to stop.  Note that some combinations (for example,
<code>-x cpp-output -E</code> instruct <code>gcc</code> to do nothing at all.

<dl>
<dt><code>-c</code>
<dd>Compile or assemble the source files, but do not link.  The linking
stage simply is not done.  The ultimate output is in the form of an
object file for each source file.

<p>By default, the object file name for a source file is made by replacing
the suffix <code>.c</code>, <code>.i</code>, <code>.s</code>, etc., with <code>.o</code>.

<p>Unrecognized input files, not requiring compilation or assembly, are
ignored.

<br><dt><code>-S</code>
<dd>Stop after the stage of compilation proper; do not assemble.  The output
is in the form of an assembler code file for each non-assembler input
file specified.

<p>By default, the assembler file name for a source file is made by
replacing the suffix <code>.c</code>, <code>.i</code>, etc., with <code>.s</code>.

<p>Input files that don't require compilation are ignored.

<br><dt><code>-E</code>
<dd>Stop after the preprocessing stage; do not run the compiler proper.  The
output is in the form of preprocessed source code, which is sent to the
standard output.

<p>Input files which don't require preprocessing are ignored.

<br><dt><code>-o <var>file</var></code>
<dd>Place output in file <var>file</var>.  This applies regardless to whatever
sort of output is being produced, whether it be an executable file,
an object file, an assembler file or preprocessed C code.

<p>Since only one output file can be specified, it does not make sense to
use <code>-o</code> when compiling more than one input file, unless you are
producing an executable file as output.

<p>If <code>-o</code> is not specified, the default is to put an executable file
in <code>a.out</code>, the object file for <code><var>source</var>.<var>suffix</var></code> in
<code><var>source</var>.o</code>, its assembler file in <code><var>source</var>.s</code>, and
all preprocessed C source on standard output.

<br><dt><code>-v</code>
<dd>Print (on standard error output) the commands executed to run the stages
of compilation.  Also print the version number of the compiler driver
program and of the preprocessor and the compiler proper.

<br><dt><code>-pipe</code>
<dd>Use pipes rather than temporary files for communication between the
various stages of compilation.  This fails to work on some systems where
the assembler is unable to read from a pipe; but the GNU assembler has
no trouble.

<br><dt><code>--help</code>
<dd>Print (on the standard output) a description of the command line options
understood by <code>gcc</code>.  If the <code>-v</code> option is also specified
then <code>--help</code> will also be passed on to the various processes
invoked by <code>gcc</code>, so that they can display the command line options
they accept.  If the <code>-W</code> option is also specified then command
line options which have no documentation associated with them will also
be displayed.

<h2>Compiling C++ Programs</h2>

<p>C++ source files conventionally use one of the suffixes <code>.C</code>,
<code>.cc</code>, <code>.cpp</code>, <code>.c++</code>, <code>.cp</code>, or <code>.cxx</code>;
preprocessed C++ files use the suffix <code>.ii</code>.  GCC recognizes
files with these names and compiles them as C++ programs even if you
call the compiler the same way as for compiling C programs (usually with
the name <code>gcc</code>).

<p>However, C++ programs often require class libraries as well as a
compiler that understands the C++ language--and under some
circumstances, you might want to compile programs from standard input,
or otherwise without a suffix that flags them as C++ programs. 
<code>g++</code> is a program that calls GCC with the default language
set to C++, and automatically specifies linking against the C++
library.  On many systems, the script <code>g++</code> is also
installed with the name <code>c++</code>.

<p>When you compile C++ programs, you may specify many of the same
command-line options that you use for compiling programs in any
language; or command-line options meaningful for C and related
languages; or options that are meaningful only for C++ programs. 
See <a href="#C%20Dialect%20Options">Options Controlling C Dialect</a>, for
explanations of options for languages related to C. 
See <a href="#C++%20Dialect%20Options">Options Controlling C++ Dialect</a>, for
explanations of options that are meaningful only for C++ programs.

<h2>Options Controlling C Dialect</h2>

<p>The following options control the dialect of C (or languages derived
from C, such as C++ and Objective C) that the compiler accepts:

<dl>
<dt><code>-ansi</code>
<dd>In C mode, support all ANSI standard C programs.  In C++ mode,
remove GNU extensions that conflict with ANSI C++.

<p>This turns off certain features of GCC that are incompatible with ANSI
C (when compiling C code), or of ANSI standard C++ (when compiling C++ code),
such as the <code>asm</code> and <code>typeof</code> keywords, and
predefined macros such as <code>unix</code> and <code>vax</code> that identify the
type of system you are using.  It also enables the undesirable and
rarely used ANSI trigraph feature.  For the C compiler,
it disables recognition of C++ style <code>//</code> comments as well as
the <code>inline</code> keyword.  For the C++ compiler,
<code>-foperator-names</code> is enabled as well.

<p>The alternate keywords <code>__asm__</code>, <code>__extension__</code>,
<code>__inline__</code> and <code>__typeof__</code> continue to work despite
<code>-ansi</code>.  You would not want to use them in an ANSI C program, of
course, but it is useful to put them in header files that might be included
in compilations done with <code>-ansi</code>.  Alternate predefined macros
such as <code>__unix__</code> and <code>__vax__</code> are also available, with or
without <code>-ansi</code>.

<p>The <code>-ansi</code> option does not cause non-ANSI programs to be
rejected gratuitously.  For that, <code>-pedantic</code> is required in
addition to <code>-ansi</code>.  See <a href="#Warning%20Options">Warning Options</a>.

<p>The macro <code>__STRICT_ANSI__</code> is predefined when the <code>-ansi</code>
option is used.  Some header files may notice this macro and refrain
from declaring certain functions or defining certain macros that the
ANSI standard doesn't call for; this is to avoid interfering with any
programs that might use these names for other things.

<p>The functions <code>alloca</code>, <code>abort</code>, <code>exit</code>, and
<code>_exit</code> are not builtin functions when <code>-ansi</code> is used.

<br><dt><code>-fstd=</code>
<dd>Determine the language standard.  A value for this option must be provided;
possible values are

<ul>
<li>iso9899:1990
Same as -ansi

<li>iso9899:199409
ISO C as modified in amend. 1

<li>iso9899:199x
ISO C 9x

<li>c89
same as -std=iso9899:1990

<li>c9x
same as -std=iso9899:199x

<li>gnu89
default, iso9899:1990 + gnu extensions

<li>gnu9x
iso9899:199x + gnu extensions
</ul>

<p>Even when this option is not specified, you can still use some of the
features of newer standards in so far as they do not conflict with
previous C standards.  For example, you may use <code>__restrict__</code> even
when -fstd=c9x is not specified.

<br><dt><code>-fno-asm</code>
<dd>Do not recognize <code>asm</code>, <code>inline</code> or <code>typeof</code> as a
keyword, so that code can use these words as identifiers.  You can use
the keywords <code>__asm__</code>, <code>__inline__</code> and <code>__typeof__</code>
instead.  <code>-ansi</code> implies <code>-fno-asm</code>.

<p>In C++, this switch only affects the <code>typeof</code> keyword, since
<code>asm</code> and <code>inline</code> are standard keywords.  You may want to
use the <code>-fno-gnu-keywords</code> flag instead, as it also disables the
other, C++-specific, extension keywords such as <code>headof</code>.

<br><dt><code>-fno-builtin</code>
<dd>Don't recognize builtin functions that do not begin with <code>__builtin_</code>
as prefix.  Currently, the functions affected include <code>abort</code>,
<code>abs</code>, <code>alloca</code>, <code>cos</code>, <code>exit</code>, <code>fabs</code>,
<code>ffs</code>, <code>labs</code>, <code>memcmp</code>, <code>memcpy</code>, <code>sin</code>,
<code>sqrt</code>, <code>strcmp</code>, <code>strcpy</code>, and <code>strlen</code>.

<p>GCC normally generates special code to handle certain builtin functions
more efficiently; for instance, calls to <code>alloca</code> may become single
instructions that adjust the stack directly, and calls to <code>memcpy</code>
may become inline copy loops.  The resulting code is often both smaller
and faster, but since the function calls no longer appear as such, you
cannot set a breakpoint on those calls, nor can you change the behavior
of the functions by linking with a different library.

<p>The <code>-ansi</code> option prevents <code>alloca</code> and <code>ffs</code> from being
builtin functions, since these functions do not have an ANSI standard
meaning.

<br><dt><code>-fhosted</code>
<dd>

<p>Assert that compilation takes place in a hosted environment.  This implies
<code>-fbuiltin</code>.  A hosted environment is one in which the
entire standard library is available, and in which <code>main</code> has a return
type of <code>int</code>.  Examples are nearly everything except a kernel. 
This is equivalent to <code>-fno-freestanding</code>.

<br><dt><code>-ffreestanding</code>
<dd>

<p>Assert that compilation takes place in a freestanding environment.  This
implies <code>-fno-builtin</code>.  A freestanding environment
is one in which the standard library may not exist, and program startup may
not necessarily be at <code>main</code>.  The most obvious example is an OS kernel. 
This is equivalent to <code>-fno-hosted</code>.

<br><dt><code>-trigraphs</code>
<dd>Support ANSI C trigraphs.  You don't want to know about this
brain-damage.  The <code>-ansi</code> option implies <code>-trigraphs</code>.

<br><dt><code>-traditional</code>
<dd>Attempt to support some aspects of traditional C compilers. 
Specifically:

<ul>
<li>All <code>extern</code> declarations take effect globally even if they
are written inside of a function definition.  This includes implicit
declarations of functions.

<li>The newer keywords <code>typeof</code>, <code>inline</code>, <code>signed</code>, <code>const</code>
and <code>volatile</code> are not recognized.  (You can still use the
alternative keywords such as <code>__typeof__</code>, <code>__inline__</code>, and
so on.)

<li>Comparisons between pointers and integers are always allowed.

<li>Integer types <code>unsigned short</code> and <code>unsigned char</code> promote
to <code>unsigned int</code>.

<li>Out-of-range floating point literals are not an error.

<li>Certain constructs which ANSI regards as a single invalid preprocessing
number, such as <code>0xe-0xd</code>, are treated as expressions instead.

<li>String "constants" are not necessarily constant; they are stored in
writable space, and identical looking constants are allocated
separately.  (This is the same as the effect of
<code>-fwritable-strings</code>.)

<li>All automatic variables not declared <code>register</code> are preserved by
<code>longjmp</code>.  Ordinarily, GNU C follows ANSI C: automatic variables
not declared <code>volatile</code> may be clobbered.

<li>The character escape sequences <code>\x</code> and <code>\a</code> evaluate as the
literal characters <code>x</code> and <code>a</code> respectively.  Without
<code>-traditional</code>, <code>\x</code> is a prefix for the hexadecimal
representation of a character, and <code>\a</code> produces a bell. 
</ul>

<p>You may wish to use <code>-fno-builtin</code> as well as <code>-traditional</code>
if your program uses names that are normally GNU C builtin functions for
other purposes of its own.

<p>You cannot use <code>-traditional</code> if you include any header files that
rely on ANSI C features.  Some vendors are starting to ship systems with
ANSI C header files and you cannot use <code>-traditional</code> on such
systems to compile files that include any system headers.

<p>The <code>-traditional</code> option also enables <code>-traditional-cpp</code>,
which is described next.

<br><dt><code>-traditional-cpp</code>
<dd>Attempt to support some aspects of traditional C preprocessors. 
Specifically:

<ul>
<li>Comments convert to nothing at all, rather than to a space.  This allows
traditional token concatenation.

<li>In a preprocessing directive, the <code>#</code> symbol must appear as the first
character of a line.

<li>Macro arguments are recognized within string constants in a macro
definition (and their values are stringified, though without additional
quote marks, when they appear in such a context).  The preprocessor
always considers a string constant to end at a newline.

<li>The predefined macro <code>__STDC__</code> is not defined when you use
<code>-traditional</code>, but <code>__GNUC__</code> is (since the GNU extensions
which <code>__GNUC__</code> indicates are not affected by
<code>-traditional</code>).  If you need to write header files that work
differently depending on whether <code>-traditional</code> is in use, by
testing both of these predefined macros you can distinguish four
situations: GNU C, traditional GNU C, other ANSI C compilers, and other
old C compilers.  The predefined macro <code>__STDC_VERSION__</code> is also
not defined when you use <code>-traditional</code>.  See <a href="cpp.info.html#Standard%20Predefined%20Macros">Standard Predefined</a>,
for more discussion of these and other predefined macros.

<li>The preprocessor considers a string constant to end at a newline (unless
the newline is escaped with <code>\</code>).  (Without <code>-traditional</code>,
string constants can contain the newline character as typed.) 
</ul>

<br><dt><code>-fcond-mismatch</code>
<dd>Allow conditional expressions with mismatched types in the second and
third arguments.  The value of such an expression is void.

<br><dt><code>-funsigned-char</code>
<dd>Let the type <code>char</code> be unsigned, like <code>unsigned char</code>.

<p>Each kind of machine has a default for what <code>char</code> should
be.  It is either like <code>unsigned char</code> by default or like
<code>signed char</code> by default.

<p>Ideally, a portable program should always use <code>signed char</code> or
<code>unsigned char</code> when it depends on the signedness of an object. 
But many programs have been written to use plain <code>char</code> and
expect it to be signed, or expect it to be unsigned, depending on the
machines they were written for.  This option, and its inverse, let you
make such a program work with the opposite default.

<p>The type <code>char</code> is always a distinct type from each of
<code>signed char</code> or <code>unsigned char</code>, even though its behavior
is always just like one of those two.

<br><dt><code>-fsigned-char</code>
<dd>Let the type <code>char</code> be signed, like <code>signed char</code>.

<p>Note that this is equivalent to <code>-fno-unsigned-char</code>, which is
the negative form of <code>-funsigned-char</code>.  Likewise, the option
<code>-fno-signed-char</code> is equivalent to <code>-funsigned-char</code>.

<p>You may wish to use <code>-fno-builtin</code> as well as <code>-traditional</code>
if your program uses names that are normally GNU C builtin functions for
other purposes of its own.

<p>You cannot use <code>-traditional</code> if you include any header files that
rely on ANSI C features.  Some vendors are starting to ship systems with
ANSI C header files and you cannot use <code>-traditional</code> on such
systems to compile files that include any system headers.

<br><dt><code>-fsigned-bitfields</code>
<dt><code>-funsigned-bitfields</code>
<dt><code>-fno-signed-bitfields</code>
<dt><code>-fno-unsigned-bitfields</code>
<dd>These options control whether a bitfield is signed or unsigned, when the
declaration does not use either <code>signed</code> or <code>unsigned</code>.  By
default, such a bitfield is signed, because this is consistent: the
basic integer types such as <code>int</code> are signed types.

<p>However, when <code>-traditional</code> is used, bitfields are all unsigned
no matter what.

<br><dt><code>-fwritable-strings</code>
<dd>Store string constants in the writable data segment and don't uniquize
them.  This is for compatibility with old programs which assume they can
write into string constants.  The option <code>-traditional</code> also has
this effect.

<p>Writing into string constants is a very bad idea; "constants" should
be constant.

<br><dt><code>-fallow-single-precision</code>
<dd>Do not promote single precision math operations to double precision,
even when compiling with <code>-traditional</code>.

<p>Traditional K&amp;R C promotes all floating point operations to double
precision, regardless of the sizes of the operands.   On the
architecture for which you are compiling, single precision may be faster
than double precision.   If you must use <code>-traditional</code>, but want
to use single precision operations when the operands are single
precision, use this option.   This option has no effect when compiling
with ANSI or GNU C conventions (the default).

<h2>Options Controlling C++ Dialect</h2>

<p>This section describes the command-line options that are only meaningful
for C++ programs; but you can also use most of the GNU compiler options
regardless of what language your program is in.  For example, you
might compile a file <code>firstClass.C</code> like this:

<pre>g++ -g -frepo -O -c firstClass.C
</pre>

<p>In this example, only <code>-frepo</code> is an option meant
only for C++ programs; you can use the other options with any
language supported by GCC.

<p>Here is a list of options that are <em>only</em> for compiling C++ programs:

<dl>
<dt><code>-fno-access-control</code>
<dd>Turn off all access checking.  This switch is mainly useful for working
around bugs in the access control code.

<br><dt><code>-fcheck-new</code>
<dd>Check that the pointer returned by <code>operator new</code> is non-null
before attempting to modify the storage allocated.  The current Working
Paper requires that <code>operator new</code> never return a null pointer, so
this check is normally unnecessary.

<p>An alternative to using this option is to specify that your
<code>operator new</code> does not throw any exceptions; if you declare it
<code>throw()</code>, g++ will check the return value.  See also <code>new
(nothrow)</code>.

<br><dt><code>-fconserve-space</code>
<dd>Put uninitialized or runtime-initialized global variables into the
common segment, as C does.  This saves space in the executable at the
cost of not diagnosing duplicate definitions.  If you compile with this
flag and your program mysteriously crashes after <code>main()</code> has
completed, you may have an object that is being destroyed twice because
two definitions were merged.

<p>This option is no longer useful on most targets, now that support has
been added for putting variables into BSS without making them common.

<br><dt><code>-fdollars-in-identifiers</code>
<dd>Accept <code>$</code> in identifiers.  You can also explicitly prohibit use of
<code>$</code> with the option <code>-fno-dollars-in-identifiers</code>.  (GNU C allows
<code>$</code> by default on most target systems, but there are a few exceptions.) 
Traditional C allowed the character <code>$</code> to form part of
identifiers.  However, ANSI C and C++ forbid <code>$</code> in identifiers.

<br><dt><code>-fno-elide-constructors</code>
<dd>The C++ standard allows an implementation to omit creating a temporary
which is only used to initialize another object of the same type. 
Specifying this option disables that optimization, and forces g++ to
call the copy constructor in all cases.

<br><dt><code>-fexternal-templates</code>
<dd>Cause template instantiations to obey <code>#pragma interface</code> and
<code>implementation</code>; template instances are emitted or not according
to the location of the template definition.  See <a href="#Template%20Instantiation">Template Instantiation</a>, for more information.

<p>This option is deprecated.

<br><dt><code>-falt-external-templates</code>
<dd>Similar to -fexternal-templates, but template instances are emitted or
not according to the place where they are first instantiated. 
See <a href="#Template%20Instantiation">Template Instantiation</a>, for more information.

<p>This option is deprecated.

<br><dt><code>-ffor-scope</code>
<dt><code>-fno-for-scope</code>
<dd>If -ffor-scope is specified, the scope of variables declared in
a <i>for-init-statement</i> is limited to the <code>for</code> loop itself,
as specified by the draft C++ standard. 
If -fno-for-scope is specified, the scope of variables declared in
a <i>for-init-statement</i> extends to the end of the enclosing scope,
as was the case in old versions of gcc, and other (traditional)
implementations of C++.

<p>The default if neither flag is given to follow the standard,
but to allow and give a warning for old-style code that would
otherwise be invalid, or have different behavior.

<br><dt><code>-fno-gnu-keywords</code>
<dd>Do not recognize <code>classof</code>, <code>headof</code>, <code>signature</code>,
<code>sigof</code> or <code>typeof</code> as a keyword, so that code can use these
words as identifiers.  You can use the keywords <code>__classof__</code>,
<code>__headof__</code>, <code>__signature__</code>, <code>__sigof__</code>, and
<code>__typeof__</code> instead.  <code>-ansi</code> implies
<code>-fno-gnu-keywords</code>.

<br><dt><code>-fguiding-decls</code>
<dd>Treat a function declaration with the same type as a potential function
template instantiation as though it declares that instantiation, not a
normal function.  If a definition is given for the function later in the
translation unit (or another translation unit if the target supports
weak symbols), that definition will be used; otherwise the template will
be instantiated.  This behavior reflects the C++ language prior to
September 1996, when guiding declarations were removed.

<p>This option implies <code>-fname-mangling-version-0</code>, and will not work
with other name mangling versions.  Like all options that change the
ABI, all C++ code, <em>including libgcc.a</em> must be built with the same
setting of this option.

<br><dt><code>-fhandle-signatures</code>
<dd>Recognize the <code>signature</code> and <code>sigof</code> keywords for specifying
abstract types.  The default (<code>-fno-handle-signatures</code>) is not to
recognize them.  See <a href="#C++%20Signatures">Type Abstraction using Signatures</a>.

<br><dt><code>-fhonor-std</code>
<dd>Treat the <code>namespace std</code> as a namespace, instead of ignoring
it. For compatibility with earlier versions of g++, the compiler will,
by default, ignore <code>namespace-declarations</code>,
<code>using-declarations</code>, <code>using-directives</code>, and
<code>namespace-names</code>, if they involve <code>std</code>.

<br><dt><code>-fhuge-objects</code>
<dd>Support virtual function calls for objects that exceed the size
representable by a <code>short int</code>.  Users should not use this flag by
default; if you need to use it, the compiler will tell you so.

<p>This flag is not useful when compiling with -fvtable-thunks.

<p>Like all options that change the ABI, all C++ code, <em>including
libgcc</em> must be built with the same setting of this option.

<br><dt><code>-fno-implicit-templates</code>
<dd>Never emit code for non-inline templates which are instantiated
implicitly (i.e. by use); only emit code for explicit instantiations. 
See <a href="#Template%20Instantiation">Template Instantiation</a>, for more information.

<br><dt><code>-fno-implicit-inline-templates</code>
<dd>Don't emit code for implicit instantiations of inline templates, either. 
The default is to handle inlines differently so that compiles with and
without optimization will need the same set of explicit instantiations.

<br><dt><code>-finit-priority</code>
<dd>Support <code>__attribute__ ((init_priority (n)))</code> for controlling the
order of initialization of file-scope objects.  On ELF targets, this
requires GNU ld 2.10 or later.

<br><dt><code>-fno-implement-inlines</code>
<dd>To save space, do not emit out-of-line copies of inline functions
controlled by <code>#pragma implementation</code>.  This will cause linker
errors if these functions are not inlined everywhere they are called.

<br><dt><code>-fname-mangling-version-<var>n</var></code>
<dd>Control the way in which names are mangled.  Version 0 is compatible
with versions of g++ before 2.8.  Version 1 is the default.  Version 1
will allow correct mangling of function templates.  For example,
version 0 mangling does not mangle foo&lt;int, double&gt; and foo&lt;int, char&gt;
given this declaration:

<pre>template &lt;class T, class U&gt; void foo(T t);
</pre>

<p>Like all options that change the ABI, all C++ code, <em>including
libgcc</em> must be built with the same setting of this option.

<br><dt><code>-foperator-names</code>
<dd>Recognize the operator name keywords <code>and</code>, <code>bitand</code>,
<code>bitor</code>, <code>compl</code>, <code>not</code>, <code>or</code> and <code>xor</code> as
synonyms for the symbols they refer to.  <code>-ansi</code> implies
<code>-foperator-names</code>.

<br><dt><code>-fno-optional-diags</code>
<dd>Disable diagnostics that the standard says a compiler does not need to
issue.  Currently, the only such diagnostic issued by g++ is the one for
a name having multiple meanings within a class.

<br><dt><code>-fpermissive</code>
<dd>Downgrade messages about nonconformant code from errors to warnings.  By
default, g++ effectively sets <code>-pedantic-errors</code> without
<code>-pedantic</code>; this option reverses that.  This behavior and this
option are superceded by <code>-pedantic</code>, which works as it does for GNU C.

<br><dt><code>-frepo</code>
<dd>Enable automatic template instantiation.  This option also implies
<code>-fno-implicit-templates</code>.  See <a href="#Template%20Instantiation">Template Instantiation</a>, for more
information.

<br><dt><code>-fno-rtti</code>
<dd>Disable generation of the information used by C++ runtime type
identification features (<code>dynamic_cast</code> and <code>typeid</code>).  If you
don't use those parts of the language (or exception handling, which uses
<code>dynamic_cast</code> internally), you can save some space by using this
flag.

<br><dt><code>-fstrict-prototype</code>
<dd>Within an <code>extern "C"</code> linkage specification, treat a function
declaration with no arguments, such as <code>int foo ();</code>, as declaring
the function to take no arguments.  Normally, such a declaration means
that the function <code>foo</code> can take any combination of arguments, as
in C.  <code>-pedantic</code> implies <code>-fstrict-prototype</code> unless
overridden with <code>-fno-strict-prototype</code>.

<p>Specifying this option will also suppress implicit declarations of
functions.

<p>This flag no longer affects declarations with C++ linkage.

<br><dt><code>-fsquangle</code>
<dt><code>-fno-squangle</code>
<dd><code>-fsquangle</code> will enable a compressed form of name mangling for
identifiers. In particular, it helps to shorten very long names by recognizing
types and class names which occur more than once, replacing them with special
short ID codes.  This option also requires any C++ libraries being used to
be compiled with this option as well.  The compiler has this disabled (the
equivalent of <code>-fno-squangle</code>) by default.

<p>Like all options that change the ABI, all C++ code, <em>including
libgcc.a</em> must be built with the same setting of this option.

<br><dt><code>-ftemplate-depth-<var>n</var></code>
<dd>Set the maximum instantiation depth for template classes to <var>n</var>. 
A limit on the template instantiation depth is needed to detect
endless recursions during template class instantiation. ANSI/ISO C++
conforming programs must not rely on a maximum depth greater than 17.

<br><dt><code>-fthis-is-variable</code>
<dd>Permit assignment to <code>this</code>.  The incorporation of user-defined
free store management into C++ has made assignment to <code>this</code> an
anachronism.  Therefore, by default it is invalid to assign to
<code>this</code> within a class member function; that is, GNU C++ treats
<code>this</code> in a member function of class <code>X</code> as a non-lvalue of
type <code>X *</code>.  However, for backwards compatibility, you can make it
valid with <code>-fthis-is-variable</code>.

<br><dt><code>-fvtable-thunks=<var>thunks-version</var></code>
<dd>Use <code>thunks</code> to implement the virtual function dispatch table
(<code>vtable</code>).  The traditional (cfront-style) approach to
implementing vtables was to store a pointer to the function and two
offsets for adjusting the <code>this</code> pointer at the call site.  Newer
implementations store a single pointer to a <code>thunk</code> function which
does any necessary adjustment and then calls the target function.

<p>The original implementation of thunks (version 1) had a bug regarding
virtual base classes; this bug is fixed with version 2 of the thunks
implementation. With setting the version to 2, compatibility to the
version 1 thunks is provided, at the cost of extra machine code. Version
3 does not include this compatibility.

<p>This option also enables a heuristic for controlling emission of
vtables; if a class has any non-inline virtual functions, the vtable
will be emitted in the translation unit containing the first one of
those.

<p>Like all options that change the ABI, all C++ code, <em>including
libgcc.a</em> must be built with the same setting of this option. Since
version 1 and version 2 are also incompatible (for classes with virtual
bases defining virtual functions), all code must also be compiled with
the same version.

<p>In this version of gcc, there are no targets for which version 2 thunks
are the default.  On all targets, not giving the option will use the
traditional implementation, and -fvtable-thunks will produce version 2
thunks.

<br><dt><code>-nostdinc++</code>
<dd>Do not search for header files in the standard directories specific to
C++, but do still search the other standard directories.  (This option
is used when building the C++ library.) 
</dl>

<p>In addition, these optimization, warning, and code generation options
have meanings only for C++ programs:

<dl>
<dt><code>-fno-default-inline</code>
<dd>Do not assume <code>inline</code> for functions defined inside a class scope. 
See <a href="#Optimize%20Options">Options That Control Optimization</a>.  Note that these
functions will have linkage like inline functions; they just won't be
inlined by default.

<br><dt><code>-Wctor-dtor-privacy (C++ only)</code>
<dd>Warn when a class seems unusable, because all the constructors or
destructors in a class are private and the class has no friends or
public static member functions.

<br><dt><code>-Wnon-virtual-dtor (C++ only)</code>
<dd>Warn when a class declares a non-virtual destructor that should probably
be virtual, because it looks like the class will be used polymorphically.

<br><dt><code>-Wreorder (C++ only)</code>
<dd>Warn when the order of member initializers given in the code does not
match the order in which they must be executed.  For instance:

<pre>struct A {
  int i;
  int j;
  A(): j (0), i (1) { }
};
</pre>

<p>Here the compiler will warn that the member initializers for <code>i</code>
and <code>j</code> will be rearranged to match the declaration order of the
members. 
</dl>

<p>The following <code>-W<small>...</small></code> options are not affected by <code>-Wall</code>.

<dl>
<dt><code>-Weffc++ (C++ only)</code>
<dd>Warn about violations of various style guidelines from Scott Meyers'
<cite>Effective C++</cite> books.  If you use this option, you should be aware
that the standard library headers do not obey all of these guidelines;
you can use <code>grep -v</code> to filter out those warnings.

<br><dt><code>-Wno-deprecated (C++ only)</code>
<dd>Do not warn about usage of deprecated features. See <a href="#Deprecated%20Features">Deprecated Features</a>.

<br><dt><code>-Wno-non-template-friend (C++ only)</code>
<dd>Disable warnings when non-templatized friend functions are declared
within a template. With the advent of explicit template specification
support in g++, if the name of the friend is an unqualified-id (ie,
<code>friend foo(int)</code>), the C++ language specification demands that the
friend declare or define an ordinary, nontemplate function. (Section
14.5.3). Before g++ implemented explicit specification, unqualified-ids
could be interpreted as a particular specialization of a templatized
function. Because this non-conforming behavior is no longer the default
behavior for g++, <code>-Wnon-template-friend</code> allows the compiler to
check existing code for potential trouble spots, and is on by default. 
This new compiler behavior can also be turned off with the flag
<code>-fguiding-decls</code>, which activates the older, non-specification
compiler code, or with <code>-Wno-non-template-friend</code> which keeps the
conformant compiler code but disables the helpful warning.

<br><dt><code>-Wold-style-cast (C++ only)</code>
<dd>Warn if an old-style (C-style) cast is used within a C++ program.  The
new-style casts (<code>static_cast</code>, <code>reinterpret_cast</code>, and
<code>const_cast</code>) are less vulnerable to unintended effects.

<br><dt><code>-Woverloaded-virtual (C++ only)</code>
<dd>Warn when a derived class function declaration may be an error in
defining a virtual function.  In a derived class, the
definitions of virtual functions must match the type signature of a
virtual function declared in the base class.  With this option, the
compiler warns when you define a function with the same name as a
virtual function, but with a type signature that does not match any
declarations from the base class.

<br><dt><code>-Wno-pmf-conversions (C++ only)</code>
<dd>Disable the diagnostic for converting a bound pointer to member function
to a plain pointer.

<br><dt><code>-Wsign-promo (C++ only)</code>
<dd>Warn when overload resolution chooses a promotion from unsigned or
enumeral type to a signed type over a conversion to an unsigned type of
the same size.  Previous versions of g++ would try to preserve
unsignedness, but the standard mandates the current behavior.

<br><dt><code>-Wsynth (C++ only)</code>
<dd>Warn when g++'s synthesis behavior does not match that of cfront.  For
instance:

<pre>struct A {
  operator int ();
  A&amp; operator = (int);
};

main ()
{
  A a,b;
  a = b;
}
</pre>

<p>In this example, g++ will synthesize a default <code>A&amp; operator =
(const A&amp;);</code>, while cfront will use the user-defined <code>operator =</code>.

<h2>Options to Request or Suppress Warnings</h2>

<p>Warnings are diagnostic messages that report constructions which
are not inherently erroneous but which are risky or suggest there
may have been an error.

<p>You can request many specific warnings with options beginning <code>-W</code>,
for example <code>-Wimplicit</code> to request warnings on implicit
declarations.  Each of these specific warning options also has a
negative form beginning <code>-Wno-</code> to turn off warnings;
for example, <code>-Wno-implicit</code>.  This manual lists only one of the
two forms, whichever is not the default.

<p>These options control the amount and kinds of warnings produced by GCC:

<dl>
<dt><code>-fsyntax-only</code>
<dd>Check the code for syntax errors, but don't do anything beyond that.

<br><dt><code>-pedantic</code>
<dd>Issue all the warnings demanded by strict ANSI C and ISO C++;
reject all programs that use forbidden extensions.

<p>Valid ANSI C and ISO C++ programs should compile properly with or without
this option (though a rare few will require <code>-ansi</code>).  However,
without this option, certain GNU extensions and traditional C and C++
features are supported as well.  With this option, they are rejected.

<p><code>-pedantic</code> does not cause warning messages for use of the
alternate keywords whose names begin and end with <code>__</code>.  Pedantic
warnings are also disabled in the expression that follows
<code>__extension__</code>.  However, only system header files should use
these escape routes; application programs should avoid them. 
See <a href="#Alternate%20Keywords">Alternate Keywords</a>.

<p>This option is not intended to be <i>useful</i>; it exists only to satisfy
pedants who would otherwise claim that GCC fails to support the ANSI
standard.

<p>Some users try to use <code>-pedantic</code> to check programs for strict ANSI
C conformance.  They soon find that it does not do quite what they want:
it finds some non-ANSI practices, but not all--only those for which
ANSI C <em>requires</em> a diagnostic.

<p>A feature to report any failure to conform to ANSI C might be useful in
some instances, but would require considerable additional work and would
be quite different from <code>-pedantic</code>.  We don't have plans to
support such a feature in the near future.

<br><dt><code>-pedantic-errors</code>
<dd>Like <code>-pedantic</code>, except that errors are produced rather than
warnings.

<br><dt><code>-w</code>
<dd>Inhibit all warning messages.

<br><dt><code>-Wno-import</code>
<dd>Inhibit warning messages about the use of <code>#import</code>.

<br><dt><code>-Wchar-subscripts</code>
<dd>Warn if an array subscript has type <code>char</code>.  This is a common cause
of error, as programmers often forget that this type is signed on some
machines.

<br><dt><code>-Wcomment</code>
<dd>Warn whenever a comment-start sequence <code>/*</code> appears in a <code>/*</code>
comment, or whenever a Backslash-Newline appears in a <code>//</code> comment.

<br><dt><code>-Wformat</code>
<dd>Check calls to <code>printf</code> and <code>scanf</code>, etc., to make sure that
the arguments supplied have types appropriate to the format string
specified.

<br><dt><code>-Wimplicit-int</code>
<dd>Warn when a declaration does not specify a type.

<br><dt><code>-Wimplicit-function-declaration</code>
<dt><code>-Werror-implicit-function-declaration</code>
<dd>Give a warning (or error) whenever a function is used before being
declared.

<br><dt><code>-Wimplicit</code>
<dd>Same as <code>-Wimplicit-int</code> and <code>-Wimplicit-function-</code><br>
<code>declaration</code>.

<br><dt><code>-Wmain</code>
<dd>Warn if the type of <code>main</code> is suspicious.  <code>main</code> should be a
function with external linkage, returning int, taking either zero
arguments, two, or three arguments of appropriate types.

<br><dt><code>-Wmultichar</code>
<dd>Warn if a multicharacter constant (<code>'FOOF'</code>) is used.  Usually they
indicate a typo in the user's code, as they have implementation-defined
values, and should not be used in portable code.

<br><dt><code>-Wparentheses</code>
<dd>Warn if parentheses are omitted in certain contexts, such
as when there is an assignment in a context where a truth value
is expected, or when operators are nested whose precedence people
often get confused about.

<p>Also warn about constructions where there may be confusion to which
<code>if</code> statement an <code>else</code> branch belongs.  Here is an example of
such a case:

<pre>{
  if (a)
    if (b)
      foo ();
  else
    bar ();
}
</pre>

<p>In C, every <code>else</code> branch belongs to the innermost possible <code>if</code>
statement, which in this example is <code>if (b)</code>.  This is often not
what the programmer expected, as illustrated in the above example by
indentation the programmer chose.  When there is the potential for this
confusion, GNU C will issue a warning when this flag is specified. 
To eliminate the warning, add explicit braces around the innermost
<code>if</code> statement so there is no way the <code>else</code> could belong to
the enclosing <code>if</code>.  The resulting code would look like this:

<pre>{
  if (a)
    {
      if (b)
        foo ();
      else
        bar ();
    }
}
</pre>

<br><dt><code>-Wreturn-type</code>
<dd>Warn whenever a function is defined with a return-type that defaults
to <code>int</code>.  Also warn about any <code>return</code> statement with no
return-value in a function whose return-type is not <code>void</code>.

<br><dt><code>-Wswitch</code>
<dd>Warn whenever a <code>switch</code> statement has an index of enumeral type
and lacks a <code>case</code> for one or more of the named codes of that
enumeration.  (The presence of a <code>default</code> label prevents this
warning.)  <code>case</code> labels outside the enumeration range also
provoke warnings when this option is used.

<br><dt><code>-Wtrigraphs</code>
<dd>Warn if any trigraphs are encountered (assuming they are enabled).

<br><dt><code>-Wunused</code>
<dd>Warn whenever a variable is unused aside from its declaration,
whenever a function is declared static but never defined, whenever a
label is declared but not used, and whenever a statement computes a
result that is explicitly not used.

<p>In order to get a warning about an unused function parameter, you must
specify both <code>-W</code> and <code>-Wunused</code>.

<p>To suppress this warning for an expression, simply cast it to void.  For
unused variables, parameters and labels, use the <code>unused</code> attribute
(see <a href="#Variable%20Attributes">Variable Attributes</a>).

<br><dt><code>-Wuninitialized</code>
<dd>An automatic variable is used without first being initialized.

<p>These warnings are possible only in optimizing compilation,
because they require data flow information that is computed only
when optimizing.  If you don't specify <code>-O</code>, you simply won't
get these warnings.

<p>These warnings occur only for variables that are candidates for
register allocation.  Therefore, they do not occur for a variable that
is declared <code>volatile</code>, or whose address is taken, or whose size
is other than 1, 2, 4 or 8 bytes.  Also, they do not occur for
structures, unions or arrays, even when they are in registers.

<p>Note that there may be no warning about a variable that is used only
to compute a value that itself is never used, because such
computations may be deleted by data flow analysis before the warnings
are printed.

<p>These warnings are made optional because GCC is not smart
enough to see all the reasons why the code might be correct
despite appearing to have an error.  Here is one example of how
this can happen:

<pre>{
  int x;
  switch (y)
    {
    case 1: x = 1;
      break;
    case 2: x = 4;
      break;
    case 3: x = 5;
    }
  foo (x);
}
</pre>

<p>If the value of <code>y</code> is always 1, 2 or 3, then <code>x</code> is
always initialized, but GCC doesn't know this.  Here is
another common case:

<pre>{
  int save_y;
  if (change_y) save_y = y, y = new_y;
  <small>...</small>
  if (change_y) y = save_y;
}
</pre>

<p>This has no bug because <code>save_y</code> is used only if it is set.

<p>Some spurious warnings can be avoided if you declare all the functions
you use that never return as <code>noreturn</code>.  See <a href="#Function%20Attributes">Function Attributes</a>.

<br><dt><code>-Wunknown-pragmas</code>
<dd>Warn when a #pragma directive is encountered which is not understood by
GCC.  If this command line option is used, warnings will even be issued
for unknown pragmas in system header files.  This is not the case if
the warnings were only enabled by the <code>-Wall</code> command line option.

<br><dt><code>-Wall</code>
<dd>All of the above <code>-W</code> options combined.  This enables all the
warnings about constructions that some users consider questionable, and
that are easy to avoid (or modify to prevent the warning), even in
conjunction with macros. 
</dl>

<p>The following <code>-W<small>...</small></code> options are not implied by <code>-Wall</code>. 
Some of them warn about constructions that users generally do not
consider questionable, but which occasionally you might wish to check
for; others warn about constructions that are necessary or hard to avoid
in some cases, and there is no simple way to modify the code to suppress
the warning.

<dl>
<dt><code>-W</code>
<dd>Print extra warning messages for these events:

<ul>
<li>A nonvolatile automatic variable might be changed by a call to
<code>longjmp</code>.  These warnings as well are possible only in
optimizing compilation.

<p>The compiler sees only the calls to <code>setjmp</code>.  It cannot know
where <code>longjmp</code> will be called; in fact, a signal handler could
call it at any point in the code.  As a result, you may get a warning
even when there is in fact no problem because <code>longjmp</code> cannot
in fact be called at the place which would cause a problem.

</p><li>A function can return either with or without a value.  (Falling
off the end of the function body is considered returning without
a value.)  For example, this function would evoke such a
warning:

<pre>foo (a)
{
  if (a &gt; 0)
    return a;
}
</pre>

<li>An expression-statement or the left-hand side of a comma expression
contains no side effects. 
To suppress the warning, cast the unused expression to void. 
For example, an expression such as <code>x[i,j]</code> will cause a warning,
but <code>x[(void)i,j]</code> will not.

<li>An unsigned value is compared against zero with <code>&lt;</code> or <code>&lt;=</code>.

<li>A comparison like <code>x&lt;=y&lt;=z</code> appears; this is equivalent to
<code>(x&lt;=y ? 1 : 0) &lt;= z</code>, which is a different interpretation from
that of ordinary mathematical notation.

<li>Storage-class specifiers like <code>static</code> are not the first things in
a declaration.  According to the C Standard, this usage is obsolescent.

<li>If <code>-Wall</code> or <code>-Wunused</code> is also specified, warn about unused
arguments.

<li>A comparison between signed and unsigned values could produce an
incorrect result when the signed value is converted to unsigned. 
(But don't warn if <code>-Wno-sign-compare</code> is also specified.)

<li>An aggregate has a partly bracketed initializer. 
For example, the following code would evoke such a warning,
because braces are missing around the initializer for <code>x.h</code>:

<pre>struct s { int f, g; };
struct t { struct s h; int i; };
struct t x = { 1, 2, 3 };
</pre>

<li>An aggregate has an initializer which does not initialize all members. 
For example, the following code would cause such a warning, because
<code>x.h</code> would be implicitly initialized to zero:

<pre>struct s { int f, g, h; };
struct s x = { 3, 4 };
</pre>
</ul>

<br><dt><code>-Wtraditional</code>
<dd>Warn about certain constructs that behave differently in traditional and
ANSI C.

<ul>
<li>Macro arguments occurring within string constants in the macro body. 
These would substitute the argument in traditional C, but are part of
the constant in ANSI C.

<li>A function declared external in one block and then used after the end of
the block.

<li>A <code>switch</code> statement has an operand of type <code>long</code>.

<li>A non-<code>static</code> function declaration follows a <code>static</code> one. 
This construct is not accepted by some traditional C compilers. 
</ul>

<br><dt><code>-Wundef</code>
<dd>Warn if an undefined identifier is evaluated in an <code>#if</code> directive.

<br><dt><code>-Wshadow</code>
<dd>Warn whenever a local variable shadows another local variable.

<br><dt><code>-Wid-clash-<var>len</var></code>
<dd>Warn whenever two distinct identifiers match in the first <var>len</var>
characters.  This may help you prepare a program that will compile
with certain obsolete, brain-damaged compilers.

<br><dt><code>-Wlarger-than-<var>len</var></code>
<dd>Warn whenever an object of larger than <var>len</var> bytes is defined.

<br><dt><code>-Wpointer-arith</code>
<dd>Warn about anything that depends on the "size of" a function type or
of <code>void</code>.  GNU C assigns these types a size of 1, for
convenience in calculations with <code>void *</code> pointers and pointers
to functions.

<br><dt><code>-Wbad-function-cast</code>
<dd>Warn whenever a function call is cast to a non-matching type. 
For example, warn if <code>int malloc()</code> is cast to <code>anything *</code>.

<br><dt><code>-Wcast-qual</code>
<dd>Warn whenever a pointer is cast so as to remove a type qualifier from
the target type.  For example, warn if a <code>const char *</code> is cast
to an ordinary <code>char *</code>.

<br><dt><code>-Wcast-align</code>
<dd>Warn whenever a pointer is cast such that the required alignment of the
target is increased.  For example, warn if a <code>char *</code> is cast to
an <code>int *</code> on machines where integers can only be accessed at
two- or four-byte boundaries.

<br><dt><code>-Wwrite-strings</code>
<dd>Give string constants the type <code>const char[<var>length</var>]</code> so that
copying the address of one into a non-<code>const</code> <code>char *</code>
pointer will get a warning.  These warnings will help you find at
compile time code that can try to write into a string constant, but
only if you have been very careful about using <code>const</code> in
declarations and prototypes.  Otherwise, it will just be a nuisance;
this is why we did not make <code>-Wall</code> request these warnings.

<br><dt><code>-Wconversion</code>
<dd>Warn if a prototype causes a type conversion that is different from what
would happen to the same argument in the absence of a prototype.  This
includes conversions of fixed point to floating and vice versa, and
conversions changing the width or signedness of a fixed point argument
except when the same as the default promotion.

<p>Also, warn if a negative integer constant expression is implicitly
converted to an unsigned type.  For example, warn about the assignment
<code>x = -1</code> if <code>x</code> is unsigned.  But do not warn about explicit
casts like <code>(unsigned) -1</code>.

<br><dt><code>-Wsign-compare</code>
<dd>Warn when a comparison between signed and unsigned values could produce
an incorrect result when the signed value is converted to unsigned. 
This warning is also enabled by <code>-W</code>; to get the other warnings
of <code>-W</code> without this warning, use <code>-W -Wno-sign-compare</code>.

<br><dt><code>-Waggregate-return</code>
<dd>Warn if any functions that return structures or unions are defined or
called.  (In languages where you can return an array, this also elicits
a warning.)

<br><dt><code>-Wstrict-prototypes</code>
<dd>Warn if a function is declared or defined without specifying the
argument types.  (An old-style function definition is permitted without
a warning if preceded by a declaration which specifies the argument
types.)

<br><dt><code>-Wmissing-prototypes</code>
<dd>Warn if a global function is defined without a previous prototype
declaration.  This warning is issued even if the definition itself
provides a prototype.  The aim is to detect global functions that fail
to be declared in header files.

<br><dt><code>-Wmissing-declarations</code>
<dd>Warn if a global function is defined without a previous declaration. 
Do so even if the definition itself provides a prototype. 
Use this option to detect global functions that are not declared in
header files.

<br><dt><code>-Wmissing-noreturn</code>
<dd>Warn about functions which might be candidates for attribute <code>noreturn</code>. 
Note these are only possible candidates, not absolute ones.  Care should
be taken to manually verify functions actually do not ever return before
adding the <code>noreturn</code> attribute, otherwise subtle code generation
bugs could be introduced.

<br><dt><code>-Wredundant-decls</code>
<dd>Warn if anything is declared more than once in the same scope, even in
cases where multiple declaration is valid and changes nothing.

<br><dt><code>-Wnested-externs</code>
<dd>Warn if an <code>extern</code> declaration is encountered within an function.

<br><dt><code>-Winline</code>
<dd>Warn if a function can not be inlined, and either it was declared as inline,
or else the <code>-finline-functions</code> option was given.

<br><dt><code>-Wlong-long</code>
<dd>Warn if <code>long long</code> type is used.  This is default.  To inhibit
the warning messages, use <code>-Wno-long-long</code>.  Flags
<code>-Wlong-long</code> and <code>-Wno-long-long</code> are taken into account
only when <code>-pedantic</code> flag is used.

<br><dt><code>-Werror</code>
<dd>Make all warnings into errors.

<h2>Options for Debugging Your Program or GCC</h2>

<p>GCC has various special options that are used for debugging
either your program or GCC:

<dl>
<dt><code>-g</code>
<dd>Produce debugging information in the operating system's native format
(stabs, COFF, XCOFF, or DWARF).  GDB can work with this debugging
information.

<p>On most systems that use stabs format, <code>-g</code> enables use of extra
debugging information that only GDB can use; this extra information
makes debugging work better in GDB but will probably make other debuggers
crash or
refuse to read the program.  If you want to control for certain whether
to generate the extra information, use <code>-gstabs+</code>, <code>-gstabs</code>,
<code>-gxcoff+</code>, <code>-gxcoff</code>, <code>-gdwarf-1+</code>, or <code>-gdwarf-1</code>
(see below).

<p>Unlike most other C compilers, GCC allows you to use <code>-g</code> with
<code>-O</code>.  The shortcuts taken by optimized code may occasionally
produce surprising results: some variables you declared may not exist
at all; flow of control may briefly move where you did not expect it;
some statements may not be executed because they compute constant
results or their values were already at hand; some statements may
execute in different places because they were moved out of loops.

<p>Nevertheless it proves possible to debug optimized output.  This makes
it reasonable to use the optimizer for programs that might have bugs.

<p>The following options are useful when GCC is generated with the
capability for more than one debugging format.

<br><dt><code>-ggdb</code>
<dd>Produce debugging information for use by GDB.  This means to use the
most expressive format available (DWARF 2, stabs, or the native format
if neither of those are supported), including GDB extensions if at all
possible.

<br><dt><code>-gstabs</code>
<dd>Produce debugging information in stabs format (if that is supported),
without GDB extensions.  This is the format used by DBX on most BSD
systems.  On MIPS, Alpha and System V Release 4 systems this option
produces stabs debugging output which is not understood by DBX or SDB. 
On System V Release 4 systems this option requires the GNU assembler.

<br><dt><code>-gstabs+</code>
<dd>Produce debugging information in stabs format (if that is supported),
using GNU extensions understood only by the GNU debugger (GDB).  The
use of these extensions is likely to make other debuggers crash or
refuse to read the program.

<br><dt><code>-gcoff</code>
<dd>Produce debugging information in COFF format (if that is supported). 
This is the format used by SDB on most System V systems prior to
System V Release 4.

<br><dt><code>-gxcoff</code>
<dd>Produce debugging information in XCOFF format (if that is supported). 
This is the format used by the DBX debugger on IBM RS/6000 systems.

<br><dt><code>-gxcoff+</code>
<dd>Produce debugging information in XCOFF format (if that is supported),
using GNU extensions understood only by the GNU debugger (GDB).  The
use of these extensions is likely to make other debuggers crash or
refuse to read the program, and may cause assemblers other than the GNU
assembler (GAS) to fail with an error.

<br><dt><code>-gdwarf</code>
<dd>Produce debugging information in DWARF version 1 format (if that is
supported).  This is the format used by SDB on most System V Release 4
systems.

<br><dt><code>-gdwarf+</code>
<dd>Produce debugging information in DWARF version 1 format (if that is
supported), using GNU extensions understood only by the GNU debugger
(GDB).  The use of these extensions is likely to make other debuggers
crash or refuse to read the program.

<br><dt><code>-gdwarf-2</code>
<dd>Produce debugging information in DWARF version 2 format (if that is
supported).  This is the format used by DBX on IRIX 6.

<br><dt><code>-g<var>level</var></code>
<dt><code>-ggdb<var>level</var></code>
<dt><code>-gstabs<var>level</var></code>
<dt><code>-gcoff<var>level</var></code>
<dt><code>-gxcoff<var>level</var></code>
<dt><code>-gdwarf<var>level</var></code>
<dt><code>-gdwarf-2<var>level</var></code>
<dd>Request debugging information and also use <var>level</var> to specify how
much information.  The default level is 2.

<p>Level 1 produces minimal information, enough for making backtraces in
parts of the program that you don't plan to debug.  This includes
descriptions of functions and external variables, but no information
about local variables and no line numbers.

<p>Level 3 includes extra information, such as all the macro definitions
present in the program.  Some debuggers support macro expansion when
you use <code>-g3</code>.

<br><dt><code>-p</code>
<dd>Generate extra code to write profile information suitable for the
analysis program <code>prof</code>.  You must use this option when compiling
the source files you want data about, and you must also use it when
linking.

<br><dt><code>-pg</code>
<dd>Generate extra code to write profile information suitable for the
analysis program <code>gprof</code>.  You must use this option when compiling
the source files you want data about, and you must also use it when
linking.

<br><dt><code>-a</code>
<dd>Generate extra code to write profile information for basic blocks, which will
record the number of times each basic block is executed, the basic block start
address, and the function name containing the basic block.  If <code>-g</code> is
used, the line number and filename of the start of the basic block will also be
recorded.  If not overridden by the machine description, the default action is
to append to the text file <code>bb.out</code>.

<p>This data could be analyzed by a program like <code>tcov</code>.  Note,
however, that the format of the data is not what <code>tcov</code> expects. 
Eventually GNU <code>gprof</code> should be extended to process this data.

<br><dt><code>-Q</code>
<dd>Makes the compiler print out each function name as it is compiled, and
print some statistics about each pass when it finishes.

<br><dt><code>-ax</code>
<dd>Generate extra code to profile basic blocks.  Your executable will
produce output that is a superset of that produced when <code>-a</code> is
used.  Additional output is the source and target address of the basic
blocks where a jump takes place, the number of times a jump is executed,
and (optionally) the complete sequence of basic blocks being executed. 
The output is appended to file <code>bb.out</code>.

<p>You can examine different profiling aspects without recompilation.  Your
executable will read a list of function names from file <code>bb.in</code>. 
Profiling starts when a function on the list is entered and stops when
that invocation is exited.  To exclude a function from profiling, prefix
its name with `-'.  If a function name is not unique, you can
disambiguate it by writing it in the form
<code>/path/filename.d:functionname</code>.  Your executable will write the
available paths and filenames in file <code>bb.out</code>.

<p>Several function names have a special meaning:
<dl>
<dt><code>__bb_jumps__</code>
<dd>Write source, target and frequency of jumps to file <code>bb.out</code>. 
<br><dt><code>__bb_hidecall__</code>
<dd>Exclude function calls from frequency count. 
<br><dt><code>__bb_showret__</code>
<dd>Include function returns in frequency count. 
<br><dt><code>__bb_trace__</code>
<dd>Write the sequence of basic blocks executed to file <code>bbtrace.gz</code>. 
The file will be compressed using the program <code>gzip</code>, which must
exist in your <code>PATH</code>.  On systems without the <code>popen</code>
function, the file will be named <code>bbtrace</code> and will not be
compressed.  <strong>Profiling for even a few seconds on these systems
will produce a very large file.</strong>  Note: <code>__bb_hidecall__</code> and
<code>__bb_showret__</code> will not affect the sequence written to
<code>bbtrace.gz</code>. 
</dl>

<p>Here's a short example using different profiling parameters
in file <code>bb.in</code>.  Assume function <code>foo</code> consists of basic blocks
1 and 2 and is called twice from block 3 of function <code>main</code>.  After
the calls, block 3 transfers control to block 4 of <code>main</code>.

<p>With <code>__bb_trace__</code> and <code>main</code> contained in file <code>bb.in</code>,
the following sequence of blocks is written to file <code>bbtrace.gz</code>:
0 3 1 2 1 2 4.  The return from block 2 to block 3 is not shown, because
the return is to a point inside the block and not to the top.  The
block address 0 always indicates, that control is transferred
to the trace from somewhere outside the observed functions.  With
<code>-foo</code> added to <code>bb.in</code>, the blocks of function
<code>foo</code> are removed from the trace, so only 0 3 4 remains.

<p>With <code>__bb_jumps__</code> and <code>main</code> contained in file <code>bb.in</code>,
jump frequencies will be written to file <code>bb.out</code>.  The
frequencies are obtained by constructing a trace of blocks
and incrementing a counter for every neighbouring pair of blocks
in the trace.  The trace 0 3 1 2 1 2 4 displays the following
frequencies:

<pre>Jump from block 0x0 to block 0x3 executed 1 time(s)
Jump from block 0x3 to block 0x1 executed 1 time(s)
Jump from block 0x1 to block 0x2 executed 2 time(s)
Jump from block 0x2 to block 0x1 executed 1 time(s)
Jump from block 0x2 to block 0x4 executed 1 time(s)
</pre>

<p>With <code>__bb_hidecall__</code>, control transfer due to call instructions
is removed from the trace, that is the trace is cut into three parts: 0
3 4, 0 1 2 and 0 1 2.  With <code>__bb_showret__</code>, control transfer due
to return instructions is added to the trace.  The trace becomes: 0 3 1
2 3 1 2 3 4.  Note, that this trace is not the same, as the sequence
written to <code>bbtrace.gz</code>.  It is solely used for counting jump
frequencies.

<br><dt><code>-fprofile-arcs</code>
<dd>Instrument <dfn>arcs</dfn> during compilation.  For each function of your
program, GCC creates a program flow graph, then finds a spanning tree
for the graph.  Only arcs that are not on the spanning tree have to be
instrumented: the compiler adds code to count the number of times that these
arcs are executed.  When an arc is the only exit or only entrance to a
block, the instrumentation code can be added to the block; otherwise, a
new basic block must be created to hold the instrumentation code.

<p>Since not every arc in the program must be instrumented, programs
compiled with this option run faster than programs compiled with
<code>-a</code>, which adds instrumentation code to every basic block in the
program.  The tradeoff: since <code>gcov</code> does not have
execution counts for all branches, it must start with the execution
counts for the instrumented branches, and then iterate over the program
flow graph until the entire graph has been solved.  Hence, <code>gcov</code>
runs a little more slowly than a program which uses information from
<code>-a</code>.

<p><code>-fprofile-arcs</code> also makes it possible to estimate branch
probabilities, and to calculate basic block execution counts.  In
general, basic block execution counts do not give enough information to
estimate all branch probabilities.  When the compiled program exits, it
saves the arc execution counts to a file called
<code><var>sourcename</var>.da</code>.  Use the compiler option
<code>-fbranch-probabilities</code> (see <a href="#Optimize%20Options">Options that Control Optimization</a>) when recompiling, to optimize using estimated
branch probabilities.

<br><dt><code>-ftest-coverage</code>
<dd>Create data files for the <code>gcov</code> code-coverage utility
(see <a href="#Gcov"><code>gcov</code>: a GCC Test Coverage Program</a>). 
The data file names begin with the name of your source file:

<dl>
<dt><code><var>sourcename</var>.bb</code>
<dd>A mapping from basic blocks to line numbers, which <code>gcov</code> uses to
associate basic block execution counts with line numbers.

<br><dt><code><var>sourcename</var>.bbg</code>
<dd>A list of all arcs in the program flow graph.  This allows <code>gcov</code>
to reconstruct the program flow graph, so that it can compute all basic
block and arc execution counts from the information in the
<code><var>sourcename</var>.da</code> file (this last file is the output from
<code>-fprofile-arcs</code>). 
</dl>

<br><dt><code>-Q</code>
<dd>Makes the compiler print out each function name as it is compiled, and
print some statistics about each pass when it finishes.

<br><dt><code>-d<var>letters</var></code>
<dd>Says to make debugging dumps during compilation at times specified by
<var>letters</var>.  This is used for debugging the compiler.  The file names
for most of the dumps are made by appending a word to the source file
name (e.g.  <code>foo.c.rtl</code> or <code>foo.c.jump</code>).  Here are the
possible letters for use in <var>letters</var>, and their meanings:

<dl>
<dt><code>b</code>
<dd>Dump after computing branch probabilities, to <code><var>file</var>.bp</code>. 
<br><dt><code>c</code>
<dd>Dump after instruction combination, to the file <code><var>file</var>.combine</code>. 
<br><dt><code>d</code>
<dd>Dump after delayed branch scheduling, to <code><var>file</var>.dbr</code>. 
<br><dt><code>D</code>
<dd>Dump all macro definitions, at the end of preprocessing, in addition to
normal output. 
<br><dt><code>r</code>
<dd>Dump after RTL generation, to <code><var>file</var>.rtl</code>. 
<br><dt><code>j</code>
<dd>Dump after first jump optimization, to <code><var>file</var>.jump</code>. 
<br><dt><code>F</code>
<dd>Dump after purging ADDRESSOF, to <code><var>file</var>.addressof</code>. 
<br><dt><code>f</code>
<dd>Dump after flow analysis, to <code><var>file</var>.flow</code>. 
<br><dt><code>g</code>
<dd>Dump after global register allocation, to <code><var>file</var>.greg</code>. 
<br><dt><code>G</code>
<dd>Dump after GCSE, to <code><var>file</var>.gcse</code>. 
<br><dt><code>j</code>
<dd>Dump after first jump optimization, to <code><var>file</var>.jump</code>. 
<br><dt><code>J</code>
<dd>Dump after last jump optimization, to <code><var>file</var>.jump2</code>. 
<br><dt><code>k</code>
<dd>Dump after conversion from registers to stack, to <code><var>file</var>.stack</code>. 
<br><dt><code>l</code>
<dd>Dump after local register allocation, to <code><var>file</var>.lreg</code>. 
<br><dt><code>L</code>
<dd>Dump after loop optimization, to <code><var>file</var>.loop</code>. 
<br><dt><code>M</code>
<dd>Dump after performing the machine dependent reorganisation pass, to
<code><var>file</var>.mach</code>. 
<br><dt><code>N</code>
<dd>Dump after the register move pass, to <code><var>file</var>.regmove</code>. 
<br><dt><code>r</code>
<dd>Dump after RTL generation, to <code><var>file</var>.rtl</code>. 
<br><dt><code>R</code>
<dd>Dump after the second instruction scheduling pass, to <code><var>file</var>.sched2</code>. 
<br><dt><code>s</code>
<dd>Dump after CSE (including the jump optimization that sometimes follows
CSE), to <code><var>file</var>.cse</code>. 
<br><dt><code>S</code>
<dd>Dump after the first instruction scheduling pass, to <code><var>file</var>.sched</code>. 
<br><dt><code>t</code>
<dd>Dump after the second CSE pass (including the jump optimization that
sometimes follows CSE), to <code><var>file</var>.cse2</code>. 
<br><dt><code>a</code>
<dd>Produce all the dumps listed above. 
<br><dt><code>m</code>
<dd>Print statistics on memory usage, at the end of the run, to
standard error. 
<br><dt><code>p</code>
<dd>Annotate the assembler output with a comment indicating which
pattern and alternative was used.  The length of each instruction is
also printed. 
<br><dt><code>x</code>
<dd>Just generate RTL for a function instead of compiling it.  Usually used
with <code>r</code>. 
<br><dt><code>y</code>
<dd>Dump debugging information during parsing, to standard error. 
<br><dt><code>A</code>
<dd>Annotate the assembler output with miscellaneous debugging information. 
</dl>

<br><dt><code>-fdump-unnumbered</code>
<dd>When doing debugging dumps (see -d option above), suppress instruction
numbers and line number note output.  This makes it more feasible to
use diff on debugging dumps for compiler invokations with different
options, in particular with and without -g.

<br><dt><code>-fpretend-float</code>
<dd>When running a cross-compiler, pretend that the target machine uses the
same floating point format as the host machine.  This causes incorrect
output of the actual floating constants, but the actual instruction
sequence will probably be the same as GCC would make when running on
the target machine.

<br><dt><code>-save-temps</code>
<dd>Store the usual "temporary" intermediate files permanently; place them
in the current directory and name them based on the source file.  Thus,
compiling <code>foo.c</code> with <code>-c -save-temps</code> would produce files
<code>foo.i</code> and <code>foo.s</code>, as well as <code>foo.o</code>.

<br><dt><code>-print-file-name=<var>library</var></code>
<dd>Print the full absolute name of the library file <var>library</var> that
would be used when linking--and don't do anything else.  With this
option, GCC does not compile or link anything; it just prints the
file name.

<br><dt><code>-print-prog-name=<var>program</var></code>
<dd>Like <code>-print-file-name</code>, but searches for a program such as <code>cpp</code>.

<br><dt><code>-print-libgcc-file-name</code>
<dd>Same as <code>-print-file-name=libgcc.a</code>.

<p>This is useful when you use <code>-nostdlib</code> or <code>-nodefaultlibs</code>
but you do want to link with <code>libgcc.a</code>.  You can do

<pre>gcc -nostdlib <var>files</var><small>...</small> `gcc -print-libgcc-file-name`
</pre>

<br><dt><code>-print-search-dirs</code>
<dd>Print the name of the configured installation directory and a list of
program and library directories gcc will search--and don't do anything else.

<p>This is useful when gcc prints the error message
<code>installation problem, cannot exec cpp: No such file or directory</code>. 
To resolve this you either need to put <code>cpp</code> and the other compiler
components where gcc expects to find them, or you can set the environment
variable <code>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</code> to the directory where you installed them. 
Don't forget the trailing '/'.

<h2>Options That Control Optimization</h2>

<p>These options control various sorts of optimizations:

<dl>
<dt><code>-O</code>
<dt><code>-O1</code>
<dd>Optimize.  Optimizing compilation takes somewhat more time, and a lot
more memory for a large function.

<p>Without <code>-O</code>, the compiler's goal is to reduce the cost of
compilation and to make debugging produce the expected results. 
Statements are independent: if you stop the program with a breakpoint
between statements, you can then assign a new value to any variable or
change the program counter to any other statement in the function and
get exactly the results you would expect from the source code.

<p>Without <code>-O</code>, the compiler only allocates variables declared
<code>register</code> in registers.  The resulting compiled code is a little
worse than produced by PCC without <code>-O</code>.

<p>With <code>-O</code>, the compiler tries to reduce code size and execution
time.

<p>When you specify <code>-O</code>, the compiler turns on <code>-fthread-jumps</code>
and <code>-fdefer-pop</code> on all machines.  The compiler turns on
<code>-fdelayed-branch</code> on machines that have delay slots, and
<code>-fomit-frame-pointer</code> on machines that can support debugging even
without a frame pointer.  On some machines the compiler also turns
on other flags.

<br><dt><code>-O2</code>
<dd>Optimize even more.  GCC performs nearly all supported optimizations
that do not involve a space-speed tradeoff.  The compiler does not
perform loop unrolling or function inlining when you specify <code>-O2</code>. 
As compared to <code>-O</code>, this option increases both compilation time
and the performance of the generated code.

<p><code>-O2</code> turns on all optional optimizations except for loop unrolling,
function inlining, and strict aliasing optimizations.  It also turns on the
<code>-fforce-mem</code> option on all machines and frame pointer elimination on
machines where doing so does not interfere with debugging.

<br><dt><code>-O3</code>
<dd>Optimize yet more.  <code>-O3</code> turns on all optimizations specified by
<code>-O2</code> and also turns on the <code>inline-functions</code> option.

<br><dt><code>-O0</code>
<dd>Do not optimize.

<br><dt><code>-Os</code>
<dd>Optimize for size.  <code>-Os</code> enables all <code>-O2</code> optimizations that
do not typically increase code size.  It also performs further
optimizations designed to reduce code size.

<p>If you use multiple <code>-O</code> options, with or without level numbers,
the last such option is the one that is effective. 
</dl>

<p>Options of the form <code>-f<var>flag</var></code> specify machine-independent
flags.  Most flags have both positive and negative forms; the negative
form of <code>-ffoo</code> would be <code>-fno-foo</code>.  In the table below,
only one of the forms is listed--the one which is not the default. 
You can figure out the other form by either removing <code>no-</code> or
adding it.

<dl>
<dt><code>-ffloat-store</code>
<dd>Do not store floating point variables in registers, and inhibit other
options that might change whether a floating point value is taken from a
register or memory.

<p>This option prevents undesirable excess precision on machines such as
the 68000 where the floating registers (of the 68881) keep more
precision than a <code>double</code> is supposed to have.  Similarly for the
x86 architecture.  For most programs, the excess precision does only
good, but a few programs rely on the precise definition of IEEE floating
point.  Use <code>-ffloat-store</code> for such programs, after modifying
them to store all pertinent intermediate computations into variables.

<br><dt><code>-fno-default-inline</code>
<dd>Do not make member functions inline by default merely because they are
defined inside the class scope (C++ only).  Otherwise, when you specify
<code>-O</code>, member functions defined inside class scope are compiled
inline by default; i.e., you don't need to add <code>inline</code> in front of
the member function name.

<br><dt><code>-fno-defer-pop</code>
<dd>Always pop the arguments to each function call as soon as that function
returns.  For machines which must pop arguments after a function call,
the compiler normally lets arguments accumulate on the stack for several
function calls and pops them all at once.

<br><dt><code>-fforce-mem</code>
<dd>Force memory operands to be copied into registers before doing
arithmetic on them.  This produces better code by making all memory
references potential common subexpressions.  When they are not common
subexpressions, instruction combination should eliminate the separate
register-load.  The <code>-O2</code> option turns on this option.

<br><dt><code>-fforce-addr</code>
<dd>Force memory address constants to be copied into registers before
doing arithmetic on them.  This may produce better code just as
<code>-fforce-mem</code> may.

<br><dt><code>-fomit-frame-pointer</code>
<dd>Don't keep the frame pointer in a register for functions that
don't need one.  This avoids the instructions to save, set up and
restore frame pointers; it also makes an extra register available
in many functions.  <strong>It also makes debugging impossible on
some machines.</strong>

<p>On some machines, such as the Vax, this flag has no effect, because
the standard calling sequence automatically handles the frame pointer
and nothing is saved by pretending it doesn't exist.  The
machine-description macro <code>FRAME_POINTER_REQUIRED</code> controls
whether a target machine supports this flag.  See <a href="#Registers">Registers</a>.

<br><dt><code>-fno-inline</code>
<dd>Don't pay attention to the <code>inline</code> keyword.  Normally this option
is used to keep the compiler from expanding any functions inline. 
Note that if you are not optimizing, no functions can be expanded inline.

<br><dt><code>-finline-functions</code>
<dd>Integrate all simple functions into their callers.  The compiler
heuristically decides which functions are simple enough to be worth
integrating in this way.

<p>If all calls to a given function are integrated, and the function is
declared <code>static</code>, then the function is normally not output as
assembler code in its own right.

<br><dt><code>-finline-limit-<var>n</var></code>
<dd>By default, gcc limits the size of functions that can be inlined.  This flag
allows the control of this limit for functions that are explicitly marked as
inline (ie marked with the inline keyword or defined within the class
definition in c++).  <var>n</var> is the size of functions that can be inlined in
number of pseudo instructions (not counting parameter handling).  The default
value of n is 10000.  Increasing this value can result in more inlined code at
the cost of compilation time and memory consumption.  Decreasing usually makes
the compilation faster and less code will be inlined (which presumably
means slower programs).  This option is particularly useful for programs that
use inlining heavily such as those based on recursive templates with c++.

<p><em>Note:</em> pseudo instruction represents, in this particular context, an
abstract measurement of function's size.  In no way, it represents a count
of assembly instructions and as such its exact meaning might change from one
release to an another.

<br><dt><code>-fkeep-inline-functions</code>
<dd>Even if all calls to a given function are integrated, and the function
is declared <code>static</code>, nevertheless output a separate run-time
callable version of the function.  This switch does not affect
<code>extern inline</code> functions.

<br><dt><code>-fkeep-static-consts</code>
<dd>Emit variables declared <code>static const</code> when optimization isn't turned
on, even if the variables aren't referenced.

<p>GCC enables this option by default.  If you want to force the compiler to
check if the variable was referenced, regardless of whether or not
optimization is turned on, use the <code>-fno-keep-static-consts</code> option.

<br><dt><code>-fno-function-cse</code>
<dd>Do not put function addresses in registers; make each instruction that
calls a constant function contain the function's address explicitly.

<p>This option results in less efficient code, but some strange hacks
that alter the assembler output may be confused by the optimizations
performed when this option is not used.

<br><dt><code>-ffast-math</code>
<dd>This option allows GCC to violate some ANSI or IEEE rules and/or
specifications in the interest of optimizing code for speed.  For
example, it allows the compiler to assume arguments to the <code>sqrt</code>
function are non-negative numbers and that no floating-point values
are NaNs.

<p>This option should never be turned on by any <code>-O</code> option since
it can result in incorrect output for programs which depend on
an exact implementation of IEEE or ANSI rules/specifications for
math functions. 
</dl>

<p>The following options control specific optimizations.  The <code>-O2</code>
option turns on all of these optimizations except <code>-funroll-loops</code>
<code>-funroll-all-loops</code>, and <code>-fstrict-aliasing</code>.  On most machines, the
<code>-O</code> option turns on the <code>-fthread-jumps</code> and <code>-fdelayed-branch</code>
options, but specific machines may handle it differently.

<p>You can use the following flags in the rare cases when "fine-tuning"
of optimizations to be performed is desired.

<dl>
<dt><code>-fstrength-reduce</code>
<dd>Perform the optimizations of loop strength reduction and
elimination of iteration variables.

<br><dt><code>-fthread-jumps</code>
<dd>Perform optimizations where we check to see if a jump branches to a
location where another comparison subsumed by the first is found.  If
so, the first branch is redirected to either the destination of the
second branch or a point immediately following it, depending on whether
the condition is known to be true or false.

<br><dt><code>-fcse-follow-jumps</code>
<dd>In common subexpression elimination, scan through jump instructions
when the target of the jump is not reached by any other path.  For
example, when CSE encounters an <code>if</code> statement with an
<code>else</code> clause, CSE will follow the jump when the condition
tested is false.

<br><dt><code>-fcse-skip-blocks</code>
<dd>This is similar to <code>-fcse-follow-jumps</code>, but causes CSE to
follow jumps which conditionally skip over blocks.  When CSE
encounters a simple <code>if</code> statement with no else clause,
<code>-fcse-skip-blocks</code> causes CSE to follow the jump around the
body of the <code>if</code>.

<br><dt><code>-frerun-cse-after-loop</code>
<dd>Re-run common subexpression elimination after loop optimizations has been
performed.

<br><dt><code>-frerun-loop-opt</code>
<dd>Run the loop optimizer twice.

<br><dt><code>-fgcse</code>
<dd>Perform a global common subexpression elimination pass. 
This pass also performs global constant and copy propagation.

<br><dt><code>-fexpensive-optimizations</code>
<dd>Perform a number of minor optimizations that are relatively expensive.

<br><dt><code>-foptimize-register-moves</code>
<dt><code>-fregmove</code>
<dd>Attempt to reassign register numbers in move instructions and as
operands of other simple instructions in order to maximize the amount of
register tying.  This is especially helpful on machines with two-operand
instructions.  GCC enables this optimization by default with <code>-O2</code>
or higher.

<p>Note <code>-fregmove</code> and <code>-foptimize-register-moves</code> are the same
optimization.

<br><dt><code>-fdelayed-branch</code>
<dd>If supported for the target machine, attempt to reorder instructions
to exploit instruction slots available after delayed branch
instructions.

<br><dt><code>-fschedule-insns</code>
<dd>If supported for the target machine, attempt to reorder instructions to
eliminate execution stalls due to required data being unavailable.  This
helps machines that have slow floating point or memory load instructions
by allowing other instructions to be issued until the result of the load
or floating point instruction is required.

<br><dt><code>-fschedule-insns2</code>
<dd>Similar to <code>-fschedule-insns</code>, but requests an additional pass of
instruction scheduling after register allocation has been done.  This is
especially useful on machines with a relatively small number of
registers and where memory load instructions take more than one cycle.

<br><dt><code>-ffunction-sections</code>
<dt><code>-fdata-sections</code>
<dd>Place each function or data item into its own section in the output
file if the target supports arbitrary sections.  The name of the
function or the name of the data item determines the section's name
in the output file.

<p>Use these options on systems where the linker can perform optimizations
to improve locality of reference in the instruction space.  HPPA
processors running HP-UX and Sparc processors running Solaris 2 have
linkers with such optimizations.  Other systems using the ELF object format
as well as AIX may have these optimizations in the future.

<p>Only use these options when there are significant benefits from doing
so.  When you specify these options, the assembler and linker will
create larger object and executable files and will also be slower. 
You will not be able to use <code>gprof</code> on all systems if you
specify this option and you may have problems with debugging if
you specify both this option and <code>-g</code>.

<br><dt><code>-fcaller-saves</code>
<dd>Enable values to be allocated in registers that will be clobbered by
function calls, by emitting extra instructions to save and restore the
registers around such calls.  Such allocation is done only when it
seems to result in better code than would otherwise be produced.

<p>This option is always enabled by default on certain machines, usually
those which have no call-preserved registers to use instead.

<p>For all machines, optimization level 2 and higher enables this flag by
default.

<br><dt><code>-funroll-loops</code>
<dd>Perform the optimization of loop unrolling.  This is only done for loops
whose number of iterations can be determined at compile time or run time. 
<code>-funroll-loops</code> implies both <code>-fstrength-reduce</code> and
<code>-frerun-cse-after-loop</code>.

<br><dt><code>-funroll-all-loops</code>
<dd>Perform the optimization of loop unrolling.  This is done for all loops
and usually makes programs run more slowly.  <code>-funroll-all-loops</code>
implies <code>-fstrength-reduce</code> as well as <code>-frerun-cse-after-loop</code>.

<br><dt><code>-fmove-all-movables</code>
<dd>Forces all invariant computations in loops to be moved
outside the loop.

<br><dt><code>-freduce-all-givs</code>
<dd>Forces all general-induction variables in loops to be
strength-reduced.

<p><em>Note:</em> When compiling programs written in Fortran,
<code>-fmove-all-movables</code> and <code>-freduce-all-givs</code> are enabled
by default when you use the optimizer.

<p>These options may generate better or worse code; results are highly
dependent on the structure of loops within the source code.

<p>These two options are intended to be removed someday, once
they have helped determine the efficacy of various
approaches to improving loop optimizations.

<p>Please let us (<code>gcc@gcc.gnu.org</code> and <code>fortran@gnu.org</code>)
know how use of these options affects
the performance of your production code. 
We're very interested in code that runs <em>slower</em>
when these options are <em>enabled</em>.

<br><dt><code>-fno-peephole</code>
<dd>Disable any machine-specific peephole optimizations.

<br><dt><code>-fbranch-probabilities</code>
<dd>After running a program compiled with <code>-fprofile-arcs</code>
(see <a href="#Debugging%20Options">Options for Debugging Your Program or <code>gcc</code></a>), you can compile it a second time using
<code>-fbranch-probabilities</code>, to improve optimizations based on
guessing the path a branch might take.

<p>With <code>-fbranch-probabilities</code>, GCC puts a <code>REG_EXEC_COUNT</code>
note on the first instruction of each basic block, and a
<code>REG_BR_PROB</code> note on each <code>JUMP_INSN</code> and <code>CALL_INSN</code>. 
These can be used to improve optimization.  Currently, they are only
used in one place: in <code>reorg.c</code>, instead of guessing which path a
branch is mostly to take, the <code>REG_BR_PROB</code> values are used to
exactly determine which path is taken more often.

<br><dt><code>-fstrict-aliasing</code>
<dd>Allows the compiler to assume the strictest aliasing rules applicable to
the language being compiled.  For C (and C++), this activates
optimizations based on the type of expressions.  In particular, an
object of one type is assumed never to reside at the same address as an
object of a different type, unless the types are almost the same.  For
example, an <code>unsigned int</code> can alias an <code>int</code>, but not a
<code>void*</code> or a <code>double</code>.  A character type may alias any other
type.

<p>Pay special attention to code like this:
<pre>union a_union {
  int i;
  double d;
};

int f() {
  a_union t;
  t.d = 3.0;
  return t.i;
}
</pre>
The practice of reading from a different union member than the one most
recently written to (called "type-punning") is common.  Even with
<code>-fstrict-aliasing</code>, type-punning is allowed, provided the memory
is accessed through the union type.  So, the code above will work as
expected.  However, this code might not:
<pre>int f() {
  a_union t;
  int* ip;
  t.d = 3.0;
  ip = &amp;t.i;
  return *ip;
}
</pre>

<p>Every language that wishes to perform language-specific alias analysis
should define a function that computes, given an <code>tree</code>
node, an alias set for the node.  Nodes in different alias sets are not
allowed to alias.  For an example, see the C front-end function
<code>c_get_alias_set</code>.

<h2>Options Controlling the Preprocessor</h2>

<p>These options control the C preprocessor, which is run on each C source
file before actual compilation.

<p>If you use the <code>-E</code> option, nothing is done except preprocessing. 
Some of these options make sense only together with <code>-E</code> because
they cause the preprocessor output to be unsuitable for actual
compilation.

<dl>
<dt><code>-include <var>file</var></code>
<dd>Process <var>file</var> as input before processing the regular input file. 
In effect, the contents of <var>file</var> are compiled first.  Any <code>-D</code>
and <code>-U</code> options on the command line are always processed before
<code>-include <var>file</var></code>, regardless of the order in which they are
written.  All the <code>-include</code> and <code>-imacros</code> options are
processed in the order in which they are written.

<br><dt><code>-imacros <var>file</var></code>
<dd>Process <var>file</var> as input, discarding the resulting output, before
processing the regular input file.  Because the output generated from
<var>file</var> is discarded, the only effect of <code>-imacros <var>file</var></code>
is to make the macros defined in <var>file</var> available for use in the
main input.

<p>Any <code>-D</code> and <code>-U</code> options on the command line are always
processed before <code>-imacros <var>file</var></code>, regardless of the order in
which they are written.  All the <code>-include</code> and <code>-imacros</code>
options are processed in the order in which they are written.

<br><dt><code>-idirafter <var>dir</var></code>
<dd>Add the directory <var>dir</var> to the second include path.  The directories
on the second include path are searched when a header file is not found
in any of the directories in the main include path (the one that
<code>-I</code> adds to).

<br><dt><code>-iprefix <var>prefix</var></code>
<dd>Specify <var>prefix</var> as the prefix for subsequent <code>-iwithprefix</code>
options.

<br><dt><code>-iwithprefix <var>dir</var></code>
<dd>Add a directory to the second include path.  The directory's name is
made by concatenating <var>prefix</var> and <var>dir</var>, where <var>prefix</var> was
specified previously with <code>-iprefix</code>.  If you have not specified a
prefix yet, the directory containing the installed passes of the
compiler is used as the default.

<br><dt><code>-iwithprefixbefore <var>dir</var></code>
<dd>Add a directory to the main include path.  The directory's name is made
by concatenating <var>prefix</var> and <var>dir</var>, as in the case of
<code>-iwithprefix</code>.

<br><dt><code>-isystem <var>dir</var></code>
<dd>Add a directory to the beginning of the second include path, marking it
as a system directory, so that it gets the same special treatment as
is applied to the standard system directories.

<br><dt><code>-nostdinc</code>
<dd>Do not search the standard system directories for header files.  Only
the directories you have specified with <code>-I</code> options (and the
current directory, if appropriate) are searched.  See <a href="#Directory%20Options">Directory Options</a>, for information on <code>-I</code>.

<p>By using both <code>-nostdinc</code> and <code>-I-</code>, you can limit the include-file
search path to only those directories you specify explicitly.

<br><dt><code>-undef</code>
<dd>Do not predefine any nonstandard macros.  (Including architecture flags).

<br><dt><code>-E</code>
<dd>Run only the C preprocessor.  Preprocess all the C source files
specified and output the results to standard output or to the
specified output file.

<br><dt><code>-C</code>
<dd>Tell the preprocessor not to discard comments.  Used with the
<code>-E</code> option.

<br><dt><code>-P</code>
<dd>Tell the preprocessor not to generate <code>#line</code> directives. 
Used with the <code>-E</code> option.

<br><dt><code>-M</code>
<dd>Tell the preprocessor to output a rule suitable for <code>make</code>
describing the dependencies of each object file.  For each source file,
the preprocessor outputs one <code>make</code>-rule whose target is the object
file name for that source file and whose dependencies are all the
<code>#include</code> header files it uses.  This rule may be a single line or
may be continued with <code>\</code>-newline if it is long.  The list of rules
is printed on standard output instead of the preprocessed C program.

<p><code>-M</code> implies <code>-E</code>.

<p>Another way to specify output of a <code>make</code> rule is by setting
the environment variable <code>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</code> (see <a href="#Environment%20Variables">Environment Variables</a>).

<br><dt><code>-MM</code>
<dd>Like <code>-M</code> but the output mentions only the user header files
included with <code>#include "<var>file</var>"</code>.  System header files
included with <code>#include &lt;<var>file</var>&gt;</code> are omitted.

<br><dt><code>-MD</code>
<dd>Like <code>-M</code> but the dependency information is written to a file made by
replacing ".c" with ".d" at the end of the input file names. 
This is in addition to compiling the file as specified--<code>-MD</code> does
not inhibit ordinary compilation the way <code>-M</code> does.

<p>In Mach, you can use the utility <code>md</code> to merge multiple dependency
files into a single dependency file suitable for using with the <code>make</code>
command.

<br><dt><code>-MMD</code>
<dd>Like <code>-MD</code> except mention only user header files, not system
header files.

<br><dt><code>-MG</code>
<dd>Treat missing header files as generated files and assume they live in the
same directory as the source file.  If you specify <code>-MG</code>, you
must also specify either <code>-M</code> or <code>-MM</code>.  <code>-MG</code> is not
supported with <code>-MD</code> or <code>-MMD</code>.

<br><dt><code>-H</code>
<dd>Print the name of each header file used, in addition to other normal
activities.

<br><dt><code>-A<var>question</var>(<var>answer</var>)</code>
<dd>Assert the answer <var>answer</var> for <var>question</var>, in case it is tested
with a preprocessing conditional such as <code>#if
#<var>question</var>(<var>answer</var>)</code>.  <code>-A-</code> disables the standard
assertions that normally describe the target machine.

<br><dt><code>-D<var>macro</var></code>
<dd>Define macro <var>macro</var> with the string <code>1</code> as its definition.

<br><dt><code>-D<var>macro</var>=<var>defn</var></code>
<dd>Define macro <var>macro</var> as <var>defn</var>.  All instances of <code>-D</code> on
the command line are processed before any <code>-U</code> options.

<br><dt><code>-U<var>macro</var></code>
<dd>Undefine macro <var>macro</var>.  <code>-U</code> options are evaluated after all
<code>-D</code> options, but before any <code>-include</code> and <code>-imacros</code>
options.

<br><dt><code>-dM</code>
<dd>Tell the preprocessor to output only a list of the macro definitions
that are in effect at the end of preprocessing.  Used with the <code>-E</code>
option.

<br><dt><code>-dD</code>
<dd>Tell the preprocessing to pass all macro definitions into the output, in
their proper sequence in the rest of the output.

<br><dt><code>-dN</code>
<dd>Like <code>-dD</code> except that the macro arguments and contents are omitted. 
Only <code>#define <var>name</var></code> is included in the output.

<br><dt><code>-trigraphs</code>
<dd>Support ANSI C trigraphs.  The <code>-ansi</code> option also has this effect.

<br><dt><code>-Wp,<var>option</var></code>
<dd>Pass <var>option</var> as an option to the preprocessor.  If <var>option</var>
contains commas, it is split into multiple options at the commas.

<br>

<h2>Options for Linking</h2>

<p>These options come into play when the compiler links object files into
an executable output file.  They are meaningless if the compiler is
not doing a link step.

<dl>
<dt><code><var>object-file-name</var></code>
<dd>A file name that does not end in a special recognized suffix is
considered to name an object file or library.  (Object files are
distinguished from libraries by the linker according to the file
contents.)  If linking is done, these object files are used as input
to the linker.

<br><dt><code>-c</code>
<dt><code>-S</code>
<dt><code>-E</code>
<dd>If any of these options is used, then the linker is not run, and
object file names should not be used as arguments.  See <a href="#Overall%20Options">Overall Options</a>.

<br><dt><code>-l<var>library</var></code>
<dd>Search the library named <var>library</var> when linking.

<p>It makes a difference where in the command you write this option; the
linker searches processes libraries and object files in the order they
are specified.  Thus, <code>foo.o -lz bar.o</code> searches library <code>z</code>
after file <code>foo.o</code> but before <code>bar.o</code>.  If <code>bar.o</code> refers
to functions in <code>z</code>, those functions may not be loaded.

<p>The linker searches a standard list of directories for the library,
which is actually a file named <code>lib<var>library</var>.a</code>.  The linker
then uses this file as if it had been specified precisely by name.

<p>The directories searched include several standard system directories
plus any that you specify with <code>-L</code>.

<p>Normally the files found this way are library files--archive files
whose members are object files.  The linker handles an archive file by
scanning through it for members which define symbols that have so far
been referenced but not defined.  But if the file that is found is an
ordinary object file, it is linked in the usual fashion.  The only
difference between using an <code>-l</code> option and specifying a file name
is that <code>-l</code> surrounds <var>library</var> with <code>lib</code> and <code>.a</code>
and searches several directories.

<br><dt><code>-lobjc</code>
<dd>You need this special case of the <code>-l</code> option in order to
link an Objective C program.

<br><dt><code>-nostartfiles</code>
<dd>Do not use the standard system startup files when linking. 
The standard system libraries are used normally, unless <code>-nostdlib</code>
or <code>-nodefaultlibs</code> is used.

<br><dt><code>-nodefaultlibs</code>
<dd>Do not use the standard system libraries when linking. 
Only the libraries you specify will be passed to the linker. 
The standard startup files are used normally, unless <code>-nostartfiles</code>
is used.  The compiler may generate calls to memcmp, memset, and memcpy
for System V (and ANSI C) environments or to bcopy and bzero for
BSD environments.  These entries are usually resolved by entries in
libc.  These entry points should be supplied through some other
mechanism when this option is specified.

<br><dt><code>-nostdlib</code>
<dd>Do not use the standard system startup files or libraries when linking. 
No startup files and only the libraries you specify will be passed to
the linker. The compiler may generate calls to memcmp, memset, and memcpy
for System V (and ANSI C) environments or to bcopy and bzero for
BSD environments.  These entries are usually resolved by entries in
libc.  These entry points should be supplied through some other
mechanism when this option is specified.

<p>One of the standard libraries bypassed by <code>-nostdlib</code> and
<code>-nodefaultlibs</code> is <code>libgcc.a</code>, a library of internal subroutines
that GCC uses to overcome shortcomings of particular machines, or special
needs for some languages. 
(See <a href="#Interface">Interfacing to GCC Output</a>, for more discussion of
<code>libgcc.a</code>.) 
In most cases, you need <code>libgcc.a</code> even when you want to avoid
other standard libraries.  In other words, when you specify <code>-nostdlib</code>
or <code>-nodefaultlibs</code> you should usually specify <code>-lgcc</code> as well. 
This ensures that you have no unresolved references to internal GCC
library subroutines.  (For example, <code>__main</code>, used to ensure C++
constructors will be called; see <a href="#Collect2"><code>collect2</code></a>.)

<br><dt><code>-s</code>
<dd>Remove all symbol table and relocation information from the executable.

<br><dt><code>-static</code>
<dd>On systems that support dynamic linking, this prevents linking with the shared
libraries.  On other systems, this option has no effect.

<br><dt><code>-shared</code>
<dd>Produce a shared object which can then be linked with other objects to
form an executable.  Not all systems support this option.  You must
also specify <code>-fpic</code> or <code>-fPIC</code> on some systems when
you specify this option.

<br><dt><code>-symbolic</code>
<dd>Bind references to global symbols when building a shared object.  Warn
about any unresolved references (unless overridden by the link editor
option <code>-Xlinker -z -Xlinker defs</code>).  Only a few systems support
this option.

<br><dt><code>-Xlinker <var>option</var></code>
<dd>Pass <var>option</var> as an option to the linker.  You can use this to
supply system-specific linker options which GCC does not know how to
recognize.

<p>If you want to pass an option that takes an argument, you must use
<code>-Xlinker</code> twice, once for the option and once for the argument. 
For example, to pass <code>-assert definitions</code>, you must write
<code>-Xlinker -assert -Xlinker definitions</code>.  It does not work to write
<code>-Xlinker "-assert definitions"</code>, because this passes the entire
string as a single argument, which is not what the linker expects.

<br><dt><code>-Wl,<var>option</var></code>
<dd>Pass <var>option</var> as an option to the linker.  If <var>option</var> contains
commas, it is split into multiple options at the commas.

<br><dt><code>-u <var>symbol</var></code>
<dd>Pretend the symbol <var>symbol</var> is undefined, to force linking of
library modules to define it.  You can use <code>-u</code> multiple times with
different symbols to force loading of additional library modules.

<h2>Options for Directory Search</h2>

<p>These options specify directories to search for header files, for
libraries and for parts of the compiler:

<dl>
<dt><code>-I<var>dir</var></code>
<dd>Add the directory <var>dir</var> to the head of the list of directories to be
searched for header files.  This can be used to override a system header
file, substituting your own version, since these directories are
searched before the system header file directories.  If you use more
than one <code>-I</code> option, the directories are scanned in left-to-right
order; the standard system directories come after.

<br><dt><code>-I-</code>
<dd>Any directories you specify with <code>-I</code> options before the <code>-I-</code>
option are searched only for the case of <code>#include "<var>file</var>"</code>;
they are not searched for <code>#include &lt;<var>file</var>&gt;</code>.

<p>If additional directories are specified with <code>-I</code> options after
the <code>-I-</code>, these directories are searched for all <code>#include</code>
directives.  (Ordinarily <em>all</em> <code>-I</code> directories are used
this way.)

<p>In addition, the <code>-I-</code> option inhibits the use of the current
directory (where the current input file came from) as the first search
directory for <code>#include "<var>file</var>"</code>.  There is no way to
override this effect of <code>-I-</code>.  With <code>-I.</code> you can specify
searching the directory which was current when the compiler was
invoked.  That is not exactly the same as what the preprocessor does
by default, but it is often satisfactory.

<p><code>-I-</code> does not inhibit the use of the standard system directories
for header files.  Thus, <code>-I-</code> and <code>-nostdinc</code> are
independent.

<br><dt><code>-L<var>dir</var></code>
<dd>Add directory <var>dir</var> to the list of directories to be searched
for <code>-l</code>.

<br><dt><code>-B<var>prefix</var></code>
<dd>This option specifies where to find the executables, libraries,
include files, and data files of the compiler itself.

<p>The compiler driver program runs one or more of the subprograms
<code>cpp</code>, <code>cc1</code>, <code>as</code> and <code>ld</code>.  It tries
<var>prefix</var> as a prefix for each program it tries to run, both with and
without <code><var>machine</var>/<var>version</var>/</code> (see <a href="#Target%20Options">Target Options</a>).

<p>For each subprogram to be run, the compiler driver first tries the
<code>-B</code> prefix, if any.  If that name is not found, or if <code>-B</code>
was not specified, the driver tries two standard prefixes, which are
<code>/usr/lib/gcc/</code> and <code>/usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/</code>.  If neither of
those results in a file name that is found, the unmodified program
name is searched for using the directories specified in your
<code>PATH</code> environment variable.

<p><code>-B</code> prefixes that effectively specify directory names also apply
to libraries in the linker, because the compiler translates these
options into <code>-L</code> options for the linker.  They also apply to
includes files in the preprocessor, because the compiler translates these
options into <code>-isystem</code> options for the preprocessor.  In this case,
the compiler appends <code>include</code> to the prefix.

<p>The run-time support file <code>libgcc.a</code> can also be searched for using
the <code>-B</code> prefix, if needed.  If it is not found there, the two
standard prefixes above are tried, and that is all.  The file is left
out of the link if it is not found by those means.

<p>Another way to specify a prefix much like the <code>-B</code> prefix is to use
the environment variable <code>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</code>.  See <a href="#Environment%20Variables">Environment Variables</a>.

<br><dt><code>-specs=<var>file</var></code>
<dd>Process <var>file</var> after the compiler reads in the standard <code>specs</code>
file, in order to override the defaults that the <code>gcc</code> driver
program uses when determining what switches to pass to <code>cc1</code>,
<code>cc1plus</code>, <code>as</code>, <code>ld</code>, etc.  More than one
<code>-specs=</code><var>file</var> can be specified on the command line, and they
are processed in order, from left to right.

<h2>Specifying Target Machine and Compiler Version</h2>

<p>By default, GCC compiles code for the same type of machine that you
are using.  However, it can also be installed as a cross-compiler, to
compile for some other type of machine.  In fact, several different
configurations of GCC, for different target machines, can be
installed side by side.  Then you specify which one to use with the
<code>-b</code> option.

<p>In addition, older and newer versions of GCC can be installed side
by side.  One of them (probably the newest) will be the default, but
you may sometimes wish to use another.

<dl>
<dt><code>-b <var>machine</var></code>
<dd>The argument <var>machine</var> specifies the target machine for compilation. 
This is useful when you have installed GCC as a cross-compiler.

<p>The value to use for <var>machine</var> is the same as was specified as the
machine type when configuring GCC as a cross-compiler.  For
example, if a cross-compiler was configured with <code>configure
i386v</code>, meaning to compile for an 80386 running System V, then you
would specify <code>-b i386v</code> to run that cross compiler.

<p>When you do not specify <code>-b</code>, it normally means to compile for
the same type of machine that you are using.

<br><dt><code>-V <var>version</var></code>
<dd>The argument <var>version</var> specifies which version of GCC to run. 
This is useful when multiple versions are installed.  For example,
<var>version</var> might be <code>2.0</code>, meaning to run GCC version 2.0.

<p>The default version, when you do not specify <code>-V</code>, is the last
version of GCC that you installed. 
</dl>

<p>The <code>-b</code> and <code>-V</code> options actually work by controlling part of
the file name used for the executable files and libraries used for
compilation.  A given version of GCC, for a given target machine, is
normally kept in the directory <code>/usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/<var>machine</var>/<var>version</var></code>.

<p>Thus, sites can customize the effect of <code>-b</code> or <code>-V</code> either by
changing the names of these directories or adding alternate names (or
symbolic links).  If in directory <code>/usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/</code> the
file <code>80386</code> is a link to the file <code>i386v</code>, then <code>-b
80386</code> becomes an alias for <code>-b i386v</code>.

<p>In one respect, the <code>-b</code> or <code>-V</code> do not completely change
to a different compiler: the top-level driver program <code>gcc</code>
that you originally invoked continues to run and invoke the other
executables (preprocessor, compiler per se, assembler and linker)
that do the real work.  However, since no real work is done in the
driver program, it usually does not matter that the driver program
in use is not the one for the specified target and version.

<p>The only way that the driver program depends on the target machine is
in the parsing and handling of special machine-specific options. 
However, this is controlled by a file which is found, along with the
other executables, in the directory for the specified version and
target machine.  As a result, a single installed driver program adapts
to any specified target machine and compiler version.

<p>The driver program executable does control one significant thing,
however: the default version and target machine.  Therefore, you can
install different instances of the driver program, compiled for
different targets or versions, under different names.

<p>For example, if the driver for version 2.0 is installed as <code>ogcc</code>
and that for version 2.1 is installed as <code>gcc</code>, then the command
<code>gcc</code> will use version 2.1 by default, while <code>ogcc</code> will use
2.0 by default.  However, you can choose either version with either
command with the <code>-V</code> option.

<h2>Hardware Models and Configurations</h2>

<p>Earlier we discussed the standard option <code>-b</code> which chooses among
different installed compilers for completely different target
machines, such as Vax vs. 68000 vs. 80386.

<p>In addition, each of these target machine types can have its own
special options, starting with <code>-m</code>, to choose among various
hardware models or configurations--for example, 68010 vs 68020,
floating coprocessor or none.  A single installed version of the
compiler can compile for any model or configuration, according to the
options specified.

<p>Some configurations of the compiler also support additional special
options, usually for compatibility with other compilers on the same
platform.

<p>These options are defined by the macro <code>TARGET_SWITCHES</code> in the
machine description.  The default for the options is also defined by
that macro, which enables you to change the defaults.

<h3>M680x0 Options</h3>

<p>These are the <code>-m</code> options defined for the 68000 series.  The default
values for these options depends on which style of 68000 was selected when
the compiler was configured; the defaults for the most common choices are
given below.

<dl>
<dt><code>-m68000</code>
<dt><code>-mc68000</code>
<dd>Generate output for a 68000.  This is the default
when the compiler is configured for 68000-based systems.

<p>Use this option for microcontrollers with a 68000 or EC000 core,
including the 68008, 68302, 68306, 68307, 68322, 68328 and 68356.

<br><dt><code>-m68020</code>
<dt><code>-mc68020</code>
<dd>Generate output for a 68020.  This is the default
when the compiler is configured for 68020-based systems.

<br><dt><code>-m68881</code>
<dd>Generate output containing 68881 instructions for floating point. 
This is the default for most 68020 systems unless <code>-nfp</code> was
specified when the compiler was configured.

<br><dt><code>-m68030</code>
<dd>Generate output for a 68030.  This is the default when the compiler is
configured for 68030-based systems.

<br><dt><code>-m68040</code>
<dd>Generate output for a 68040.  This is the default when the compiler is
configured for 68040-based systems.

<p>This option inhibits the use of 68881/68882 instructions that have to be
emulated by software on the 68040.  Use this option if your 68040 does not
have code to emulate those instructions.

<br><dt><code>-m68060</code>
<dd>Generate output for a 68060.  This is the default when the compiler is
configured for 68060-based systems.

<p>This option inhibits the use of 68020 and 68881/68882 instructions that
have to be emulated by software on the 68060.  Use this option if your 68060
does not have code to emulate those instructions.

<br><dt><code>-mcpu32</code>
<dd>Generate output for a CPU32. This is the default
when the compiler is configured for CPU32-based systems.

<p>Use this option for microcontrollers with a
CPU32 or CPU32+ core, including the 68330, 68331, 68332, 68333, 68334,
68336, 68340, 68341, 68349 and 68360.

<br><dt><code>-m5200</code>
<dd>Generate output for a 520X "coldfire" family cpu.  This is the default
when the compiler is configured for 520X-based systems.

<p>Use this option for microcontroller with a 5200 core, including
the MCF5202, MCF5203, MCF5204 and MCF5202.

<br><dt><code>-m68020-40</code>
<dd>Generate output for a 68040, without using any of the new instructions. 
This results in code which can run relatively efficiently on either a
68020/68881 or a 68030 or a 68040.  The generated code does use the
68881 instructions that are emulated on the 68040.

<br><dt><code>-m68020-60</code>
<dd>Generate output for a 68060, without using any of the new instructions. 
This results in code which can run relatively efficiently on either a
68020/68881 or a 68030 or a 68040.  The generated code does use the
68881 instructions that are emulated on the 68060.

<br><dt><code>-mfpa</code>
<dd>Generate output containing Sun FPA instructions for floating point.

<br><dt><code>-msoft-float</code>
<dd>Generate output containing library calls for floating point. 
<strong>Warning:</strong> the requisite libraries are not available for all m68k
targets.  Normally the facilities of the machine's usual C compiler are
used, but this can't be done directly in cross-compilation.  You must
make your own arrangements to provide suitable library functions for
cross-compilation.  The embedded targets <code>m68k-*-aout</code> and
<code>m68k-*-coff</code> do provide software floating point support.

<br><dt><code>-mshort</code>
<dd>Consider type <code>int</code> to be 16 bits wide, like <code>short int</code>.

<br><dt><code>-mnobitfield</code>
<dd>Do not use the bit-field instructions.  The <code>-m68000</code>, <code>-mcpu32</code>
and <code>-m5200</code> options imply <code>-mnobitfield</code>.

<br><dt><code>-mbitfield</code>
<dd>Do use the bit-field instructions.  The <code>-m68020</code> option implies
<code>-mbitfield</code>.  This is the default if you use a configuration
designed for a 68020.

<br><dt><code>-mrtd</code>
<dd>Use a different function-calling convention, in which functions
that take a fixed number of arguments return with the <code>rtd</code>
instruction, which pops their arguments while returning.  This
saves one instruction in the caller since there is no need to pop
the arguments there.

<p>This calling convention is incompatible with the one normally
used on Unix, so you cannot use it if you need to call libraries
compiled with the Unix compiler.

<p>Also, you must provide function prototypes for all functions that
take variable numbers of arguments (including <code>printf</code>);
otherwise incorrect code will be generated for calls to those
functions.

<p>In addition, seriously incorrect code will result if you call a
function with too many arguments.  (Normally, extra arguments are
harmlessly ignored.)

<p>The <code>rtd</code> instruction is supported by the 68010, 68020, 68030,
68040, 68060 and CPU32 processors, but not by the 68000 or 5200.

<br><dt><code>-malign-int</code>
<dt><code>-mno-align-int</code>
<dd>Control whether GCC aligns <code>int</code>, <code>long</code>, <code>long long</code>,
<code>float</code>, <code>double</code>, and <code>long double</code> variables on a 32-bit
boundary (<code>-malign-int</code>) or a 16-bit boundary (<code>-mno-align-int</code>). 
Aligning variables on 32-bit boundaries produces code that runs somewhat
faster on processors with 32-bit busses at the expense of more memory.

<p><strong>Warning:</strong> if you use the <code>-malign-int</code> switch, GCC will
align structures containing the above types  differently than
most published application binary interface specifications for the m68k.

<h3>VAX Options</h3>

<p>These <code>-m</code> options are defined for the Vax:

<dl>
<dt><code>-munix</code>
<dd>Do not output certain jump instructions (<code>aobleq</code> and so on)
that the Unix assembler for the Vax cannot handle across long
ranges.

<br><dt><code>-mgnu</code>
<dd>Do output those jump instructions, on the assumption that you
will assemble with the GNU assembler.

<br><dt><code>-mg</code>
<dd>Output code for g-format floating point numbers instead of d-format.

<br>

<h3>SPARC Options</h3>

<p>These <code>-m</code> switches are supported on the SPARC:

<dl>
<dt><code>-mno-app-regs</code>
<dt><code>-mapp-regs</code>
<dd>Specify <code>-mapp-regs</code> to generate output using the global registers
2 through 4, which the SPARC SVR4 ABI reserves for applications.  This
is the default.

<p>To be fully SVR4 ABI compliant at the cost of some performance loss,
specify <code>-mno-app-regs</code>.  You should compile libraries and system
software with this option.

<br><dt><code>-mfpu</code>
<dt><code>-mhard-float</code>
<dd>Generate output containing floating point instructions.  This is the
default.

<br><dt><code>-mno-fpu</code>
<dt><code>-msoft-float</code>
<dd>Generate output containing library calls for floating point. 
<strong>Warning:</strong> the requisite libraries are not available for all SPARC
targets.  Normally the facilities of the machine's usual C compiler are
used, but this cannot be done directly in cross-compilation.  You must make
your own arrangements to provide suitable library functions for
cross-compilation.  The embedded targets <code>sparc-*-aout</code> and
<code>sparclite-*-*</code> do provide software floating point support.

<p><code>-msoft-float</code> changes the calling convention in the output file;
therefore, it is only useful if you compile <em>all</em> of a program with
this option.  In particular, you need to compile <code>libgcc.a</code>, the
library that comes with GCC, with <code>-msoft-float</code> in order for
this to work.

<br><dt><code>-mhard-quad-float</code>
<dd>Generate output containing quad-word (long double) floating point
instructions.

<br><dt><code>-msoft-quad-float</code>
<dd>Generate output containing library calls for quad-word (long double)
floating point instructions.  The functions called are those specified
in the SPARC ABI.  This is the default.

<p>As of this writing, there are no sparc implementations that have hardware
support for the quad-word floating point instructions.  They all invoke
a trap handler for one of these instructions, and then the trap handler
emulates the effect of the instruction.  Because of the trap handler overhead,
this is much slower than calling the ABI library routines.  Thus the
<code>-msoft-quad-float</code> option is the default.

<br><dt><code>-mno-epilogue</code>
<dt><code>-mepilogue</code>
<dd>With <code>-mepilogue</code> (the default), the compiler always emits code for
function exit at the end of each function.  Any function exit in
the middle of the function (such as a return statement in C) will
generate a jump to the exit code at the end of the function.

<p>With <code>-mno-epilogue</code>, the compiler tries to emit exit code inline
at every function exit.

<br><dt><code>-mno-flat</code>
<dt><code>-mflat</code>
<dd>With <code>-mflat</code>, the compiler does not generate save/restore instructions
and will use a "flat" or single register window calling convention. 
This model uses %i7 as the frame pointer and is compatible with the normal
register window model.  Code from either may be intermixed. 
The local registers and the input registers (0-5) are still treated as
"call saved" registers and will be saved on the stack as necessary.

<p>With <code>-mno-flat</code> (the default), the compiler emits save/restore
instructions (except for leaf functions) and is the normal mode of operation.

<br><dt><code>-mno-unaligned-doubles</code>
<dt><code>-munaligned-doubles</code>
<dd>Assume that doubles have 8 byte alignment.  This is the default.

<p>With <code>-munaligned-doubles</code>, GCC assumes that doubles have 8 byte
alignment only if they are contained in another type, or if they have an
absolute address.  Otherwise, it assumes they have 4 byte alignment. 
Specifying this option avoids some rare compatibility problems with code
generated by other compilers.  It is not the default because it results
in a performance loss, especially for floating point code.

<br><dt><code>-mv8</code>
<dt><code>-msparclite</code>
<dd>These two options select variations on the SPARC architecture.

<p>By default (unless specifically configured for the Fujitsu SPARClite),
GCC generates code for the v7 variant of the SPARC architecture.

<p><code>-mv8</code> will give you SPARC v8 code.  The only difference from v7
code is that the compiler emits the integer multiply and integer
divide instructions which exist in SPARC v8 but not in SPARC v7.

<p><code>-msparclite</code> will give you SPARClite code.  This adds the integer
multiply, integer divide step and scan (<code>ffs</code>) instructions which
exist in SPARClite but not in SPARC v7.

<p>These options are deprecated and will be deleted in a future GCC release. 
They have been replaced with <code>-mcpu=xxx</code>.

<br><dt><code>-mcypress</code>
<dt><code>-msupersparc</code>
<dd>These two options select the processor for which the code is optimised.

<p>With <code>-mcypress</code> (the default), the compiler optimizes code for the
Cypress CY7C602 chip, as used in the SparcStation/SparcServer 3xx series. 
This is also appropriate for the older SparcStation 1, 2, IPX etc.

<p>With <code>-msupersparc</code> the compiler optimizes code for the SuperSparc cpu, as
used in the SparcStation 10, 1000 and 2000 series. This flag also enables use
of the full SPARC v8 instruction set.

<p>These options are deprecated and will be deleted in a future GCC release. 
They have been replaced with <code>-mcpu=xxx</code>.

<br><dt><code>-mcpu=<var>cpu_type</var></code>
<dd>Set the instruction set, register set, and instruction scheduling parameters
for machine type <var>cpu_type</var>.  Supported values for <var>cpu_type</var> are
<code>v7</code>, <code>cypress</code>, <code>v8</code>, <code>supersparc</code>, <code>sparclite</code>,
<code>hypersparc</code>, <code>sparclite86x</code>, <code>f930</code>, <code>f934</code>,
<code>sparclet</code>, <code>tsc701</code>, <code>v9</code>, and <code>ultrasparc</code>.

<p>Default instruction scheduling parameters are used for values that select
an architecture and not an implementation.  These are <code>v7</code>, <code>v8</code>,
<code>sparclite</code>, <code>sparclet</code>, <code>v9</code>.

<p>Here is a list of each supported architecture and their supported
implementations.

<pre>    v7:             cypress
    v8:             supersparc, hypersparc
    sparclite:      f930, f934, sparclite86x
    sparclet:       tsc701
    v9:             ultrasparc
</pre>

<br><dt><code>-mtune=<var>cpu_type</var></code>
<dd>Set the instruction scheduling parameters for machine type
<var>cpu_type</var>, but do not set the instruction set or register set that the
option <code>-mcpu=</code><var>cpu_type</var> would.

<p>The same values for <code>-mcpu=</code><var>cpu_type</var> are used for
<code>-mtune=</code><br><var>cpu_type</var>, though the only useful values are those that
select a particular cpu implementation: <code>cypress</code>, <code>supersparc</code>,
<code>hypersparc</code>, <code>f930</code>, <code>f934</code>, <code>sparclite86x</code>,
<code>tsc701</code>, <code>ultrasparc</code>.

<br><dt><code>-malign-loops=<var>num</var></code>
<dd>Align loops to a 2 raised to a <var>num</var> byte boundary.  If
<code>-malign-loops</code> is not specified, the default is 2.

<br><dt><code>-malign-jumps=<var>num</var></code>
<dd>Align instructions that are only jumped to to a 2 raised to a <var>num</var>
byte boundary.  If <code>-malign-jumps</code> is not specified, the default is 2.

<br><dt><code>-malign-functions=<var>num</var></code>
<dd>Align the start of functions to a 2 raised to <var>num</var> byte boundary. 
If <code>-malign-functions</code> is not specified, the default is 2 if compiling
for 32 bit sparc, and 5 if compiling for 64 bit sparc.

</dl>

<p>These <code>-m</code> switches are supported in addition to the above
on the SPARCLET processor.

<dl>
<dt><code>-mlittle-endian</code>
<dd>Generate code for a processor running in little-endian mode.

<br><dt><code>-mlive-g0</code>
<dd>Treat register <code>%g0</code> as a normal register. 
GCC will continue to clobber it as necessary but will not assume
it always reads as 0.

<br><dt><code>-mbroken-saverestore</code>
<dd>Generate code that does not use non-trivial forms of the <code>save</code> and
<code>restore</code> instructions.  Early versions of the SPARCLET processor do
not correctly handle <code>save</code> and <code>restore</code> instructions used with
arguments.  They correctly handle them used without arguments.  A <code>save</code>
instruction used without arguments increments the current window pointer
but does not allocate a new stack frame.  It is assumed that the window
overflow trap handler will properly handle this case as will interrupt
handlers. 
</dl>

<p>These <code>-m</code> switches are supported in addition to the above
on SPARC V9 processors in 64 bit environments.

<dl>
<dt><code>-mlittle-endian</code>
<dd>Generate code for a processor running in little-endian mode.

<br><dt><code>-m32</code>
<dt><code>-m64</code>
<dd>Generate code for a 32 bit or 64 bit environment. 
The 32 bit environment sets int, long and pointer to 32 bits. 
The 64 bit environment sets int to 32 bits and long and pointer
to 64 bits.

<br><dt><code>-mcmodel=medlow</code>
<dd>Generate code for the Medium/Low code model: the program must be linked
in the low 32 bits of the address space.  Pointers are 64 bits. 
Programs can be statically or dynamically linked.

<br><dt><code>-mcmodel=medmid</code>
<dd>Generate code for the Medium/Middle code model: the program must be linked
in the low 44 bits of the address space, the text segment must be less than
2G bytes, and data segment must be within 2G of the text segment. 
Pointers are 64 bits.

<br><dt><code>-mcmodel=medany</code>
<dd>Generate code for the Medium/Anywhere code model: the program may be linked
anywhere in the address space, the text segment must be less than
2G bytes, and data segment must be within 2G of the text segment. 
Pointers are 64 bits.

<br><dt><code>-mcmodel=embmedany</code>
<dd>Generate code for the Medium/Anywhere code model for embedded systems:
assume a 32 bit text and a 32 bit data segment, both starting anywhere
(determined at link time).  Register %g4 points to the base of the
data segment.  Pointers still 64 bits. 
Programs are statically linked, PIC is not supported.

<br><dt><code>-mstack-bias</code>
<dt><code>-mno-stack-bias</code>
<dd>With <code>-mstack-bias</code>, GCC assumes that the stack pointer, and
frame pointer if present, are offset by -2047 which must be added back
when making stack frame references. 
Otherwise, assume no such offset is present.

<h3>Convex Options</h3>

<p>These <code>-m</code> options are defined for Convex:

<dl>
<dt><code>-mc1</code>
<dd>Generate output for C1.  The code will run on any Convex machine. 
The preprocessor symbol <code>__convex__c1__</code> is defined.

<br><dt><code>-mc2</code>
<dd>Generate output for C2.  Uses instructions not available on C1. 
Scheduling and other optimizations are chosen for max performance on C2. 
The preprocessor symbol <code>__convex_c2__</code> is defined.

<br><dt><code>-mc32</code>
<dd>Generate output for C32xx.  Uses instructions not available on C1. 
Scheduling and other optimizations are chosen for max performance on C32. 
The preprocessor symbol <code>__convex_c32__</code> is defined.

<br><dt><code>-mc34</code>
<dd>Generate output for C34xx.  Uses instructions not available on C1. 
Scheduling and other optimizations are chosen for max performance on C34. 
The preprocessor symbol <code>__convex_c34__</code> is defined.

<br><dt><code>-mc38</code>
<dd>Generate output for C38xx.  Uses instructions not available on C1. 
Scheduling and other optimizations are chosen for max performance on C38. 
The preprocessor symbol <code>__convex_c38__</code> is defined.

<br><dt><code>-margcount</code>
<dd>Generate code which puts an argument count in the word preceding each
argument list.  This is compatible with regular CC, and a few programs
may need the argument count word.  GDB and other source-level debuggers
do not need it; this info is in the symbol table.

<br><dt><code>-mnoargcount</code>
<dd>Omit the argument count word.  This is the default.

<br><dt><code>-mvolatile-cache</code>
<dd>Allow volatile references to be cached.  This is the default.

<br><dt><code>-mvolatile-nocache</code>
<dd>Volatile references bypass the data cache, going all the way to memory. 
This is only needed for multi-processor code that does not use standard
synchronization instructions.  Making non-volatile references to volatile
locations will not necessarily work.

<br><dt><code>-mlong32</code>
<dd>Type long is 32 bits, the same as type int.  This is the default.

<br><dt><code>-mlong64</code>
<dd>Type long is 64 bits, the same as type long long.  This option is useless,
because no library support exists for it.

<h3>AMD29K Options</h3>

<p>These <code>-m</code> options are defined for the AMD Am29000:

<dl>
<dt><code>-mdw</code>
<dd>Generate code that assumes the <code>DW</code> bit is set, i.e., that byte and
halfword operations are directly supported by the hardware.  This is the
default.

<br><dt><code>-mndw</code>
<dd>Generate code that assumes the <code>DW</code> bit is not set.

<br><dt><code>-mbw</code>
<dd>Generate code that assumes the system supports byte and halfword write
operations.  This is the default.

<br><dt><code>-mnbw</code>
<dd>Generate code that assumes the systems does not support byte and
halfword write operations.  <code>-mnbw</code> implies <code>-mndw</code>.

<br><dt><code>-msmall</code>
<dd>Use a small memory model that assumes that all function addresses are
either within a single 256 KB segment or at an absolute address of less
than 256k.  This allows the <code>call</code> instruction to be used instead
of a <code>const</code>, <code>consth</code>, <code>calli</code> sequence.

<br><dt><code>-mnormal</code>
<dd>Use the normal memory model: Generate <code>call</code> instructions only when
calling functions in the same file and <code>calli</code> instructions
otherwise.  This works if each file occupies less than 256 KB but allows
the entire executable to be larger than 256 KB.  This is the default.

<br><dt><code>-mlarge</code>
<dd>Always use <code>calli</code> instructions.  Specify this option if you expect
a single file to compile into more than 256 KB of code.

<br><dt><code>-m29050</code>
<dd>Generate code for the Am29050.

<br><dt><code>-m29000</code>
<dd>Generate code for the Am29000.  This is the default.

<br><dt><code>-mkernel-registers</code>
<dd>Generate references to registers <code>gr64-gr95</code> instead of to
registers <code>gr96-gr127</code>.  This option can be used when compiling
kernel code that wants a set of global registers disjoint from that used
by user-mode code.

<p>Note that when this option is used, register names in <code>-f</code> flags
must use the normal, user-mode, names.

<br><dt><code>-muser-registers</code>
<dd>Use the normal set of global registers, <code>gr96-gr127</code>.  This is the
default.

<br><dt><code>-mstack-check</code>
<dt><code>-mno-stack-check</code>
<dd>Insert (or do not insert) a call to <code>__msp_check</code> after each stack
adjustment.  This is often used for kernel code.

<br><dt><code>-mstorem-bug</code>
<dt><code>-mno-storem-bug</code>
<dd><code>-mstorem-bug</code> handles 29k processors which cannot handle the
separation of a mtsrim insn and a storem instruction (most 29000 chips
to date, but not the 29050).

<br><dt><code>-mno-reuse-arg-regs</code>
<dt><code>-mreuse-arg-regs</code>
<dd><code>-mno-reuse-arg-regs</code> tells the compiler to only use incoming argument
registers for copying out arguments.  This helps detect calling a function
with fewer arguments than it was declared with.

<br><dt><code>-mno-impure-text</code>
<dt><code>-mimpure-text</code>
<dd><code>-mimpure-text</code>, used in addition to <code>-shared</code>, tells the compiler to
not pass <code>-assert pure-text</code> to the linker when linking a shared object.

<br><dt><code>-msoft-float</code>
<dd>Generate output containing library calls for floating point. 
<strong>Warning:</strong> the requisite libraries are not part of GCC. 
Normally the facilities of the machine's usual C compiler are used, but
this can't be done directly in cross-compilation.  You must make your
own arrangements to provide suitable library functions for
cross-compilation.

<br><dt><code>-mno-multm</code>
<dd>Do not generate multm or multmu instructions.  This is useful for some embedded
systems which do not have trap handlers for these instructions.

<h3>ARM Options</h3>

<p>These <code>-m</code> options are defined for Advanced RISC Machines (ARM)
architectures:

<dl>
<dt><code>-mapcs-frame</code>
<dd>Generate a stack frame that is compliant with the ARM Procedure Call
Standard for all functions, even if this is not strictly necessary for
correct execution of the code.  Specifying <code>-fomit-frame-pointer</code>
with this option will cause the stack frames not to be generated for
leaf functions.  The default is <code>-mno-apcs-frame</code>.

<br><dt><code>-mapcs</code>
<dd>This is a synonym for <code>-mapcs-frame</code>.

<br><dt><code>-mapcs-26</code>
<dd>Generate code for a processor running with a 26-bit program counter,
and conforming to the function calling standards for the APCS 26-bit
option.  This option replaces the <code>-m2</code> and <code>-m3</code> options
of previous releases of the compiler.

<br><dt><code>-mapcs-32</code>
<dd>Generate code for a processor running with a 32-bit program counter,
and conforming to the function calling standards for the APCS 32-bit
option.  This option replaces the <code>-m6</code> option of previous releases
of the compiler.

<br><dt><code>-mapcs-stack-check</code>
<dd>Generate code to check the amount of stack space available upon entry to
every function (that actually uses some stack space).  If there is
insufficient space available then either the function
<code>__rt_stkovf_split_small</code> or <code>__rt_stkovf_split_big</code> will be
called, depending upon the amount of stack space required.  The run time
system is required to provide these functions.  The default is
<code>-mno-apcs-stack-check</code>, since this produces smaller code.

<br><dt><code>-mapcs-float</code>
<dd>Pass floating point arguments using the float point registers.  This is
one of the variants of the APCS.  This option is reccommended if the
target hardware has a floating point unit or if a lot of floating point
arithmetic is going to be performed by the code.  The default is
<code>-mno-apcs-float</code>, since integer only code is slightly increased in
size if <code>-mapcs-float</code> is used.

<br><dt><code>-mapcs-reentrant</code>
<dd>Generate reentrant, position independent code.  This is the equivalent
to specifying the <code>-fpic</code> option.  The default is
<code>-mno-apcs-reentrant</code>.

<br><dt><code>-mthumb-interwork</code>
<dd>Generate code which supports calling between the ARM and THUMB
instruction sets.  Without this option the two instruction sets cannot
be reliably used inside one program.  The default is
<code>-mno-thumb-interwork</code>, since slightly larger code is generated
when <code>-mthumb-interwork</code> is specified.

<br><dt><code>-mno-sched-prolog</code>
<dd>Prevent the reordering of instructions in the function prolog, or the
merging of those instruction with the instructions in the function's
body.  This means that all functions will start with a recognisable set
of instructions (or in fact one of a chioce from a small set of
different function prologues), and this information can be used to
locate the start if functions inside an executable piece of code.  The
default is <code>-msched-prolog</code>.

<br><dt><code>-mhard-float</code>
<dd>Generate output containing floating point instructions.  This is the
default.

<br><dt><code>-msoft-float</code>
<dd>Generate output containing library calls for floating point. 
<strong>Warning:</strong> the requisite libraries are not available for all ARM
targets.  Normally the facilities of the machine's usual C compiler are
used, but this cannot be done directly in cross-compilation.  You must make
your own arrangements to provide suitable library functions for
cross-compilation.

<p><code>-msoft-float</code> changes the calling convention in the output file;
therefore, it is only useful if you compile <em>all</em> of a program with
this option.  In particular, you need to compile <code>libgcc.a</code>, the
library that comes with GCC, with <code>-msoft-float</code> in order for
this to work.

<br><dt><code>-mlittle-endian</code>
<dd>Generate code for a processor running in little-endian mode.  This is
the default for all standard configurations.

<br><dt><code>-mbig-endian</code>
<dd>Generate code for a processor running in big-endian mode; the default is
to compile code for a little-endian processor.

<br><dt><code>-mwords-little-endian</code>
<dd>This option only applies when generating code for big-endian processors. 
Generate code for a little-endian word order but a big-endian byte
order.  That is, a byte order of the form <code>32107654</code>.  Note: this
option should only be used if you require compatibility with code for
big-endian ARM processors generated by versions of the compiler prior to
2.8.

<br><dt><code>-mshort-load-bytes</code>
<dd>Do not try to load half-words (eg <code>short</code>s) by loading a word from
an unaligned address.  For some targets the MMU is configured to trap
unaligned loads; use this option to generate code that is safe in these
environments.

<br><dt><code>-mno-short-load-bytes</code>
<dd>Use unaligned word loads to load half-words (eg <code>short</code>s).  This
option produces more efficient code, but the MMU is sometimes configured
to trap these instructions.

<br><dt><code>-mshort-load-words</code>
<dd>This is a synonym for the <code>-mno-short-load-bytes</code>.

<br><dt><code>-mno-short-load-words</code>
<dd>This is a synonym for the <code>-mshort-load-bytes</code>.

<br><dt><code>-mbsd</code>
<dd>This option only applies to RISC iX.  Emulate the native BSD-mode
compiler.  This is the default if <code>-ansi</code> is not specified.

<br><dt><code>-mxopen</code>
<dd>This option only applies to RISC iX.  Emulate the native X/Open-mode
compiler.

<br><dt><code>-mno-symrename</code>
<dd>This option only applies to RISC iX.  Do not run the assembler
post-processor, <code>symrename</code>, after code has been assembled. 
Normally it is necessary to modify some of the standard symbols in
preparation for linking with the RISC iX C library; this option
suppresses this pass.  The post-processor is never run when the
compiler is built for cross-compilation.

<br><dt><code>-mcpu=&lt;name&gt;</code>
<dt><code>-mtune=&lt;name&gt;</code>
<dd>This specifies the name of the target ARM processor.  GCC uses this name
to determine what kind of instructions it can use when generating
assembly code.  Permissable names are: arm2, arm250, arm3, arm6, arm60,
arm600, arm610, arm620, arm7, arm7m, arm7d, arm7dm, arm7di, arm7dmi,
arm70, arm700, arm700i, arm710, arm710c, arm7100, arm7500, arm7500fe,
arm7tdmi, arm8, strongarm, strongarm110, strongarm1100, arm8, arm810,
arm9, arm9tdmi.  <code>-mtune=</code> is a synonym for <code>-mcpue=</code> to
support older versions of GCC.

<br><dt><code>-march=&lt;name&gt;</code>
<dd>This specifies the name of the target ARM architecture.  GCC uses this
name to determine what kind of instructions it can use when generating
assembly code.  This option can be used in conjunction with or instead
of the <code>-mcpu=</code> option.  Permissable names are: armv2, armv2a,
armv3, armv3m, armv4, armv4t

<br><dt><code>-mfpe=&lt;number&gt;</code>
<dt><code>-mfp=&lt;number&gt;</code>
<dd>This specifes the version of the floating point emulation available on
the target.  Permissable values are 2 and 3.  <code>-mfp=</code> is a synonym
for <code>-mfpe=</code> to support older versions of GCC.

<br><dt><code>-mstructure-size-boundary=&lt;n&gt;</code>
<dd>The size of all structures and unions will be rounded up to a multiple
of the number of bits set by this option.  Permissable values are 8 and
32.  The default value varies for different toolchains.  For the COFF
targeted toolchain the default value is 8.  Specifying the larger number
can produced faster, more efficient code, but can also increase the size
of the program.  The two values are potentially incompatible.  Code
compiled with one value cannot necessarily expect to work with code or
libraries compiled with the other value, if they exchange information
using structures or unions.  Programmers are encouraged to use the 32
value as future versions of the toolchain may default to this value.

<br><dt><code>-mabort-on-noreturn</code>
<dd>Generate a call to the function abort at the end of a noreturn function. 
It will be executed if the function tries to return.

<h3>Thumb Options</h3>

<dl>

<br><dt><code>-mthumb-interwork</code>
<dd>Generate code which supports calling between the THUMB and ARM
instruction sets.  Without this option the two instruction sets cannot
be reliably used inside one program.  The default is
<code>-mno-thumb-interwork</code>, since slightly smaller code is generated
with this option.

<br><dt><code>-mtpcs-frame</code>
<dd>Generate a stack frame that is compliant with the Thumb Procedure Call
Standard for all non-leaf functions.  (A leaf function is one that does
not call any other functions).  The default is <code>-mno-apcs-frame</code>.

<br><dt><code>-mtpcs-leaf-frame</code>
<dd>Generate a stack frame that is compliant with the Thumb Procedure Call
Standard for all leaf functions.  (A leaf function is one that does
not call any other functions).  The default is <code>-mno-apcs-leaf-frame</code>.

<br><dt><code>-mlittle-endian</code>

the default for all standard configurations.

<br><dt><code>-mbig-endian</code>
<dd>Generate code for a processor running in big-endian mode.

<h3>M32R/D Options</h3>

<p>These <code>-m</code> options are defined for Mitsubishi M32R/D architectures:

<dl>
<dt><code>-mcode-model=small</code>
<dd>Assume all objects live in the lower 16MB of memory (so that their addresses
can be loaded with the <code>ld24</code> instruction), and assume all subroutines
are reachable with the <code>bl</code> instruction. 
This is the default.

<p>The addressability of a particular object can be set with the
<code>model</code> attribute.

<br><dt><code>-mcode-model=medium</code>
<dd>Assume objects may be anywhere in the 32 bit address space (the compiler
will generate <code>seth/add3</code> instructions to load their addresses), and
assume all subroutines are reachable with the <code>bl</code> instruction.

<br><dt><code>-mcode-model=large</code>
<dd>Assume objects may be anywhere in the 32 bit address space (the compiler
will generate <code>seth/add3</code> instructions to load their addresses), and
assume subroutines may not be reachable with the <code>bl</code> instruction
(the compiler will generate the much slower <code>seth/add3/jl</code>
instruction sequence).

<br><dt><code>-msdata=none</code>
<dd>Disable use of the small data area.  Variables will be put into
one of <code>.data</code>, <code>bss</code>, or <code>.rodata</code> (unless the
<code>section</code> attribute has been specified). 
This is the default.

<p>The small data area consists of sections <code>.sdata</code> and <code>.sbss</code>. 
Objects may be explicitly put in the small data area with the
<code>section</code> attribute using one of these sections.

<br><dt><code>-msdata=sdata</code>
<dd>Put small global and static data in the small data area, but do not
generate special code to reference them.

<br><dt><code>-msdata=use</code>
<dd>Put small global and static data in the small data area, and generate
special instructions to reference them.

<br><dt><code>-G <var>num</var></code>
<dd>Put global and static objects less than or equal to <var>num</var> bytes
into the small data or bss sections instead of the normal data or bss
sections.  The default value of <var>num</var> is 8. 
The <code>-msdata</code> option must be set to one of <code>sdata</code> or <code>use</code>
for this option to have any effect.

<p>All modules should be compiled with the same <code>-G <var>num</var></code> value. 
Compiling with different values of <var>num</var> may or may not work; if it
doesn't the linker will give an error message - incorrect code will not be
generated.

<h3>M88K Options</h3>

<p>These <code>-m</code> options are defined for Motorola 88k architectures:

<dl>
<dt><code>-m88000</code>
<dd>Generate code that works well on both the m88100 and the
m88110.

<br><dt><code>-m88100</code>
<dd>Generate code that works best for the m88100, but that also
runs on the m88110.

<br><dt><code>-m88110</code>
<dd>Generate code that works best for the m88110, and may not run
on the m88100.

<br><dt><code>-mbig-pic</code>
<dd>Obsolete option to be removed from the next revision. 
Use <code>-fPIC</code>.

<br><dt><code>-midentify-revision</code>
<dd>Include an <code>ident</code> directive in the assembler output recording the
source file name, compiler name and version, timestamp, and compilation
flags used.

<br><dt><code>-mno-underscores</code>
<dd>In assembler output, emit symbol names without adding an underscore
character at the beginning of each name.  The default is to use an
underscore as prefix on each name.

<br><dt><code>-mocs-debug-info</code>
<dt><code>-mno-ocs-debug-info</code>
<dd>Include (or omit) additional debugging information (about registers used
in each stack frame) as specified in the 88open Object Compatibility
Standard, "OCS".  This extra information allows debugging of code that
has had the frame pointer eliminated.  The default for DG/UX, SVr4, and
Delta 88 SVr3.2 is to include this information; other 88k configurations
omit this information by default.

<br><dt><code>-mocs-frame-position</code>
<dd>When emitting COFF debugging information for automatic variables and
parameters stored on the stack, use the offset from the canonical frame
address, which is the stack pointer (register 31) on entry to the
function.  The DG/UX, SVr4, Delta88 SVr3.2, and BCS configurations use
<code>-mocs-frame-position</code>; other 88k configurations have the default
<code>-mno-ocs-frame-position</code>.

<br><dt><code>-mno-ocs-frame-position</code>
<dd>When emitting COFF debugging information for automatic variables and
parameters stored on the stack, use the offset from the frame pointer
register (register 30).  When this option is in effect, the frame
pointer is not eliminated when debugging information is selected by the
-g switch.

<br><dt><code>-moptimize-arg-area</code>
<dt><code>-mno-optimize-arg-area</code>
<dd>Control how function arguments are stored in stack frames. 
<code>-moptimize-arg-area</code> saves space by optimizing them, but this
conflicts with the 88open specifications.  The opposite alternative,
<code>-mno-optimize-arg-area</code>, agrees with 88open standards.  By default
GCC does not optimize the argument area.

<br><dt><code>-mshort-data-<var>num</var></code>
<dd>Generate smaller data references by making them relative to <code>r0</code>,
which allows loading a value using a single instruction (rather than the
usual two).  You control which data references are affected by
specifying <var>num</var> with this option.  For example, if you specify
<code>-mshort-data-512</code>, then the data references affected are those
involving displacements of less than 512 bytes. 
<code>-mshort-data-<var>num</var></code> is not effective for <var>num</var> greater
than 64k.

<br><dt><code>-mserialize-volatile</code>
<dt><code>-mno-serialize-volatile</code>
<dd>Do, or don't, generate code to guarantee sequential consistency
of volatile memory references.  By default, consistency is
guaranteed.

<p>The order of memory references made by the MC88110 processor does
not always match the order of the instructions requesting those
references.  In particular, a load instruction may execute before
a preceding store instruction.  Such reordering violates
sequential consistency of volatile memory references, when there
are multiple processors.   When consistency must be guaranteed,
GNU C generates special instructions, as needed, to force
execution in the proper order.

<p>The MC88100 processor does not reorder memory references and so
always provides sequential consistency.  However, by default, GNU
C generates the special instructions to guarantee consistency
even when you use <code>-m88100</code>, so that the code may be run on an
MC88110 processor.  If you intend to run your code only on the
MC88100 processor, you may use <code>-mno-serialize-volatile</code>.

<p>The extra code generated to guarantee consistency may affect the
performance of your application.  If you know that you can safely
forgo this guarantee, you may use <code>-mno-serialize-volatile</code>.

<br><dt><code>-msvr4</code>
<dt><code>-msvr3</code>
<dd>Turn on (<code>-msvr4</code>) or off (<code>-msvr3</code>) compiler extensions
related to System V release 4 (SVr4).  This controls the following:

<ol type=1 start=1>
</p><li>Which variant of the assembler syntax to emit. 
<li><code>-msvr4</code> makes the C preprocessor recognize <code>#pragma weak</code>
that is used on System V release 4. 
<li><code>-msvr4</code> makes GCC issue additional declaration directives used in
SVr4.
</ol>

<p><code>-msvr4</code> is the default for the m88k-motorola-sysv4 and
m88k-dg-dgux m88k configurations. <code>-msvr3</code> is the default for all
other m88k configurations.

<br><dt><code>-mversion-03.00</code>
<dd>This option is obsolete, and is ignored.

<br><dt><code>-mno-check-zero-division</code>
<dt><code>-mcheck-zero-division</code>
<dd>Do, or don't, generate code to guarantee that integer division by
zero will be detected.  By default, detection is guaranteed.

<p>Some models of the MC88100 processor fail to trap upon integer
division by zero under certain conditions.  By default, when
compiling code that might be run on such a processor, GNU C
generates code that explicitly checks for zero-valued divisors
and traps with exception number 503 when one is detected.  Use of
mno-check-zero-division suppresses such checking for code
generated to run on an MC88100 processor.

<p>GNU C assumes that the MC88110 processor correctly detects all
instances of integer division by zero.  When <code>-m88110</code> is
specified, both <code>-mcheck-zero-division</code> and
<code>-mno-check-zero-division</code> are ignored, and no explicit checks for
zero-valued divisors are generated.

<br><dt><code>-muse-div-instruction</code>
<dd>Use the div instruction for signed integer division on the
MC88100 processor.  By default, the div instruction is not used.

<p>On the MC88100 processor the signed integer division instruction
div) traps to the operating system on a negative operand.  The
operating system transparently completes the operation, but at a
large cost in execution time.  By default, when compiling code
that might be run on an MC88100 processor, GNU C emulates signed
integer division using the unsigned integer division instruction
divu), thereby avoiding the large penalty of a trap to the
operating system.  Such emulation has its own, smaller, execution
cost in both time and space.  To the extent that your code's
important signed integer division operations are performed on two
nonnegative operands, it may be desirable to use the div
instruction directly.

<p>On the MC88110 processor the div instruction (also known as the
divs instruction) processes negative operands without trapping to
the operating system.  When <code>-m88110</code> is specified,
<code>-muse-div-instruction</code> is ignored, and the div instruction is used
for signed integer division.

<p>Note that the result of dividing INT_MIN by -1 is undefined.  In
particular, the behavior of such a division with and without
<code>-muse-div-instruction</code>  may differ.

<br><dt><code>-mtrap-large-shift</code>
<dt><code>-mhandle-large-shift</code>
<dd>Include code to detect bit-shifts of more than 31 bits; respectively,
trap such shifts or emit code to handle them properly.  By default GCC
makes no special provision for large bit shifts.

<br><dt><code>-mwarn-passed-structs</code>
<dd>Warn when a function passes a struct as an argument or result. 
Structure-passing conventions have changed during the evolution of the C
language, and are often the source of portability problems.  By default,
GCC issues no such warning.

<h3>IBM RS/6000 and PowerPC Options</h3>

<p>These <code>-m</code> options are defined for the IBM RS/6000 and PowerPC:
<dl>
<dt><code>-mpower</code>
<dt><code>-mno-power</code>
<dt><code>-mpower2</code>
<dt><code>-mno-power2</code>
<dt><code>-mpowerpc</code>
<dt><code>-mno-powerpc</code>
<dt><code>-mpowerpc-gpopt</code>
<dt><code>-mno-powerpc-gpopt</code>
<dt><code>-mpowerpc-gfxopt</code>
<dt><code>-mno-powerpc-gfxopt</code>
<dt><code>-mpowerpc64</code>
<dt><code>-mno-powerpc64</code>
<dd>GCC supports two related instruction set architectures for the
RS/6000 and PowerPC.  The <dfn>POWER</dfn> instruction set are those
instructions supported by the <code>rios</code> chip set used in the original
RS/6000 systems and the <dfn>PowerPC</dfn> instruction set is the
architecture of the Motorola MPC5xx, MPC6xx, MPC8xx microprocessors, and
the IBM 4xx microprocessors.

<p>Neither architecture is a subset of the other.  However there is a
large common subset of instructions supported by both.  An MQ
register is included in processors supporting the POWER architecture.

<p>You use these options to specify which instructions are available on the
processor you are using.  The default value of these options is
determined when configuring GCC.  Specifying the
<code>-mcpu=<var>cpu_type</var></code> overrides the specification of these
options.  We recommend you use the <code>-mcpu=<var>cpu_type</var></code> option
rather than the options listed above.

<p>The <code>-mpower</code> option allows GCC to generate instructions that
are found only in the POWER architecture and to use the MQ register. 
Specifying <code>-mpower2</code> implies <code>-power</code> and also allows GCC
to generate instructions that are present in the POWER2 architecture but
not the original POWER architecture.

<p>The <code>-mpowerpc</code> option allows GCC to generate instructions that
are found only in the 32-bit subset of the PowerPC architecture. 
Specifying <code>-mpowerpc-gpopt</code> implies <code>-mpowerpc</code> and also allows
GCC to use the optional PowerPC architecture instructions in the
General Purpose group, including floating-point square root.  Specifying
<code>-mpowerpc-gfxopt</code> implies <code>-mpowerpc</code> and also allows GCC to
use the optional PowerPC architecture instructions in the Graphics
group, including floating-point select.

<p>The <code>-mpowerpc64</code> option allows GCC to generate the additional
64-bit instructions that are found in the full PowerPC64 architecture
and to treat GPRs as 64-bit, doubleword quantities.  GCC defaults to
<code>-mno-powerpc64</code>.

<p>If you specify both <code>-mno-power</code> and <code>-mno-powerpc</code>, GCC
will use only the instructions in the common subset of both
architectures plus some special AIX common-mode calls, and will not use
the MQ register.  Specifying both <code>-mpower</code> and <code>-mpowerpc</code>
permits GCC to use any instruction from either architecture and to
allow use of the MQ register; specify this for the Motorola MPC601.

<br><dt><code>-mnew-mnemonics</code>
<dt><code>-mold-mnemonics</code>
<dd>Select which mnemonics to use in the generated assembler code. 
<code>-mnew-mnemonics</code> requests output that uses the assembler mnemonics
defined for the PowerPC architecture, while <code>-mold-mnemonics</code>
requests the assembler mnemonics defined for the POWER architecture. 
Instructions defined in only one architecture have only one mnemonic;
GCC uses that mnemonic irrespective of which of these options is
specified.

<p>GCC defaults to the mnemonics appropriate for the architecture in
use.  Specifying <code>-mcpu=<var>cpu_type</var></code> sometimes overrides the
value of these option.  Unless you are building a cross-compiler, you
should normally not specify either <code>-mnew-mnemonics</code> or
<code>-mold-mnemonics</code>, but should instead accept the default.

<br><dt><code>-mcpu=<var>cpu_type</var></code>
<dd>Set architecture type, register usage, choice of mnemonics, and
instruction scheduling parameters for machine type <var>cpu_type</var>. 
Supported values for <var>cpu_type</var> are <code>rs6000</code>, <code>rios1</code>,
<code>rios2</code>, <code>rsc</code>, <code>601</code>, <code>602</code>, <code>603</code>,
<code>603e</code>, <code>604</code>, <code>604e</code>, <code>620</code>, <code>740</code>,
<code>750</code>, <code>power</code>, <code>power2</code>, <code>powerpc</code>, <code>403</code>,
<code>505</code>, <code>801</code>, <code>821</code>, <code>823</code>, and <code>860</code> and
<code>common</code>.  <code>-mcpu=power</code>, <code>-mcpu=power2</code>, and
<code>-mcpu=powerpc</code> specify generic POWER, POWER2 and pure PowerPC
(i.e., not MPC601) architecture machine types, with an appropriate,
generic processor model assumed for scheduling purposes.

<p>Specifying any of the following options:
<code>-mcpu=rios1</code>, <code>-mcpu=rios2</code>, <code>-mcpu=rsc</code>,
<code>-mcpu=power</code>, or <code>-mcpu=power2</code>
enables the <code>-mpower</code> option and disables the <code>-mpowerpc</code> option;
<code>-mcpu=601</code> enables both the <code>-mpower</code> and <code>-mpowerpc</code> options. 
All of <code>-mcpu=602</code>, <code>-mcpu=603</code>, <code>-mcpu=603e</code>,
<code>-mcpu=604</code>, <code>-mcpu=620</code>,
enable the <code>-mpowerpc</code> option and disable the <code>-mpower</code> option. 
Exactly similarly, all of <code>-mcpu=403</code>,
<code>-mcpu=505</code>, <code>-mcpu=821</code>, <code>-mcpu=860</code> and <code>-mcpu=powerpc</code>
enable the <code>-mpowerpc</code> option and disable the <code>-mpower</code> option. 
<code>-mcpu=common</code> disables both the
<code>-mpower</code> and <code>-mpowerpc</code> options.

<p>AIX versions 4 or greater selects <code>-mcpu=common</code> by default, so
that code will operate on all members of the RS/6000 and PowerPC
families.  In that case, GCC will use only the instructions in the
common subset of both architectures plus some special AIX common-mode
calls, and will not use the MQ register.  GCC assumes a generic
processor model for scheduling purposes.

<p>Specifying any of the options <code>-mcpu=rios1</code>, <code>-mcpu=rios2</code>,
<code>-mcpu=rsc</code>, <code>-mcpu=power</code>, or <code>-mcpu=power2</code> also
disables the <code>new-mnemonics</code> option.  Specifying <code>-mcpu=601</code>,
<code>-mcpu=602</code>, <code>-mcpu=603</code>, <code>-mcpu=603e</code>, <code>-mcpu=604</code>,
<code>620</code>, <code>403</code>, or <code>-mcpu=powerpc</code> also enables the
<code>new-mnemonics</code> option.

<p>Specifying <code>-mcpu=403</code>, <code>-mcpu=821</code>, or <code>-mcpu=860</code> also
enables the <code>-msoft-float</code> option.

<br><dt><code>-mtune=<var>cpu_type</var></code>
<dd>Set the instruction scheduling parameters for machine type
<var>cpu_type</var>, but do not set the architecture type, register usage,
choice of mnemonics like <code>-mcpu=</code><var>cpu_type</var> would.  The same
values for <var>cpu_type</var> are used for <code>-mtune=</code><var>cpu_type</var> as
for <code>-mcpu=</code><var>cpu_type</var>.  The <code>-mtune=</code><var>cpu_type</var>
option overrides the <code>-mcpu=</code><var>cpu_type</var> option in terms of
instruction scheduling parameters.

<br><dt><code>-mfull-toc</code>
<dt><code>-mno-fp-in-toc</code>
<dt><code>-mno-sum-in-toc</code>
<dt><code>-mminimal-toc</code>
<dd>Modify generation of the TOC (Table Of Contents), which is created for
every executable file.  The <code>-mfull-toc</code> option is selected by
default.  In that case, GCC will allocate at least one TOC entry for
each unique non-automatic variable reference in your program.  GCC
will also place floating-point constants in the TOC.  However, only
16,384 entries are available in the TOC.

<p>If you receive a linker error message that saying you have overflowed
the available TOC space, you can reduce the amount of TOC space used
with the <code>-mno-fp-in-toc</code> and <code>-mno-sum-in-toc</code> options. 
<code>-mno-fp-in-toc</code> prevents GCC from putting floating-point
constants in the TOC and <code>-mno-sum-in-toc</code> forces GCC to
generate code to calculate the sum of an address and a constant at
run-time instead of putting that sum into the TOC.  You may specify one
or both of these options.  Each causes GCC to produce very slightly
slower and larger code at the expense of conserving TOC space.

<p>If you still run out of space in the TOC even when you specify both of
these options, specify <code>-mminimal-toc</code> instead.  This option causes
GCC to make only one TOC entry for every file.  When you specify this
option, GCC will produce code that is slower and larger but which
uses extremely little TOC space.  You may wish to use this option
only on files that contain less frequently executed code.

<br><dt><code>-maix64</code>
<dt><code>-maix32</code>
<dd>Enable AIX 64-bit ABI and calling convention: 64-bit pointers, 64-bit
<code>long</code> type, and the infrastructure needed to support them. 
Specifying <code>-maix64</code> implies <code>-mpowerpc64</code> and
<code>-mpowerpc</code>, while <code>-maix32</code> disables the 64-bit ABI and
implies <code>-mno-powerpc64</code>.  GCC defaults to <code>-maix32</code>.

<br><dt><code>-mxl-call</code>
<dt><code>-mno-xl-call</code>
<dd>On AIX, pass floating-point arguments to prototyped functions beyond the
register save area (RSA) on the stack in addition to argument FPRs.  The
AIX calling convention was extended but not initially documented to
handle an obscure K&amp;R C case of calling a function that takes the
address of its arguments with fewer arguments than declared.  AIX XL
compilers access floating point arguments which do not fit in the
RSA from the stack when a subroutine is compiled without
optimization.  Because always storing floating-point arguments on the
stack is inefficient and rarely needed, this option is not enabled by
default and only is necessary when calling subroutines compiled by AIX
XL compilers without optimization.

<br><dt><code>-mthreads</code>
<dd>Support <dfn>AIX Threads</dfn>.  Link an application written to use
<dfn>pthreads</dfn> with special libraries and startup code to enable the
application to run.

<br><dt><code>-mpe</code>
<dd>Support <dfn>IBM RS/6000 SP</dfn> <dfn>Parallel Environment</dfn> (PE).  Link an
application written to use message passing with special startup code to
enable the application to run.  The system must have PE installed in the
standard location (<code>/usr/lpp/ppe.poe/</code>), or the <code>specs</code> file
must be overridden with the <code>-specs=</code> option to specify the
appropriate directory location.  The Parallel Environment does not
support threads, so the <code>-mpe</code> option and the <code>-mthreads</code>
option are incompatible.

<br><dt><code>-msoft-float</code>
<dt><code>-mhard-float</code>
<dd>Generate code that does not use (uses) the floating-point register set. 
Software floating point emulation is provided if you use the
<code>-msoft-float</code> option, and pass the option to GCC when linking.

<br><dt><code>-mmultiple</code>
<dt><code>-mno-multiple</code>
<dd>Generate code that uses (does not use) the load multiple word
instructions and the store multiple word instructions.  These
instructions are generated by default on POWER systems, and not
generated on PowerPC systems.  Do not use <code>-mmultiple</code> on little
endian PowerPC systems, since those instructions do not work when the
processor is in little endian mode.  The exceptions are PPC740 and
PPC750 which permit the instructions usage in little endian mode.

<br><dt><code>-mstring</code>
<dt><code>-mno-string</code>
<dd>Generate code that uses (does not use) the load string instructions
and the store string word instructions to save multiple registers and
do small block moves.  These instructions are generated by default on
POWER systems, and not generated on PowerPC systems.  Do not use
<code>-mstring</code> on little endian PowerPC systems, since those
instructions do not work when the processor is in little endian mode. 
The exceptions are PPC740 and PPC750 which permit the instructions
usage in little endian mode.

<br><dt><code>-mupdate</code>
<dt><code>-mno-update</code>
<dd>Generate code that uses (does not use) the load or store instructions
that update the base register to the address of the calculated memory
location.  These instructions are generated by default.  If you use
<code>-mno-update</code>, there is a small window between the time that the
stack pointer is updated and the address of the previous frame is
stored, which means code that walks the stack frame across interrupts or
signals may get corrupted data.

<br><dt><code>-mfused-madd</code>
<dt><code>-mno-fused-madd</code>
<dd>Generate code that uses (does not use) the floating point multiply and
accumulate instructions.  These instructions are generated by default if
hardware floating is used.

<br><dt><code>-mno-bit-align</code>
<dt><code>-mbit-align</code>
<dd>On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems do not (do) force structures
and unions that contain bit fields to be aligned to the base type of the
bit field.

<p>For example, by default a structure containing nothing but 8
<code>unsigned</code> bitfields of length 1 would be aligned to a 4 byte
boundary and have a size of 4 bytes.  By using <code>-mno-bit-align</code>,
the structure would be aligned to a 1 byte boundary and be one byte in
size.

<br><dt><code>-mno-strict-align</code>
<dt><code>-mstrict-align</code>
<dd>On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems do not (do) assume that
unaligned memory references will be handled by the system.

<br><dt><code>-mrelocatable</code>
<dt><code>-mno-relocatable</code>
<dd>On embedded PowerPC systems generate code that allows (does not allow)
the program to be relocated to a different address at runtime.  If you
use <code>-mrelocatable</code> on any module, all objects linked together must
be compiled with <code>-mrelocatable</code> or <code>-mrelocatable-lib</code>.

<br><dt><code>-mrelocatable-lib</code>
<dt><code>-mno-relocatable-lib</code>
<dd>On embedded PowerPC systems generate code that allows (does not allow)
the program to be relocated to a different address at runtime.  Modules
compiled with <code>-mrelocatable-lib</code> can be linked with either modules
compiled without <code>-mrelocatable</code> and <code>-mrelocatable-lib</code> or
with modules compiled with the <code>-mrelocatable</code> options.

<br><dt><code>-mno-toc</code>
<dt><code>-mtoc</code>
<dd>On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems do not (do) assume that
register 2 contains a pointer to a global area pointing to the addresses
used in the program.

<br><dt><code>-mlittle</code>
<dt><code>-mlittle-endian</code>
<dd>On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems compile code for the
processor in little endian mode.  The <code>-mlittle-endian</code> option is
the same as <code>-mlittle</code>.

<br><dt><code>-mbig</code>
<dt><code>-mbig-endian</code>
<dd>On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems compile code for the
processor in big endian mode.  The <code>-mbig-endian</code> option is
the same as <code>-mbig</code>.

<br><dt><code>-mcall-sysv</code>
<dd>On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems compile code using calling
conventions that adheres to the March 1995 draft of the System V
Application Binary Interface, PowerPC processor supplement.  This is the
default unless you configured GCC using <code>powerpc-*-eabiaix</code>.

<br><dt><code>-mcall-sysv-eabi</code>
<dd>Specify both <code>-mcall-sysv</code> and <code>-meabi</code> options.

<br><dt><code>-mcall-sysv-noeabi</code>
<dd>Specify both <code>-mcall-sysv</code> and <code>-mno-eabi</code> options.

<br><dt><code>-mcall-aix</code>
<dd>On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems compile code using calling
conventions that are similar to those used on AIX.  This is the
default if you configured GCC using <code>powerpc-*-eabiaix</code>.

<br><dt><code>-mcall-solaris</code>
<dd>On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems compile code for the Solaris
operating system.

<br><dt><code>-mcall-linux</code>
<dd>On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems compile code for the
Linux-based GNU system.

<br><dt><code>-mprototype</code>
<dt><code>-mno-prototype</code>
<dd>On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems assume that all calls to
variable argument functions are properly prototyped.  Otherwise, the
compiler must insert an instruction before every non prototyped call to
set or clear bit 6 of the condition code register (<var>CR</var>) to
indicate whether floating point values were passed in the floating point
registers in case the function takes a variable arguments.  With
<code>-mprototype</code>, only calls to prototyped variable argument functions
will set or clear the bit.

<br><dt><code>-msim</code>
<dd>On embedded PowerPC systems, assume that the startup module is called
<code>sim-crt0.o</code> and that the standard C libraries are <code>libsim.a</code> and
<code>libc.a</code>.  This is the default for <code>powerpc-*-eabisim</code>. 
configurations.

<br><dt><code>-mmvme</code>
<dd>On embedded PowerPC systems, assume that the startup module is called
<code>crt0.o</code> and the standard C libraries are <code>libmvme.a</code> and
<code>libc.a</code>.

<br><dt><code>-mads</code>
<dd>On embedded PowerPC systems, assume that the startup module is called
<code>crt0.o</code> and the standard C libraries are <code>libads.a</code> and
<code>libc.a</code>.

<br><dt><code>-myellowknife</code>
<dd>On embedded PowerPC systems, assume that the startup module is called
<code>crt0.o</code> and the standard C libraries are <code>libyk.a</code> and
<code>libc.a</code>.

<br><dt><code>-memb</code>
<dd>On embedded PowerPC systems, set the <var>PPC_EMB</var> bit in the ELF flags
header to indicate that <code>eabi</code> extended relocations are used.

<br><dt><code>-meabi</code>
<dt><code>-mno-eabi</code>
<dd>On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems do (do not) adhere to the
Embedded Applications Binary Interface (eabi) which is a set of
modifications to the System V.4 specifications.  Selecting <code>-meabi</code>
means that the stack is aligned to an 8 byte boundary, a function
<code>__eabi</code> is called to from <code>main</code> to set up the eabi
environment, and the <code>-msdata</code> option can use both <code>r2</code> and
<code>r13</code> to point to two separate small data areas.  Selecting
<code>-mno-eabi</code> means that the stack is aligned to a 16 byte boundary,
do not call an initialization function from <code>main</code>, and the
<code>-msdata</code> option will only use <code>r13</code> to point to a single
small data area.  The <code>-meabi</code> option is on by default if you
configured GCC using one of the <code>powerpc*-*-eabi*</code> options.

<br><dt><code>-msdata=eabi</code>
<dd>On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems, put small initialized
<code>const</code> global and static data in the <code>.sdata2</code> section, which
is pointed to by register <code>r2</code>.  Put small initialized
non-<code>const</code> global and static data in the <code>.sdata</code> section,
which is pointed to by register <code>r13</code>.  Put small uninitialized
global and static data in the <code>.sbss</code> section, which is adjacent to
the <code>.sdata</code> section.  The <code>-msdata=eabi</code> option is
incompatible with the <code>-mrelocatable</code> option.  The
<code>-msdata=eabi</code> option also sets the <code>-memb</code> option.

<br><dt><code>-msdata=sysv</code>
<dd>On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems, put small global and static
data in the <code>.sdata</code> section, which is pointed to by register
<code>r13</code>.  Put small uninitialized global and static data in the
<code>.sbss</code> section, which is adjacent to the <code>.sdata</code> section. 
The <code>-msdata=sysv</code> option is incompatible with the
<code>-mrelocatable</code> option.

<br><dt><code>-msdata=default</code>
<dt><code>-msdata</code>
<dd>On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems, if <code>-meabi</code> is used,
compile code the same as <code>-msdata=eabi</code>, otherwise compile code the
same as <code>-msdata=sysv</code>.

<br><dt><code>-msdata-data</code>
<dd>On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems, put small global and static
data in the <code>.sdata</code> section.  Put small uninitialized global and
static data in the <code>.sbss</code> section.  Do not use register <code>r13</code>
to address small data however.  This is the default behavior unless
other <code>-msdata</code> options are used.

<br><dt><code>-msdata=none</code>
<dt><code>-mno-sdata</code>
<dd>On embedded PowerPC systems, put all initialized global and static data
in the <code>.data</code> section, and all uninitialized data in the
<code>.bss</code> section.

<br><dt><code>-G <var>num</var></code>
<dd>On embedded PowerPC systems, put global and static items less than or
equal to <var>num</var> bytes into the small data or bss sections instead of
the normal data or bss section.  By default, <var>num</var> is 8.  The
<code>-G <var>num</var></code> switch is also passed to the linker. 
All modules should be compiled with the same <code>-G <var>num</var></code> value.

<br><dt><code>-mregnames</code>
<dt><code>-mno-regnames</code>
<dd>On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems do (do not) emit register
names in the assembly language output using symbolic forms.

<h3>IBM RT Options</h3>

<p>These <code>-m</code> options are defined for the IBM RT PC:

<dl>
<dt><code>-min-line-mul</code>
<dd>Use an in-line code sequence for integer multiplies.  This is the
default.

<br><dt><code>-mcall-lib-mul</code>
<dd>Call <code>lmul$$</code> for integer multiples.

<br><dt><code>-mfull-fp-blocks</code>
<dd>Generate full-size floating point data blocks, including the minimum
amount of scratch space recommended by IBM.  This is the default.

<br><dt><code>-mminimum-fp-blocks</code>
<dd>Do not include extra scratch space in floating point data blocks.  This
results in smaller code, but slower execution, since scratch space must
be allocated dynamically.

<br><dt><code>-mfp-arg-in-fpregs</code>
<dd>Use a calling sequence incompatible with the IBM calling convention in
which floating point arguments are passed in floating point registers. 
Note that <code>varargs.h</code> and <code>stdargs.h</code> will not work with
floating point operands if this option is specified.

<br><dt><code>-mfp-arg-in-gregs</code>
<dd>Use the normal calling convention for floating point arguments.  This is
the default.

<br><dt><code>-mhc-struct-return</code>
<dd>Return structures of more than one word in memory, rather than in a
register.  This provides compatibility with the MetaWare HighC (hc)
compiler.  Use the option <code>-fpcc-struct-return</code> for compatibility
with the Portable C Compiler (pcc).

<br><dt><code>-mnohc-struct-return</code>
<dd>Return some structures of more than one word in registers, when
convenient.  This is the default.  For compatibility with the
IBM-supplied compilers, use the option <code>-fpcc-struct-return</code> or the
option <code>-mhc-struct-return</code>.

<dd>Assume the defaults for the machine type <var>cpu type</var> when scheduling
instructions.  The choices for <var>cpu type</var> are <code>r2000</code>, <code>r3000</code>,
<code>r3900</code>, <code>r4000</code>, <code>r4100</code>, <code>r4300</code>, <code>r4400</code>,
<code>r4600</code>, <code>r4650</code>, <code>r5000</code>, <code>r6000</code>, <code>r8000</code>,
and <code>orion</code>.  Additionally, the <code>r2000</code>, <code>r3000</code>,
<code>r4000</code>, <code>r5000</code>, and <code>r6000</code> can be abbreviated as
<code>r2k</code> (or <code>r2K</code>), <code>r3k</code>, etc.  While picking a specific
<var>cpu type</var> will schedule things appropriately for that particular
chip, the compiler will not generate any code that does not meet level 1
of the MIPS ISA (instruction set architecture) without a <code>-mipsX</code>
or <code>-mabi</code> switch being used.

<br><dt><code>-mips1</code>
<dd>Issue instructions from level 1 of the MIPS ISA.  This is the default. 
<code>r3000</code> is the default <var>cpu type</var> at this ISA level.

<br><dt><code>-mips2</code>
<dd>Issue instructions from level 2 of the MIPS ISA (branch likely, square
root instructions).  <code>r6000</code> is the default <var>cpu type</var> at this
ISA level.

<br><dt><code>-mips3</code>
<dd>Issue instructions from level 3 of the MIPS ISA (64 bit instructions). 
<code>r4000</code> is the default <var>cpu type</var> at this ISA level.

<br><dt><code>-mips4</code>
<dd>Issue instructions from level 4 of the MIPS ISA (conditional move,
prefetch, enhanced FPU instructions).  <code>r8000</code> is the default
<var>cpu type</var> at this ISA level.

<br><dt><code>-mfp32</code>
<dd>Assume that 32 32-bit floating point registers are available.  This is
the default.

<br><dt><code>-mfp64</code>
<dd>Assume that 32 64-bit floating point registers are available.  This is
the default when the <code>-mips3</code> option is used.

<br><dt><code>-mgp32</code>
<dd>Assume that 32 32-bit general purpose registers are available.  This is
the default.

<br><dt><code>-mgp64</code>
<dd>Assume that 32 64-bit general purpose registers are available.  This is
the default when the <code>-mips3</code> option is used.

<br><dt><code>-mint64</code>
<dd>Force int and long types to be 64 bits wide.  See <code>-mlong32</code> for an
explanation of the default, and the width of pointers.

<br><dt><code>-mlong64</code>
<dd>Force long types to be 64 bits wide.  See <code>-mlong32</code> for an
explanation of the default, and the width of pointers.

<br><dt><code>-mlong32</code>
<dd>Force long, int, and pointer types to be 32 bits wide.

<p>If none of <code>-mlong32</code>, <code>-mlong64</code>, or <code>-mint64</code> are set,
the size of ints, longs, and pointers depends on the ABI and ISA choosen. 
For <code>-mabi=32</code>, and <code>-mabi=n32</code>, ints and longs are 32 bits
wide.  For <code>-mabi=64</code>, ints are 32 bits, and longs are 64 bits wide. 
For <code>-mabi=eabi</code> and either <code>-mips1</code> or <code>-mips2</code>, ints
and longs are 32 bits wide.  For <code>-mabi=eabi</code> and higher ISAs, ints
are 32 bits, and longs are 64 bits wide.  The width of pointer types is
the smaller of the width of longs or the width of general purpose
registers (which in turn depends on the ISA).

<br><dt><code>-mabi=32</code>
<dt><code>-mabi=o64</code>
<dt><code>-mabi=n32</code>
<dt><code>-mabi=64</code>
<dt><code>-mabi=eabi</code>
<dd>Generate code for the indicated ABI.  The default instruction level is
<code>-mips1</code> for <code>32</code>, <code>-mips3</code> for <code>n32</code>, and
<code>-mips4</code> otherwise.  Conversely, with <code>-mips1</code> or
<code>-mips2</code>, the default ABI is <code>32</code>; otherwise, the default ABI
is <code>64</code>.

<br><dt><code>-mmips-as</code>
<dd>Generate code for the MIPS assembler, and invoke <code>mips-tfile</code> to
add normal debug information.  This is the default for all
platforms except for the OSF/1 reference platform, using the OSF/rose
object format.  If the either of the <code>-gstabs</code> or <code>-gstabs+</code>
switches are used, the <code>mips-tfile</code> program will encapsulate the
stabs within MIPS ECOFF.

<br><dt><code>-mgas</code>
<dd>Generate code for the GNU assembler.  This is the default on the OSF/1
reference platform, using the OSF/rose object format.  Also, this is
the default if the configure option <code>--with-gnu-as</code> is used.

<br><dt><code>-msplit-addresses</code>
<dt><code>-mno-split-addresses</code>
<dd>Generate code to load the high and low parts of address constants separately. 
This allows <code>gcc</code> to optimize away redundant loads of the high order
bits of addresses.  This optimization requires GNU as and GNU ld. 
This optimization is enabled by default for some embedded targets where
GNU as and GNU ld are standard.

<br><dt><code>-mrnames</code>
<dt><code>-mno-rnames</code>
<dd>The <code>-mrnames</code> switch says to output code using the MIPS software
names for the registers, instead of the hardware names (ie, <var>a0</var>
instead of <var>$4</var>).  The only known assembler that supports this option
is the Algorithmics assembler.

<br><dt><code>-mgpopt</code>
<dt><code>-mno-gpopt</code>
<dd>The <code>-mgpopt</code> switch says to write all of the data declarations
before the instructions in the text section, this allows the MIPS
assembler to generate one word memory references instead of using two
words for short global or static data items.  This is on by default if
optimization is selected.

<br><dt><code>-mstats</code>
<dt><code>-mno-stats</code>
<dd>For each non-inline function processed, the <code>-mstats</code> switch
causes the compiler to emit one line to the standard error file to
print statistics about the program (number of registers saved, stack
size, etc.).

<br><dt><code>-mmemcpy</code>
<dt><code>-mno-memcpy</code>
<dd>The <code>-mmemcpy</code> switch makes all block moves call the appropriate
string function (<code>memcpy</code> or <code>bcopy</code>) instead of possibly
generating inline code.

<br><dt><code>-mmips-tfile</code>
<dt><code>-mno-mips-tfile</code>
<dd>The <code>-mno-mips-tfile</code> switch causes the compiler not
postprocess the object file with the <code>mips-tfile</code> program,
after the MIPS assembler has generated it to add debug support.  If
<code>mips-tfile</code> is not run, then no local variables will be
available to the debugger.  In addition, <code>stage2</code> and
<code>stage3</code> objects will have the temporary file names passed to the
assembler embedded in the object file, which means the objects will
not compare the same.  The <code>-mno-mips-tfile</code> switch should only
be used when there are bugs in the <code>mips-tfile</code> program that
prevents compilation.

<br><dt><code>-msoft-float</code>
<dd>Generate output containing library calls for floating point. 
<strong>Warning:</strong> the requisite libraries are not part of GCC. 
Normally the facilities of the machine's usual C compiler are used, but
this can't be done directly in cross-compilation.  You must make your
own arrangements to provide suitable library functions for
cross-compilation.

<br><dt><code>-mhard-float</code>
<dd>Generate output containing floating point instructions.  This is the
default if you use the unmodified sources.

<br><dt><code>-mabicalls</code>
<dt><code>-mno-abicalls</code>
<dd>Emit (or do not emit) the pseudo operations <code>.abicalls</code>,
<code>.cpload</code>, and <code>.cprestore</code> that some System V.4 ports use for
position independent code.

<br><dt><code>-mlong-calls</code>
<dt><code>-mno-long-calls</code>
<dd>Do all calls with the <code>JALR</code> instruction, which requires
loading up a function's address into a register before the call. 
You need to use this switch, if you call outside of the current
512 megabyte segment to functions that are not through pointers.

<br><dt><code>-mhalf-pic</code>
<dt><code>-mno-half-pic</code>
<dd>Put pointers to extern references into the data section and load them
up, rather than put the references in the text section.

<br><dt><code>-membedded-pic</code>
<dt><code>-mno-embedded-pic</code>
<dd>Generate PIC code suitable for some embedded systems.  All calls are
made using PC relative address, and all data is addressed using the $gp
register.  No more than 65536 bytes of global data may be used.  This
requires GNU as and GNU ld which do most of the work.  This currently
only works on targets which use ECOFF; it does not work with ELF.

<br><dt><code>-membedded-data</code>
<dt><code>-mno-embedded-data</code>
<dd>Allocate variables to the read-only data section first if possible, then
next in the small data section if possible, otherwise in data.  This gives
slightly slower code than the default, but reduces the amount of RAM required
when executing, and thus may be preferred for some embedded systems.

<br><dt><code>-msingle-float</code>
<dt><code>-mdouble-float</code>
<dd>The <code>-msingle-float</code> switch tells gcc to assume that the floating
point coprocessor only supports single precision operations, as on the
<code>r4650</code> chip.  The <code>-mdouble-float</code> switch permits gcc to use
double precision operations.  This is the default.

<br><dt><code>-mmad</code>
<dt><code>-mno-mad</code>
<dd>Permit use of the <code>mad</code>, <code>madu</code> and <code>mul</code> instructions,
as on the <code>r4650</code> chip.

<br><dt><code>-m4650</code>
<dd>Turns on <code>-msingle-float</code>, <code>-mmad</code>, and, at least for now,
<code>-mcpu=r4650</code>.

<br><dt><code>-mips16</code>
<dt><code>-mno-mips16</code>
<dd>Enable 16-bit instructions.

<br><dt><code>-mentry</code>
<dd>Use the entry and exit pseudo ops.  This option can only be used with
<code>-mips16</code>.

<br><dt><code>-EL</code>
<dd>Compile code for the processor in little endian mode. 
The requisite libraries are assumed to exist.

<br><dt><code>-EB</code>
<dd>Compile code for the processor in big endian mode. 
The requisite libraries are assumed to exist.

<br><dt><code>-G <var>num</var></code>
<dd>Put global and static items less than or equal to <var>num</var> bytes into
the small data or bss sections instead of the normal data or bss
section.  This allows the assembler to emit one word memory reference
instructions based on the global pointer (<var>gp</var> or <var>$28</var>),
instead of the normal two words used.  By default, <var>num</var> is 8 when
the MIPS assembler is used, and 0 when the GNU assembler is used.  The
<code>-G <var>num</var></code> switch is also passed to the assembler and linker. 
All modules should be compiled with the same <code>-G <var>num</var></code>
value.

<br><dt><code>-nocpp</code>
<dd>Tell the MIPS assembler to not run its preprocessor over user
assembler files (with a <code>.s</code> suffix) when assembling them. 
</dl>

<p>These options are defined by the macro
<code>TARGET_SWITCHES</code> in the machine description.  The default for the
options is also defined by that macro, which enables you to change the
defaults.

<h3>Intel 386 Options</h3>

<p>These <code>-m</code> options are defined for the i386 family of computers:

<dl>
<dt><code>-mcpu=<var>cpu type</var></code>
<dd>Assume the defaults for the machine type <var>cpu type</var> when scheduling
instructions.  The choices for <var>cpu type</var> are:

<p><table><tr align="left"><td><code>i386</code> <td><code>i486</code> <td><code>i586</code> <td><code>i686</code>
<br></tr><tr align="left"><td><code>pentium</code> <td><code>pentiumpro</code> <td><code>k6</code>
<br></tr></table>

<p>While picking a specific <var>cpu type</var> will schedule things appropriately
for that particular chip, the compiler will not generate any code that
does not run on the i386 without the <code>-march=<var>cpu type</var></code> option
being used.  <code>i586</code> is equivalent to <code>pentium</code> and <code>i686</code>
is equivalent to <code>pentiumpro</code>.  <code>k6</code> is the AMD chip as
opposed to the Intel ones.

<br><dt><code>-march=<var>cpu type</var></code>
<dd>Generate instructions for the machine type <var>cpu type</var>.  The choices
for <var>cpu type</var> are the same as for <code>-mcpu</code>.  Moreover,
specifying <code>-march=<var>cpu type</var></code> implies <code>-mcpu=<var>cpu type</var></code>.

<br><dt><code>-m386</code>
<dt><code>-m486</code>
<dt><code>-mpentium</code>
<dt><code>-mpentiumpro</code>
<dd>Synonyms for -mcpu=i386, -mcpu=i486, -mcpu=pentium, and -mcpu=pentiumpro
respectively.  These synonyms are deprecated.

<br><dt><code>-mieee-fp</code>
<dt><code>-mno-ieee-fp</code>
<dd>Control whether or not the compiler uses IEEE floating point
comparisons.  These handle correctly the case where the result of a
comparison is unordered.

<br><dt><code>-msoft-float</code>
<dd>Generate output containing library calls for floating point. 
<strong>Warning:</strong> the requisite libraries are not part of GCC. 
Normally the facilities of the machine's usual C compiler are used, but
this can't be done directly in cross-compilation.  You must make your
own arrangements to provide suitable library functions for
cross-compilation.

<p>On machines where a function returns floating point results in the 80387
register stack, some floating point opcodes may be emitted even if
<code>-msoft-float</code> is used.

<br><dt><code>-mno-fp-ret-in-387</code>
<dd>Do not use the FPU registers for return values of functions.

<p>The usual calling convention has functions return values of types
<code>float</code> and <code>double</code> in an FPU register, even if there
is no FPU.  The idea is that the operating system should emulate
an FPU.

<p>The option <code>-mno-fp-ret-in-387</code> causes such values to be returned
in ordinary CPU registers instead.

<br><dt><code>-mno-fancy-math-387</code>
<dd>Some 387 emulators do not support the <code>sin</code>, <code>cos</code> and
<code>sqrt</code> instructions for the 387.  Specify this option to avoid
generating those instructions. This option is the default on FreeBSD. 
As of revision 2.6.1, these instructions are not generated unless you
also use the <code>-ffast-math</code> switch.

<br><dt><code>-malign-double</code>
<dt><code>-mno-align-double</code>
<dd>Control whether GCC aligns <code>double</code>, <code>long double</code>, and
<code>long long</code> variables on a two word boundary or a one word
boundary.  Aligning <code>double</code> variables on a two word boundary will
produce code that runs somewhat faster on a <code>Pentium</code> at the
expense of more memory.

<p><strong>Warning:</strong> if you use the <code>-malign-double</code> switch,
structures containing the above types will be aligned differently than
the published application binary interface specifications for the 386.

<br><dt><code>-msvr3-shlib</code>
<dt><code>-mno-svr3-shlib</code>
<dd>Control whether GCC places uninitialized locals into <code>bss</code> or
<code>data</code>.  <code>-msvr3-shlib</code> places these locals into <code>bss</code>. 
These options are meaningful only on System V Release 3.

<br><dt><code>-mno-wide-multiply</code>
<dt><code>-mwide-multiply</code>
<dd>Control whether GCC uses the <code>mul</code> and <code>imul</code> that produce
64 bit results in <code>eax:edx</code> from 32 bit operands to do <code>long
long</code> multiplies and 32-bit division by constants.

<br><dt><code>-mrtd</code>
<dd>Use a different function-calling convention, in which functions that
take a fixed number of arguments return with the <code>ret</code> <var>num</var>
instruction, which pops their arguments while returning.  This saves one
instruction in the caller since there is no need to pop the arguments
there.

<p>You can specify that an individual function is called with this calling
sequence with the function attribute <code>stdcall</code>.  You can also
override the <code>-mrtd</code> option by using the function attribute
<code>cdecl</code>.  See <a href="#Function%20Attributes">Function Attributes</a>.

<p><strong>Warning:</strong> this calling convention is incompatible with the one
normally used on Unix, so you cannot use it if you need to call
libraries compiled with the Unix compiler.

<p>Also, you must provide function prototypes for all functions that
take variable numbers of arguments (including <code>printf</code>);
otherwise incorrect code will be generated for calls to those
functions.

<p>In addition, seriously incorrect code will result if you call a
function with too many arguments.  (Normally, extra arguments are
harmlessly ignored.)

<br><dt><code>-mreg-alloc=<var>regs</var></code>
<dd>Control the default allocation order of integer registers.  The
string <var>regs</var> is a series of letters specifying a register.  The
supported letters are: <code>a</code> allocate EAX; <code>b</code> allocate EBX;
<code>c</code> allocate ECX; <code>d</code> allocate EDX; <code>S</code> allocate ESI;
<code>D</code> allocate EDI; <code>B</code> allocate EBP.

<br><dt><code>-mregparm=<var>num</var></code>
<dd>Control how many registers are used to pass integer arguments.  By
default, no registers are used to pass arguments, and at most 3
registers can be used.  You can control this behavior for a specific
function by using the function attribute <code>regparm</code>. 
See <a href="#Function%20Attributes">Function Attributes</a>.

<p><strong>Warning:</strong> if you use this switch, and
<var>num</var> is nonzero, then you must build all modules with the same
value, including any libraries.  This includes the system libraries and
startup modules.

<br><dt><code>-malign-loops=<var>num</var></code>
<dd>Align loops to a 2 raised to a <var>num</var> byte boundary.  If
<code>-malign-loops</code> is not specified, the default is 2 unless
gas 2.8 (or later) is being used in which case the default is
to align the loop on a 16 byte boundary if it is less than 8
bytes away.

<br><dt><code>-malign-jumps=<var>num</var></code>
<dd>Align instructions that are only jumped to to a 2 raised to a <var>num</var>
byte boundary.  If <code>-malign-jumps</code> is not specified, the default is
2 if optimizing for a 386, and 4 if optimizing for a 486 unless
gas 2.8 (or later) is being used in which case the default is
to align the instruction on a 16 byte boundary if it is less
than 8 bytes away.

<br><dt><code>-malign-functions=<var>num</var></code>
<dd>Align the start of functions to a 2 raised to <var>num</var> byte boundary. 
If <code>-malign-functions</code> is not specified, the default is 2 if optimizing
for a 386, and 4 if optimizing for a 486.

<br><dt><code>-mpreferred-stack-boundary=<var>num</var></code>
<dd>Attempt to keep the stack boundary aligned to a 2 raised to <var>num</var>
byte boundary.  If <code>-mpreferred-stack-boundary</code> is not specified,
the default is 4 (16 bytes or 128 bits).

<p>The stack is required to be aligned on a 4 byte boundary.  On Pentium
and PentiumPro, <code>double</code> and <code>long double</code> values should be
aligned to an 8 byte boundary (see <code>-malign-double</code>) or suffer
significant run time performance penalties.  On Pentium III, the
Streaming SIMD Extention (SSE) data type <code>__m128</code> suffers similar
penalties if it is not 16 byte aligned.

<p>To ensure proper alignment of this values on the stack, the stack boundary
must be as aligned as that required by any value stored on the stack. 
Further, every function must be generated such that it keeps the stack
aligned.  Thus calling a function compiled with a higher preferred
stack boundary from a function compiled with a lower preferred stack
boundary will most likely misalign the stack.  It is recommended that
libraries that use callbacks always use the default setting.

<p>This extra alignment does consume extra stack space.  Code that is sensitive
to stack space usage, such as embedded systems and operating system kernels,
may want to reduce the preferred alignment to
<code>-mpreferred-stack-boundary=2</code>.

<br><dt><code>-mthreads</code>
<dd>Support thread-safe exception handling on <code>Mingw32</code>. Code that relies
on thread-safe exception handling must compile and link all code with the
<code>-mthreads</code> option. When compiling, <code>-mthreads</code> defines
<code>-D_MT</code>; when linking, it links in a special thread helper library
<code>-lmingwthrd</code> which cleans up per thread exception handling data.

<h3>HPPA Options</h3>

<p>These <code>-m</code> options are defined for the HPPA family of computers:

<dl>
<dt><code>-march=<var>architecture type</var></code>
<dd>Generate code for the specified architecture.  The choices for
<var>architecture type</var> are <code>1.0</code> for PA 1.0, <code>1.1</code> for PA
1.1, and <code>2.0</code> for PA 2.0 processors.  Refer to
<code>/usr/lib/sched.models</code> on an HP-UX system to determine the proper
architecture option for your machine.  Code compiled for lower numbered
architectures will run on higher numbered architectures, but not the
other way around.

<p>PA 2.0 support currently requires gas snapshot 19990413 or later.  The
next release of binutils (current is 2.9.1) will probably contain PA 2.0
support.

<br><dt><code>-mpa-risc-1-0</code>
<dt><code>-mpa-risc-1-1</code>
<dt><code>-mpa-risc-2-0</code>
<dd>Synonyms for -march=1.0, -march=1.1, and -march=2.0 respectively.

<br><dt><code>-mbig-switch</code>
<dd>Generate code suitable for big switch tables.  Use this option only if
the assembler/linker complain about out of range branches within a switch
table.

<br><dt><code>-mjump-in-delay</code>
<dd>Fill delay slots of function calls with unconditional jump instructions
by modifying the return pointer for the function call to be the target
of the conditional jump.

<br><dt><code>-mdisable-fpregs</code>
<dd>Prevent floating point registers from being used in any manner.  This is
necessary for compiling kernels which perform lazy context switching of
floating point registers.  If you use this option and attempt to perform
floating point operations, the compiler will abort.

<br><dt><code>-mdisable-indexing</code>
<dd>Prevent the compiler from using indexing address modes.  This avoids some
rather obscure problems when compiling MIG generated code under MACH.

<br><dt><code>-mno-space-regs</code>
<dd>Generate code that assumes the target has no space registers.  This allows
GCC to generate faster indirect calls and use unscaled index address modes.

<p>Such code is suitable for level 0 PA systems and kernels.

<br><dt><code>-mfast-indirect-calls</code>
<dd>Generate code that assumes calls never cross space boundaries.  This
allows GCC to emit code which performs faster indirect calls.

<p>This option will not work in the presense of shared libraries or nested
functions.

<br><dt><code>-mspace</code>
<dd>Optimize for space rather than execution time.  Currently this only
enables out of line function prologues and epilogues.  This option is
incompatible with PIC code generation and profiling.

<br><dt><code>-mlong-load-store</code>
<dd>Generate 3-instruction load and store sequences as sometimes required by
the HP-UX 10 linker.  This is equivalent to the <code>+k</code> option to
the HP compilers.

<br><dt><code>-mportable-runtime</code>
<dd>Use the portable calling conventions proposed by HP for ELF systems.

<br><dt><code>-mgas</code>
<dd>Enable the use of assembler directives only GAS understands.

<br><dt><code>-mschedule=<var>cpu type</var></code>
<dd>Schedule code according to the constraints for the machine type
<var>cpu type</var>.  The choices for <var>cpu type</var> are <code>700</code>
<code>7100</code>, <code>7100LC</code>, <code>7200</code>, and <code>8000</code>.  Refer to
<code>/usr/lib/sched.models</code> on an HP-UX system to determine the
proper scheduling option for your machine.

<br><dt><code>-mlinker-opt</code>
<dd>Enable the optimization pass in the HPUX linker.  Note this makes symbolic
debugging impossible.  It also triggers a bug in the HPUX 8 and HPUX 9 linkers
in which they give bogus error messages when linking some programs.

<br><dt><code>-msoft-float</code>
<dd>Generate output containing library calls for floating point. 
<strong>Warning:</strong> the requisite libraries are not available for all HPPA
targets.  Normally the facilities of the machine's usual C compiler are
used, but this cannot be done directly in cross-compilation.  You must make
your own arrangements to provide suitable library functions for
cross-compilation.  The embedded target <code>hppa1.1-*-pro</code>
does provide software floating point support.

<p><code>-msoft-float</code> changes the calling convention in the output file;
therefore, it is only useful if you compile <em>all</em> of a program with
this option.  In particular, you need to compile <code>libgcc.a</code>, the
library that comes with GCC, with <code>-msoft-float</code> in order for
this to work.

<h3>Intel 960 Options</h3>

<p>These <code>-m</code> options are defined for the Intel 960 implementations:

<dl>
<dt><code>-m<var>cpu type</var></code>
<dd>Assume the defaults for the machine type <var>cpu type</var> for some of
the other options, including instruction scheduling, floating point
support, and addressing modes.  The choices for <var>cpu type</var> are
<code>ka</code>, <code>kb</code>, <code>mc</code>, <code>ca</code>, <code>cf</code>,
<code>sa</code>, and <code>sb</code>. 
The default is
<code>kb</code>.

<br><dt><code>-mnumerics</code>
<dt><code>-msoft-float</code>
<dd>The <code>-mnumerics</code> option indicates that the processor does support
floating-point instructions.  The <code>-msoft-float</code> option indicates
that floating-point support should not be assumed.

<br><dt><code>-mleaf-procedures</code>
<dt><code>-mno-leaf-procedures</code>
<dd>Do (or do not) attempt to alter leaf procedures to be callable with the
<code>bal</code> instruction as well as <code>call</code>.  This will result in more
efficient code for explicit calls when the <code>bal</code> instruction can be
substituted by the assembler or linker, but less efficient code in other
cases, such as calls via function pointers, or using a linker that doesn't
support this optimization.

<br><dt><code>-mtail-call</code>
<dt><code>-mno-tail-call</code>
<dd>Do (or do not) make additional attempts (beyond those of the
machine-independent portions of the compiler) to optimize tail-recursive
calls into branches.  You may not want to do this because the detection of
cases where this is not valid is not totally complete.  The default is
<code>-mno-tail-call</code>.

<br><dt><code>-mcomplex-addr</code>
<dt><code>-mno-complex-addr</code>
<dd>Assume (or do not assume) that the use of a complex addressing mode is a
win on this implementation of the i960.  Complex addressing modes may not
be worthwhile on the K-series, but they definitely are on the C-series. 
The default is currently <code>-mcomplex-addr</code> for all processors except
the CB and CC.

<br><dt><code>-mcode-align</code>
<dt><code>-mno-code-align</code>
<dd>Align code to 8-byte boundaries for faster fetching (or don't bother). 
Currently turned on by default for C-series implementations only.

<br><dt><code>-mic-compat</code>
<dt><code>-mic2.0-compat</code>
<dt><code>-mic3.0-compat</code>
<dd>Enable compatibility with iC960 v2.0 or v3.0.

<br><dt><code>-masm-compat</code>
<dt><code>-mintel-asm</code>
<dd>Enable compatibility with the iC960 assembler.

<br><dt><code>-mstrict-align</code>
<dt><code>-mno-strict-align</code>
<dd>Do not permit (do permit) unaligned accesses.

<br><dt><code>-mold-align</code>
<dd>Enable structure-alignment compatibility with Intel's gcc release version
1.3 (based on gcc 1.37).  This option implies <code>-mstrict-align</code>.

<br><dt><code>-mlong-double-64</code>
<dd>Implement type <code>long double</code> as 64-bit floating point numbers. 
Without the option <code>long double</code> is implemented by 80-bit
floating point numbers.  The only reason we have it because there is
no 128-bit <code>long double</code> support in <code>fp-bit.c</code> yet.  So it
is only useful for people using soft-float targets.  Otherwise, we
should recommend against use of it.

<h3>DEC Alpha Options</h3>

<p>These <code>-m</code> options are defined for the DEC Alpha implementations:

<dl>
<dt><code>-mno-soft-float</code>
<dt><code>-msoft-float</code>
<dd>Use (do not use) the hardware floating-point instructions for
floating-point operations.  When <code>-msoft-float</code> is specified,
functions in <code>libgcc1.c</code> will be used to perform floating-point
operations.  Unless they are replaced by routines that emulate the
floating-point operations, or compiled in such a way as to call such
emulations routines, these routines will issue floating-point
operations.   If you are compiling for an Alpha without floating-point
operations, you must ensure that the library is built so as not to call
them.

<p>Note that Alpha implementations without floating-point operations are
required to have floating-point registers.

<br><dt><code>-mfp-reg</code>
<dt><code>-mno-fp-regs</code>
<dd>Generate code that uses (does not use) the floating-point register set. 
<code>-mno-fp-regs</code> implies <code>-msoft-float</code>.  If the floating-point
register set is not used, floating point operands are passed in integer
registers as if they were integers and floating-point results are passed
in $0 instead of $f0.  This is a non-standard calling sequence, so any
function with a floating-point argument or return value called by code
compiled with <code>-mno-fp-regs</code> must also be compiled with that
option.

<p>A typical use of this option is building a kernel that does not use,
and hence need not save and restore, any floating-point registers.

<br><dt><code>-mieee</code>
<dd>The Alpha architecture implements floating-point hardware optimized for
maximum performance.  It is mostly compliant with the IEEE floating
point standard.  However, for full compliance, software assistance is
required.  This option generates code fully IEEE compliant code
<em>except</em> that the <var>inexact flag</var> is not maintained (see below). 
If this option is turned on, the CPP macro <code>_IEEE_FP</code> is defined
during compilation.  The option is a shorthand for: <code>-D_IEEE_FP
-mfp-trap-mode=su -mtrap-precision=i -mieee-conformant</code>.  The resulting
code is less efficient but is able to correctly support denormalized
numbers and exceptional IEEE values such as not-a-number and plus/minus
infinity.  Other Alpha compilers call this option
<code>-ieee_with_no_inexact</code>.

<br><dt><code>-mieee-with-inexact</code>
<dd>This is like <code>-mieee</code> except the generated code also maintains the
IEEE <var>inexact flag</var>.  Turning on this option causes the generated
code to implement fully-compliant IEEE math.  The option is a shorthand
for <code>-D_IEEE_FP -D_IEEE_FP_INEXACT</code> plus the three following:
<code>-mieee-conformant</code>,
<code>-mfp-trap-mode=sui</code>,
and <code>-mtrap-precision=i</code>. 
On some Alpha implementations the resulting code may execute
significantly slower than the code generated by default.  Since there
is very little code that depends on the <var>inexact flag</var>, you should
normally not specify this option.  Other Alpha compilers call this
option <code>-ieee_with_inexact</code>.

<br><dt><code>-mfp-trap-mode=<var>trap mode</var></code>
<dd>This option controls what floating-point related traps are enabled. 
Other Alpha compilers call this option <code>-fptm </code><var>trap mode</var>. 
The trap mode can be set to one of four values:

<dl>
<dt><code>n</code>
<dd>This is the default (normal) setting.  The only traps that are enabled
are the ones that cannot be disabled in software (e.g., division by zero
trap).

<br><dt><code>u</code>
<dd>In addition to the traps enabled by <code>n</code>, underflow traps are enabled
as well.

<br><dt><code>su</code>
<dd>Like <code>su</code>, but the instructions are marked to be safe for software
completion (see Alpha architecture manual for details).

<br><dt><code>sui</code>
<dd>Like <code>su</code>, but inexact traps are enabled as well. 
</dl>

<br><dt><code>-mfp-rounding-mode=<var>rounding mode</var></code>
<dd>Selects the IEEE rounding mode.  Other Alpha compilers call this option
<code>-fprm </code><var>rounding mode</var>.  The <var>rounding mode</var> can be one
of:

<dl>
<dt><code>n</code>
<dd>Normal IEEE rounding mode.  Floating point numbers are rounded towards
the nearest machine number or towards the even machine number in case
of a tie.

<br><dt><code>m</code>
<dd>Round towards minus infinity.

<br><dt><code>c</code>
<dd>Chopped rounding mode.  Floating point numbers are rounded towards zero.

<br><dt><code>d</code>
<dd>Dynamic rounding mode.  A field in the floating point control register
(<var>fpcr</var>, see Alpha architecture reference manual) controls the
rounding mode in effect.  The C library initializes this register for
rounding towards plus infinity.  Thus, unless your program modifies the
<var>fpcr</var>, <code>d</code> corresponds to round towards plus infinity. 
</dl>

<br><dt><code>-mtrap-precision=<var>trap precision</var></code>
<dd>In the Alpha architecture, floating point traps are imprecise.  This
means without software assistance it is impossible to recover from a
floating trap and program execution normally needs to be terminated. 
GCC can generate code that can assist operating system trap handlers
in determining the exact location that caused a floating point trap. 
Depending on the requirements of an application, different levels of
precisions can be selected:

<dl>
<dt><code>p</code>
<dd>Program precision.  This option is the default and means a trap handler
can only identify which program caused a floating point exception.

<br><dt><code>f</code>
<dd>Function precision.  The trap handler can determine the function that
caused a floating point exception.

<br><dt><code>i</code>
<dd>Instruction precision.  The trap handler can determine the exact
instruction that caused a floating point exception. 
</dl>

<p>Other Alpha compilers provide the equivalent options called
<code>-scope_safe</code> and <code>-resumption_safe</code>.

<br><dt><code>-mieee-conformant</code>
<dd>This option marks the generated code as IEEE conformant.  You must not
use this option unless you also specify <code>-mtrap-precision=i</code> and either
<code>-mfp-trap-mode=su</code> or <code>-mfp-trap-mode=sui</code>.  Its only effect
is to emit the line <code>.eflag 48</code> in the function prologue of the
generated assembly file.  Under DEC Unix, this has the effect that
IEEE-conformant math library routines will be linked in.

<br><dt><code>-mbuild-constants</code>
<dd>Normally GCC examines a 32- or 64-bit integer constant to
see if it can construct it from smaller constants in two or three
instructions.  If it cannot, it will output the constant as a literal and
generate code to load it from the data segment at runtime.

<p>Use this option to require GCC to construct <em>all</em> integer constants
using code, even if it takes more instructions (the maximum is six).

<p>You would typically use this option to build a shared library dynamic
loader.  Itself a shared library, it must relocate itself in memory
before it can find the variables and constants in its own data segment.

<br><dt><code>-malpha-as</code>
<dt><code>-mgas</code>
<dd>Select whether to generate code to be assembled by the vendor-supplied
assembler (<code>-malpha-as</code>) or by the GNU assembler <code>-mgas</code>.

<br><dt><code>-mbwx</code>
<dt><code>-mno-bwx</code>
<dt><code>-mcix</code>
<dt><code>-mno-cix</code>
<dt><code>-mmax</code>
<dt><code>-mno-max</code>
<dd>Indicate whether GCC should generate code to use the optional BWX,
CIX, and MAX instruction sets.  The default is to use the instruction sets
supported by the CPU type specified via <code>-mcpu=</code> option or that
of the CPU on which GCC was built if none was specified.

<br><dt><code>-mcpu=<var>cpu_type</var></code>
<dd>Set the instruction set, register set, and instruction scheduling
parameters for machine type <var>cpu_type</var>.  You can specify either the
<code>EV</code> style name or the corresponding chip number.  GCC
supports scheduling parameters for the EV4 and EV5 family of processors
and will choose the default values for the instruction set from
the processor you specify.  If you do not specify a processor type,
GCC will default to the processor on which the compiler was built.

<p>Supported values for <var>cpu_type</var> are

<dl>
<dt><code>ev4</code>
<dt><code>21064</code>
<dd>Schedules as an EV4 and has no instruction set extensions.

<br><dt><code>ev5</code>
<dt><code>21164</code>
<dd>Schedules as an EV5 and has no instruction set extensions.

<br><dt><code>ev56</code>
<dt><code>21164a</code>
<dd>Schedules as an EV5 and supports the BWX extension.

<br><dt><code>pca56</code>
<dt><code>21164pc</code>
<dt><code>21164PC</code>
<dd>Schedules as an EV5 and supports the BWX and MAX extensions.

<br><dt><code>ev6</code>
<dt><code>21264</code>
<dd>Schedules as an EV5 (until Digital releases the scheduling parameters
for the EV6) and supports the BWX, CIX, and MAX extensions. 
</dl>

<br><dt><code>-mmemory-latency=<var>time</var></code>
<dd>Sets the latency the scheduler should assume for typical memory
references as seen by the application.  This number is highly
dependant on the memory access patterns used by the application
and the size of the external cache on the machine.

<p>Valid options for <var>time</var> are

<dl>
<dt><code><var>number</var></code>
<dd>A decimal number representing clock cycles.

<br><dt><code>L1</code>
<dt><code>L2</code>
<dt><code>L3</code>
<dt><code>main</code>
<dd>The compiler contains estimates of the number of clock cycles for
"typical" EV4 &amp; EV5 hardware for the Level 1, 2 &amp; 3 caches
(also called Dcache, Scache, and Bcache), as well as to main memory. 
Note that L3 is only valid for EV5.

<h3>TMS320C3x/C4x Options</h3>

<p>These <code>-m</code> options are defined for TMS320C3x/C4x implementations:

<dl>

<br><dt><code>-mcpu=<var>cpu_type</var></code>
<dd>Set the instruction set, register set, and instruction scheduling
parameters for machine type <var>cpu_type</var>.  Supported values for
<var>cpu_type</var> are <code>c30</code>, <code>c31</code>, <code>c32</code>, <code>c40</code>, and
<code>c44</code>.  The default is <code>c40</code> to generate code for the
TMS320C40.

<br><dt><code>-mbig-memory</code>
<br><dt><code>-mbig</code>
<dt><code>-msmall-memory</code>
<dt><code>-msmall</code>
<dd>Generates code for the big or small memory model.  The small memory
model assumed that all data fits into one 64K word page.  At run-time
the data page (DP) register must be set to point to the 64K page
containing the .bss and .data program sections.  The big memory model is
the default and requires reloading of the DP register for every direct
memory access.

<br><dt><code>-mbk</code>
<dt><code>-mno-bk</code>
<dd>Allow (disallow) allocation of general integer operands into the block
count register BK.

<br><dt><code>-mdb</code>
<dt><code>-mno-db</code>
<dd>Enable (disable) generation of code using decrement and branch,
DBcond(D), instructions.  This is enabled by default for the C4x.  To be
on the safe side, this is disabled for the C3x, since the maximum
iteration count on the C3x is 2^23 + 1 (but who iterates loops more than
2^23 times on the C3x?).  Note that GCC will try to reverse a loop so
that it can utilise the decrement and branch instruction, but will give
up if there is more than one memory reference in the loop.  Thus a loop
where the loop counter is decremented can generate slightly more
efficient code, in cases where the RPTB instruction cannot be utilised.

<br><dt><code>-mdp-isr-reload</code>
<dt><code>-mparanoid</code>
<dd>Force the DP register to be saved on entry to an interrupt service
routine (ISR), reloaded to point to the data section, and restored on
exit from the ISR.  This should not be required unless someone has
violated the small memory model by modifying the DP register, say within
an object library.

<br><dt><code>-mmpyi</code>
<dt><code>-mno-mpyi</code>
<dd>For the C3x use the 24-bit MPYI instruction for integer multiplies
instead of a library call to guarantee 32-bit results.  Note that if one
of the operands is a constant, then the multiplication will be performed
using shifts and adds.  If the -mmpyi option is not specified for the C3x,
then squaring operations are performed inline instead of a library call.

<br><dt><code>-mfast-fix</code>
<dt><code>-mno-fast-fix</code>
<dd>The C3x/C4x FIX instruction to convert a floating point value to an
integer value chooses the nearest integer less than or equal to the
floating point value rather than to the nearest integer.  Thus if the
floating point number is negative, the result will be incorrectly
truncated an additional code is necessary to detect and correct this
case.  This option can be used to disable generation of the additional
code required to correct the result.

<br><dt><code>-mrptb</code>
<dt><code>-mno-rptb</code>
<dd>Enable (disable) generation of repeat block sequences using the RPTB
instruction for zero overhead looping.  The RPTB construct is only used
for innermost loops that do not call functions or jump across the loop
boundaries.  There is no advantage having nested RPTB loops due to the
overhead required to save and restore the RC, RS, and RE registers. 
This is enabled by default with -O2.

<br><dt><code>-mrpts=<var>count</var></code>
<dt><code>-mno-rpts</code>
<dd>Enable (disable) the use of the single instruction repeat instruction
RPTS.  If a repeat block contains a single instruction, and the loop
count can be guaranteed to be less than the value <var>count</var>, GCC will
emit a RPTS instruction instead of a RPTB.  If no value is specified,
then a RPTS will be emitted even if the loop count cannot be determined
at compile time.  Note that the repeated instruction following RPTS does
not have to be reloaded from memory each iteration, thus freeing up the
CPU buses for oeprands.  However, since interrupts are blocked by this
instruction, it is disabled by default.

<br><dt><code>-mloop-unsigned</code>
<dt><code>-mno-loop-unsigned</code>
<dd>The maximum iteration count when using RPTS and RPTB (and DB on the C40)
is 2^31 + 1 since these instructions test if the iteration count is
negative to terminate the loop.  If the iteration count is unsigned
there is a possibility than the 2^31 + 1 maximum iteration count may be
exceeded.  This switch allows an unsigned iteration count.

<br><dt><code>-mti</code>
<dd>Try to emit an assembler syntax that the TI assembler (asm30) is happy
with.  This also enforces compatibility with the API employed by the TI
C3x C compiler.  For example, long doubles are passed as structures
rather than in floating point registers.

<br><dt><code>-mregparm</code>
<dt><code>-mmemparm</code>
<dd>Generate code that uses registers (stack) for passing arguments to functions. 
By default, arguments are passed in registers where possible rather
than by pushing arguments on to the stack.

<br><dt><code>-mparallel-insns</code>
<dt><code>-mno-parallel-insns</code>
<dd>Allow the generation of parallel instructions.  This is enabled by
default with -O2.

<br><dt><code>-mparallel-mpy</code>
<dt><code>-mno-parallel-mpy</code>
<dd>Allow the generation of MPY||ADD and MPY||SUB parallel instructions,
provided -mparallel-insns is also specified.  These instructions have
tight register constraints which can pessimize the code generation
of large functions.

<h3>V850 Options</h3>

<dl>
<dt><code>-mlong-calls</code>
<dt><code>-mno-long-calls</code>
<dd>Treat all calls as being far away (near).  If calls are assumed to be
far away, the compiler will always load the functions address up into a
register, and call indirect through the pointer.

<br><dt><code>-mno-ep</code>
<dt><code>-mep</code>
<dd>Do not optimize (do optimize) basic blocks that use the same index
pointer 4 or more times to copy pointer into the <code>ep</code> register, and
use the shorter <code>sld</code> and <code>sst</code> instructions.  The <code>-mep</code>
option is on by default if you optimize.

<br><dt><code>-mno-prolog-function</code>
<dt><code>-mprolog-function</code>
<dd>Do not use (do use) external functions to save and restore registers at
the prolog and epilog of a function.  The external functions are slower,
but use less code space if more than one function saves the same number
of registers.  The <code>-mprolog-function</code> option is on by default if
you optimize.

<br><dt><code>-mspace</code>
<dd>Try to make the code as small as possible.  At present, this just turns
on the <code>-mep</code> and <code>-mprolog-function</code> options.

<br><dt><code>-mtda=<var>n</var></code>
<dd>Put static or global variables whose size is <var>n</var> bytes or less into

area can hold up to 256 bytes in total (128 bytes for byte references).

<br><dt><code>-msda=<var>n</var></code>
<dd>Put static or global variables whose size is <var>n</var> bytes or less into
the small data area that register <code>gp</code> points to.  The small data
area can hold up to 64 kilobytes.

<br><dt><code>-mzda=<var>n</var></code>
<dd>Put static or global variables whose size is <var>n</var> bytes or less into
the first 32 kilobytes of memory.

<br><dt><code>-mv850</code>
<dd>Specify that the target processor is the V850.

<dt><code>-m32032</code>
<dt><code>-m32032</code>
<dd>Generate output for a 32032.  This is the default
when the compiler is configured for 32032 and 32016 based systems.

<br><dt><code>-m32332</code>
<dt><code>-m32332</code>
<dd>Generate output for a 32332.  This is the default
when the compiler is configured for 32332-based systems.

<br><dt><code>-m32532</code>
<dt><code>-m32532</code>
<dd>Generate output for a 32532.  This is the default
when the compiler is configured for 32532-based systems.

<br><dt><code>-m32081</code>
<dd>Generate output containing 32081 instructions for floating point. 
This is the default for all systems.

<br><dt><code>-m32381</code>
<dd>Generate output containing 32381 instructions for floating point.  This
also implies <code>-m32081</code>. The 32381 is only compatible with the 32332
and 32532 cpus. This is the default for the pc532-netbsd configuration.

<br><dt><code>-mmulti-add</code>
<dd>Try and generate multiply-add floating point instructions <code>polyF</code>
and <code>dotF</code>. This option is only available if the <code>-m32381</code>
option is in effect. Using these instructions requires changes to to
register allocation which generally has a negative impact on
performance.  This option should only be enabled when compiling code
particularly likely to make heavy use of multiply-add instructions.

<br><dt><code>-mnomulti-add</code>
<dd>Do not try and generate multiply-add floating point instructions
<code>polyF</code> and <code>dotF</code>. This is the default on all platforms.

<br><dt><code>-msoft-float</code>
<dd>Generate output containing library calls for floating point. 
<strong>Warning:</strong> the requisite libraries may not be available.

<br><dt><code>-mnobitfield</code>
<dd>Do not use the bit-field instructions. On some machines it is faster to
use shifting and masking operations. This is the default for the pc532.

<br><dt><code>-mbitfield</code>
<dd>Do use the bit-field instructions. This is the default for all platforms
except the pc532.

<br><dt><code>-mrtd</code>
<dd>Use a different function-calling convention, in which functions
that take a fixed number of arguments return pop their
arguments on return with the <code>ret</code> instruction.

<p>This calling convention is incompatible with the one normally
used on Unix, so you cannot use it if you need to call libraries
compiled with the Unix compiler.

<p>Also, you must provide function prototypes for all functions that
take variable numbers of arguments (including <code>printf</code>);
otherwise incorrect code will be generated for calls to those
functions.

<p>In addition, seriously incorrect code will result if you call a
function with too many arguments.  (Normally, extra arguments are
harmlessly ignored.)

<p>This option takes its name from the 680x0 <code>rtd</code> instruction.

<br><dt><code>-mregparam</code>
<dd>Use a different function-calling convention where the first two arguments
are passed in registers.

<p>This calling convention is incompatible with the one normally
used on Unix, so you cannot use it if you need to call libraries
compiled with the Unix compiler.

<br><dt><code>-mnoregparam</code>
<dd>Do not pass any arguments in registers. This is the default for all
targets.

<br><dt><code>-msb</code>
<dd>It is OK to use the sb as an index register which is always loaded with
zero. This is the default for the pc532-netbsd target.

<br><dt><code>-mnosb</code>
<dd>The sb register is not available for use or has not been initialized to
zero by the run time system. This is the default for all targets except
the pc532-netbsd. It is also implied whenever <code>-mhimem</code> or
<code>-fpic</code> is set.

<br><dt><code>-mhimem</code>
<dd>Many ns32000 series addressing modes use displacements of up to 512MB. 
If an address is above 512MB then displacements from zero can not be used. 
This option causes code to be generated which can be loaded above 512MB. 
This may be useful for operating systems or ROM code.

<br><dt><code>-mnohimem</code>
<dd>Assume code will be loaded in the first 512MB of virtual address space. 
This is the default for all platforms.

<h2>Options for Code Generation Conventions</h2>

<p>These machine-independent options control the interface conventions
used in code generation.

<p>Most of them have both positive and negative forms; the negative form
of <code>-ffoo</code> would be <code>-fno-foo</code>.  In the table below, only
one of the forms is listed--the one which is not the default.  You
can figure out the other form by either removing <code>no-</code> or adding
it.

<dl>
<dt><code>-fexceptions</code>
<dd>Enable exception handling. Generates extra code needed to propagate
exceptions.  For some targets, this implies generation of frame unwind
information for all functions. This can produce significant data size
overhead, although it does not affect execution. 
If you do not specify this option, it is enabled by
default for languages like C++ which normally require exception handling,
and disabled for languages like C that do not normally require it. 
However, when compiling C code that needs to interoperate properly with
exception handlers written in C++, you may need to enable this option. 
You may also wish to disable this option is you are compiling older C++
programs that don't use exception handling.

<br><dt><code>-fpcc-struct-return</code>
<dd>Return "short" <code>struct</code> and <code>union</code> values in memory like
longer ones, rather than in registers.  This convention is less
efficient, but it has the advantage of allowing intercallability between
GCC-compiled files and files compiled with other compilers.

<p>The precise convention for returning structures in memory depends
on the target configuration macros.

<p>Short structures and unions are those whose size and alignment match
that of some integer type.

<br><dt><code>-freg-struct-return</code>
<dd>Use the convention that <code>struct</code> and <code>union</code> values are
returned in registers when possible.  This is more efficient for small
structures than <code>-fpcc-struct-return</code>.

<p>If you specify neither <code>-fpcc-struct-return</code> nor its contrary
<code>-freg-struct-return</code>, GCC defaults to whichever convention is
standard for the target.  If there is no standard convention, GCC
defaults to <code>-fpcc-struct-return</code>, except on targets where GCC
is the principal compiler.  In those cases, we can choose the standard,
and we chose the more efficient register return alternative.

<br><dt><code>-fshort-enums</code>
<dd>Allocate to an <code>enum</code> type only as many bytes as it needs for the
declared range of possible values.  Specifically, the <code>enum</code> type
will be equivalent to the smallest integer type which has enough room.

<br><dt><code>-fshort-double</code>
<dd>Use the same size for <code>double</code> as for <code>float</code>.

<br><dt><code>-fshared-data</code>
<dd>Requests that the data and non-<code>const</code> variables of this
compilation be shared data rather than private data.  The distinction
makes sense only on certain operating systems, where shared data is
shared between processes running the same program, while private data
exists in one copy per process.

<br><dt><code>-fno-common</code>
<dd>Allocate even uninitialized global variables in the bss section of the
object file, rather than generating them as common blocks.  This has the
effect that if the same variable is declared (without <code>extern</code>) in
two different compilations, you will get an error when you link them. 
The only reason this might be useful is if you wish to verify that the
program will work on other systems which always work this way.

<br><dt><code>-fno-ident</code>
<dd>Ignore the <code>#ident</code> directive.

<br><dt><code>-fno-gnu-linker</code>
<dd>Do not output global initializations (such as C++ constructors and
destructors) in the form used by the GNU linker (on systems where the GNU
linker is the standard method of handling them).  Use this option when
you want to use a non-GNU linker, which also requires using the
<code>collect2</code> program to make sure the system linker includes
constructors and destructors.  (<code>collect2</code> is included in the GCC
distribution.)  For systems which <em>must</em> use <code>collect2</code>, the
compiler driver <code>gcc</code> is configured to do this automatically.

<br><dt><code>-finhibit-size-directive</code>
<dd>Don't output a <code>.size</code> assembler directive, or anything else that
would cause trouble if the function is split in the middle, and the
two halves are placed at locations far apart in memory.  This option is
used when compiling <code>crtstuff.c</code>; you should not need to use it
for anything else.

<br><dt><code>-fverbose-asm</code>
<dd>Put extra commentary information in the generated assembly code to
make it more readable.  This option is generally only of use to those
who actually need to read the generated assembly code (perhaps while
debugging the compiler itself).

<p><code>-fno-verbose-asm</code>, the default, causes the
extra information to be omitted and is useful when comparing two assembler
files.

<br><dt><code>-fvolatile</code>
<dd>Consider all memory references through pointers to be volatile.

<br><dt><code>-fvolatile-global</code>
<dd>Consider all memory references to extern and global data items to
be volatile.  GCC does not consider static data items to be volatile
because of this switch.

<br><dt><code>-fvolatile-static</code>
<dd>Consider all memory references to static data to be volatile.

<br><dt><code>-fpic</code>
<dd>Generate position-independent code (PIC) suitable for use in a shared
library, if supported for the target machine.  Such code accesses all
constant addresses through a global offset table (GOT).  The dynamic
loader resolves the GOT entries when the program starts (the dynamic
loader is not part of GCC; it is part of the operating system).  If
the GOT size for the linked executable exceeds a machine-specific
maximum size, you get an error message from the linker indicating that
<code>-fpic</code> does not work; in that case, recompile with <code>-fPIC</code>
instead.  (These maximums are 16k on the m88k, 8k on the Sparc, and 32k
on the m68k and RS/6000.  The 386 has no such limit.)

<p>Position-independent code requires special support, and therefore works
only on certain machines.  For the 386, GCC supports PIC for System V
but not for the Sun 386i.  Code generated for the IBM RS/6000 is always
position-independent.

<br><dt><code>-fPIC</code>
<dd>If supported for the target machine, emit position-independent code,
suitable for dynamic linking and avoiding any limit on the size of the
global offset table.  This option makes a difference on the m68k, m88k,
and the Sparc.

<p>Position-independent code requires special support, and therefore works
only on certain machines.

<br><dt><code>-ffixed-<var>reg</var></code>
<dd>Treat the register named <var>reg</var> as a fixed register; generated code
should never refer to it (except perhaps as a stack pointer, frame
pointer or in some other fixed role).

<p><var>reg</var> must be the name of a register.  The register names accepted
are machine-specific and are defined in the <code>REGISTER_NAMES</code>
macro in the machine description macro file.

<p>This flag does not have a negative form, because it specifies a
three-way choice.

<br><dt><code>-fcall-used-<var>reg</var></code>
<dd>Treat the register named <var>reg</var> as an allocable register that is
clobbered by function calls.  It may be allocated for temporaries or
variables that do not live across a call.  Functions compiled this way
will not save and restore the register <var>reg</var>.

<p>It is an error to used this flag with the frame pointer or stack pointer. 
Use of this flag for other registers that have fixed pervasive roles in
the machine's execution model will produce disastrous results.

<p>This flag does not have a negative form, because it specifies a
three-way choice.

<br><dt><code>-fcall-saved-<var>reg</var></code>
<dd>Treat the register named <var>reg</var> as an allocable register saved by
functions.  It may be allocated even for temporaries or variables that
live across a call.  Functions compiled this way will save and restore
the register <var>reg</var> if they use it.

<p>It is an error to used this flag with the frame pointer or stack pointer. 
Use of this flag for other registers that have fixed pervasive roles in
the machine's execution model will produce disastrous results.

<p>A different sort of disaster will result from the use of this flag for
a register in which function values may be returned.

<p>This flag does not have a negative form, because it specifies a
three-way choice.

<br><dt><code>-fpack-struct</code>
<dd>Pack all structure members together without holes.  Usually you would
not want to use this option, since it makes the code suboptimal, and
the offsets of structure members won't agree with system libraries.

<br><dt><code>-fcheck-memory-usage</code>
<dd>Generate extra code to check each memory access.  GCC will generate
code that is suitable for a detector of bad memory accesses such as
<code>Checker</code>.

<p>Normally, you should compile all, or none, of your code with this option.

<p>If you do mix code compiled with and without this option,
you must ensure that all code that has side effects
and that is called by code compiled with this option
is, itself, compiled with this option. 
If you do not, you might get erroneous messages from the detector.

<p>If you use functions from a library that have side-effects (such as
<code>read</code>), you might not be able to recompile the library and
specify this option.  In that case, you can enable the
<code>-fprefix-function-name</code> option, which requests GCC to encapsulate
your code and make other functions look as if they were compiled with
<code>-fcheck-memory-usage</code>.  This is done by calling "stubs",
which are provided by the detector.  If you cannot find or build
stubs for every function you call, you might have to specify
<code>-fcheck-memory-usage</code> without <code>-fprefix-function-name</code>.

<p>If you specify this option, you can not use the <code>asm</code> or
<code>__asm__</code> keywords in functions with memory checking enabled.  The
compiler cannot understand what the <code>asm</code> statement will do, and
therefore cannot generate the appropriate code, so it is rejected. 
However, the function attribute <code>no_check_memory_usage</code> will
disable memory checking within a function, and <code>asm</code> statements can
be put inside such functions.  Inline expansion of a non-checked
function within a checked function is permitted; the inline function's
memory accesses won't be checked, but the rest will.

<p>If you move your <code>asm</code> statements to non-checked inline functions,
but they do access memory, you can add calls to the support code in your
inline function, to indicate any reads, writes, or copies being done. 
These calls would be similar to those done in the stubs described above.

<br><dt><code>-fprefix-function-name</code>
<dd>Request GCC to add a prefix to the symbols generated for function names. 
GCC adds a prefix to the names of functions defined as well as
functions called.  Code compiled with this option and code compiled
without the option can't be linked together, unless stubs are used.

<p>If you compile the following code with <code>-fprefix-function-name</code>
<pre>extern void bar (int);
void
foo (int a)
{
  return bar (a + 5);
}
</pre>

<p>GCC will compile the code as if it was written:
<pre>extern void prefix_bar (int);
void
prefix_foo (int a)
{
  return prefix_bar (a + 5);
}
</pre>
This option is designed to be used with <code>-fcheck-memory-usage</code>.

<br><dt><code>-finstrument-functions</code>
<dd>Generate instrumentation calls for entry and exit to functions.  Just
after function entry and just before function exit, the following
profiling functions will be called with the address of the current
function and its call site.  (On some platforms,
<code>__builtin_return_address</code> does not work beyond the current
function, so the call site information may not be available to the
profiling functions otherwise.)

<pre>void __cyg_profile_func_enter (void *this_fn, void *call_site);
void __cyg_profile_func_exit  (void *this_fn, void *call_site);
</pre>

<p>The first argument is the address of the start of the current function,
which may be looked up exactly in the symbol table.

<p>This instrumentation is also done for functions expanded inline in other
functions.  The profiling calls will indicate where, conceptually, the
inline function is entered and exited.  This means that addressable
versions of such functions must be available.  If all your uses of a
function are expanded inline, this may mean an additional expansion of
code size.  If you use <code>extern inline</code> in your C code, an
addressable version of such functions must be provided.  (This is
normally the case anyways, but if you get lucky and the optimizer always
expands the functions inline, you might have gotten away without
providing static copies.)

<p>A function may be given the attribute <code>no_instrument_function</code>, in
which case this instrumentation will not be done.  This can be used, for
example, for the profiling functions listed above, high-priority
interrupt routines, and any functions from which the profiling functions
cannot safely be called (perhaps signal handlers, if the profiling
routines generate output or allocate memory).

<br><dt><code>-fstack-check</code>
<dd>Generate code to verify that you do not go beyond the boundary of the
stack.  You should specify this flag if you are running in an
environment with multiple threads, but only rarely need to specify it in
a single-threaded environment since stack overflow is automatically
detected on nearly all systems if there is only one stack.

<br><dt><code>-fargument-alias</code>
<dt><code>-fargument-noalias</code>
<dt><code>-fargument-noalias-global</code>
<dd>Specify the possible relationships among parameters and between
parameters and global data.

<p><code>-fargument-alias</code> specifies that arguments (parameters) may
alias each other and may alias global storage. 
<code>-fargument-noalias</code> specifies that arguments do not alias
each other, but may alias global storage. 
<code>-fargument-noalias-global</code> specifies that arguments do not
alias each other and do not alias global storage.

<p>Each language will automatically use whatever option is required by
the language standard.  You should not need to use these options yourself.

<br><dt><code>-fleading-underscore</code>
<dd>This option and its counterpart, -fno-leading-underscore, forcibly
change the way C symbols are represented in the object file.  One use
is to help link with legacy assembly code.

<p>Be warned that you should know what you are doing when invoking this
option, and that not all targets provide complete support for it.

<h2>Environment Variables Affecting GCC</h2>

<p>This section describes several environment variables that affect how GCC
operates.  Some of them work by specifying directories or prefixes to use
when searching for various kinds of files. Some are used to specify other
aspects of the compilation environment.

<p>Note that you can also specify places to search using options such as
<code>-B</code>, <code>-I</code> and <code>-L</code> (see <a href="#Directory%20Options">Directory Options</a>).  These
take precedence over places specified using environment variables, which
in turn take precedence over those specified by the configuration of GCC. 
See <a href="#Driver">Driver</a>.

<dl>
<dt><code>LANG</code>
<dt><code>LC_CTYPE</code>
<dt><code>LC_MESSAGES</code>
<dt><code>LC_ALL</code>
<dd>These environment variables control the way that GCC uses
localization information that allow GCC to work with different
national conventions.  GCC inspects the locale categories
<code>LC_CTYPE</code> and <code>LC_MESSAGES</code> if it has been configured to do
so.  These locale categories can be set to any value supported by your
installation.  A typical value is <code>en_UK</code> for English in the United
Kingdom.

<p>The <code>LC_CTYPE</code> environment variable specifies character
classification.  GCC uses it to determine the character boundaries in
a string; this is needed for some multibyte encodings that contain quote
and escape characters that would otherwise be interpreted as a string
end or escape.

<p>The <code>LC_MESSAGES</code> environment variable specifies the language to
use in diagnostic messages.

<p>If the <code>LC_ALL</code> environment variable is set, it overrides the value
of <code>LC_CTYPE</code> and <code>LC_MESSAGES</code>; otherwise, <code>LC_CTYPE</code>
and <code>LC_MESSAGES</code> default to the value of the <code>LANG</code>
environment variable.  If none of these variables are set, GCC
defaults to traditional C English behavior.

<br><dt><code>TMPDIR</code>
<dd>If <code>TMPDIR</code> is set, it specifies the directory to use for temporary
files.  GCC uses temporary files to hold the output of one stage of
compilation which is to be used as input to the next stage: for example,
the output of the preprocessor, which is the input to the compiler
proper.

<br><dt><code>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</code>
<dd>If <code>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</code> is set, it specifies a prefix to use in the
names of the subprograms executed by the compiler.  No slash is added
when this prefix is combined with the name of a subprogram, but you can
specify a prefix that ends with a slash if you wish.

<p>If GCC cannot find the subprogram using the specified prefix, it
tries looking in the usual places for the subprogram.

<p>The default value of <code>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</code> is
<code><var>prefix</var>/lib/gcc-lib/</code> where <var>prefix</var> is the value
of <code>prefix</code> when you ran the <code>configure</code> script.

<p>Other prefixes specified with <code>-B</code> take precedence over this prefix.

<p>This prefix is also used for finding files such as <code>crt0.o</code> that are
used for linking.

<p>In addition, the prefix is used in an unusual way in finding the
directories to search for header files.  For each of the standard
directories whose name normally begins with <code>/usr/local/lib/gcc-lib</code>
(more precisely, with the value of <code>GCC_INCLUDE_DIR</code>), GCC tries
replacing that beginning with the specified prefix to produce an
alternate directory name.  Thus, with <code>-Bfoo/</code>, GCC will search
<code>foo/bar</code> where it would normally search <code>/usr/local/lib/bar</code>. 
These alternate directories are searched first; the standard directories
come next.

<br><dt><code>COMPILER_PATH</code>
<dd>The value of <code>COMPILER_PATH</code> is a colon-separated list of
directories, much like <code>PATH</code>.  GCC tries the directories thus
specified when searching for subprograms, if it can't find the
subprograms using <code>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</code>.

<br><dt><code>LIBRARY_PATH</code>
<dd>The value of <code>LIBRARY_PATH</code> is a colon-separated list of
directories, much like <code>PATH</code>.  When configured as a native compiler,
GCC tries the directories thus specified when searching for special
linker files, if it can't find them using <code>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</code>.  Linking
using GCC also uses these directories when searching for ordinary
libraries for the <code>-l</code> option (but directories specified with
<code>-L</code> come first).

<br><dt><code>C_INCLUDE_PATH</code>
<dt><code>CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH</code>
<dt><code>OBJC_INCLUDE_PATH</code>
<dd>These environment variables pertain to particular languages.  Each
variable's value is a colon-separated list of directories, much like
<code>PATH</code>.  When GCC searches for header files, it tries the
directories listed in the variable for the language you are using, after
the directories specified with <code>-I</code> but before the standard header
file directories.

<br><dt><code>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</code>
<dd>If this variable is set, its value specifies how to output dependencies
for Make based on the header files processed by the compiler.  This
output looks much like the output from the <code>-M</code> option
(see <a href="#Preprocessor%20Options">Preprocessor Options</a>), but it goes to a separate file, and is
in addition to the usual results of compilation.

<p>The value of <code>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</code> can be just a file name, in
which case the Make rules are written to that file, guessing the target
name from the source file name.  Or the value can have the form
<code><var>file</var> <var>target</var></code>, in which case the rules are written to
file <var>file</var> using <var>target</var> as the target name.

<br><dt><code>LANG</code>
<dd>This variable is used to pass locale information to the compiler. One way in
which this information is used is to determine the character set to be used
when character literals, string literals and comments are parsed in C and C++. 
When the compiler is configured to allow multibyte characters,
the following values for <code>LANG</code> are recognized:

<dl>
<dt><code>C-JIS</code>
<dd>Recognize JIS characters. 
<br><dt><code>C-SJIS</code>
<dd>Recognize SJIS characters. 
<br><dt><code>C-EUCJP</code>
<dd>Recognize EUCJP characters. 
</dl>

<p>If <code>LANG</code> is not defined, or if it has some other value, then the
compiler will use mblen and mbtowc as defined by the default locale to
recognize and translate multibyte characters. 
</dl>

<br>

<h2>Running Protoize</h2>

<p>The program <code>protoize</code> is an optional part of GNU C.  You can use
it to add prototypes to a program, thus converting the program to ANSI
C in one respect.  The companion program <code>unprotoize</code> does the
reverse: it removes argument types from any prototypes that are found.

<p>When you run these programs, you must specify a set of source files as
command line arguments.  The conversion programs start out by compiling
these files to see what functions they define.  The information gathered
about a file <var>foo</var> is saved in a file named <code><var>foo</var>.X</code>.

<p>After scanning comes actual conversion.  The specified files are all
eligible to be converted; any files they include (whether sources or
just headers) are eligible as well.

<p>But not all the eligible files are converted.  By default,
<code>protoize</code> and <code>unprotoize</code> convert only source and header
files in the current directory.  You can specify additional directories
whose files should be converted with the <code>-d <var>directory</var></code>
option.  You can also specify particular files to exclude with the
<code>-x <var>file</var></code> option.  A file is converted if it is eligible, its
directory name matches one of the specified directory names, and its
name within the directory has not been excluded.

<p>Basic conversion with <code>protoize</code> consists of rewriting most
function definitions and function declarations to specify the types of
the arguments.  The only ones not rewritten are those for varargs
functions.

<p><code>protoize</code> optionally inserts prototype declarations at the
beginning of the source file, to make them available for any calls that
precede the function's definition.  Or it can insert prototype
declarations with block scope in the blocks where undeclared functions
are called.

<p>Basic conversion with <code>unprotoize</code> consists of rewriting most
function declarations to remove any argument types, and rewriting
function definitions to the old-style pre-ANSI form.

<p>Both conversion programs print a warning for any function declaration or
definition that they can't convert.  You can suppress these warnings
with <code>-q</code>.

<p>The output from <code>protoize</code> or <code>unprotoize</code> replaces the
original source file.  The original file is renamed to a name ending
with <code>.save</code> (for DOS, the saved filename ends in <code>.sav</code>
without the original <code>.c</code> suffix).  If the <code>.save</code> (<code>.sav</code>
for DOS) file already exists, then the source file is simply discarded.

<p><code>protoize</code> and <code>unprotoize</code> both depend on GCC itself to
scan the program and collect information about the functions it uses. 
So neither of these programs will work until GCC is installed.

<p>Here is a table of the options you can use with <code>protoize</code> and
<code>unprotoize</code>.  Each option works with both programs unless
otherwise stated.

<dl>
<dt><code>-B <var>directory</var></code>
<dd>Look for the file <code>SYSCALLS.c.X</code> in <var>directory</var>, instead of the
usual directory (normally <code>/usr/local/lib</code>).  This file contains
prototype information about standard system functions.  This option
applies only to <code>protoize</code>.

<br><dt><code>-c <var>compilation-options</var></code>
<dd>Use  <var>compilation-options</var> as the options when running <code>gcc</code> to
produce the <code>.X</code> files.  The special option <code>-aux-info</code> is
always passed in addition, to tell <code>gcc</code> to write a <code>.X</code> file.

<p>Note that the compilation options must be given as a single argument to
<code>protoize</code> or <code>unprotoize</code>.  If you want to specify several
<code>gcc</code> options, you must quote the entire set of compilation options
to make them a single word in the shell.

<p>There are certain <code>gcc</code> arguments that you cannot use, because they
would produce the wrong kind of output.  These include <code>-g</code>,
<code>-O</code>, <code>-c</code>, <code>-S</code>, and <code>-o</code> If you include these in
the <var>compilation-options</var>, they are ignored.

<br><dt><code>-C</code>
<dd>Rename files to end in <code>.C</code> (<code>.cc</code> for DOS-based file
systems) instead of <code>.c</code>.  This is convenient if you are converting
a C program to C++.  This option applies only to <code>protoize</code>.

<br><dt><code>-g</code>
<dd>Add explicit global declarations.  This means inserting explicit
declarations at the beginning of each source file for each function
that is called in the file and was not declared.  These declarations
precede the first function definition that contains a call to an
undeclared function.  This option applies only to <code>protoize</code>.

<br><dt><code>-i <var>string</var></code>
<dd>Indent old-style parameter declarations with the string <var>string</var>. 
This option applies only to <code>protoize</code>.

<p><code>unprotoize</code> converts prototyped function definitions to old-style
function definitions, where the arguments are declared between the
argument list and the initial <code>{</code>.  By default, <code>unprotoize</code>
uses five spaces as the indentation.  If you want to indent with just
one space instead, use <code>-i " "</code>.

<br><dt><code>-k</code>
<dd>Keep the <code>.X</code> files.  Normally, they are deleted after conversion
is finished.

<br><dt><code>-l</code>
<dd>Add explicit local declarations.  <code>protoize</code> with <code>-l</code> inserts
a prototype declaration for each function in each block which calls the
function without any declaration.  This option applies only to
<code>protoize</code>.

<br><dt><code>-n</code>
<dd>Make no real changes.  This mode just prints information about the conversions
that would have been done without <code>-n</code>.

<br><dt><code>-N</code>
<dd>Make no <code>.save</code> files.  The original files are simply deleted. 
Use this option with caution.

<br><dt><code>-p <var>program</var></code>
<dd>Use the program <var>program</var> as the compiler.  Normally, the name
<code>gcc</code> is used.

<br><dt><code>-q</code>
<dd>Work quietly.  Most warnings are suppressed.

<br><dt><code>-v</code>
<dd>Print the version number, just like <code>-v</code> for <code>gcc</code>. 
</dl>

<p>If you need special compiler options to compile one of your program's
source files, then you should generate that file's <code>.X</code> file
specially, by running <code>gcc</code> on that source file with the
appropriate options and the option <code>-aux-info</code>.  Then run
<code>protoize</code> on the entire set of files.  <code>protoize</code> will use
the existing <code>.X</code> file because it is newer than the source file. 
For example:

<pre>gcc -Dfoo=bar file1.c -aux-info
protoize *.c
</pre>

<p>You need to include the special files along with the rest in the
<code>protoize</code> command, even though their <code>.X</code> files already
exist, because otherwise they won't get converted.

<p>See <a href="#Protoize%20Caveats">Protoize Caveats</a>, for more information on how to use
<code>protoize</code> successfully.

</ul>

<p>Here is the procedure for installing GNU CC on a GNU or Unix system. 
See <a href="#VMS%20Install">VMS Install</a>, for VMS systems.  In this section we assume you
compile in the same directory that contains the source files; see
<a href="#Other%20Dir">Other Dir</a>, to find out how to compile in a separate directory on
Unix systems.

<p>You cannot install GNU C by itself on MSDOS; it will not compile under
any MSDOS compiler except itself.  You need to get the complete
compilation package DJGPP, which includes binaries as well as sources,
and includes all the necessary compilation tools and libraries.

<ol type=1 start=1>
</p><li>If you have built GNU CC previously in the same directory for a
different target machine, do <code>make distclean</code> to delete all files
that might be invalid.  One of the files this deletes is
<code>Makefile</code>; if <code>make distclean</code> complains that <code>Makefile</code>
does not exist, it probably means that the directory is already suitably
clean.

<li>On a System V release 4 system, make sure <code>/usr/bin</code> precedes
<code>/usr/ucb</code> in <code>PATH</code>.  The <code>cc</code> command in
<code>/usr/ucb</code> uses libraries which have bugs.

<li>Make sure the Bison parser generator is installed.  (This is
unnecessary if the Bison output files <code>c-parse.c</code> and
<code>cexp.c</code> are more recent than <code>c-parse.y</code> and <code>cexp.y</code>
and you do not plan to change the <code>.y</code> files.)

<p>Bison versions older than Sept 8, 1988 will produce incorrect output
for <code>c-parse.c</code>.

</p><li>If you have chosen a configuration for GNU CC which requires other GNU
tools (such as GAS or the GNU linker) instead of the standard system
tools, install the required tools in the build directory under the names
<code>as</code>, <code>ld</code> or whatever is appropriate.  This will enable the
compiler to find the proper tools for compilation of the program
<code>enquire</code>.

<p>Alternatively, you can do subsequent compilation using a value of the
<code>PATH</code> environment variable such that the necessary GNU tools come
before the standard system tools.

</p><li>Specify the host, build and target machine configurations.  You do this
when you run the <code>configure</code> script.

<p>The <dfn>build</dfn> machine is the system which you are using, the
<dfn>host</dfn> machine is the system where you want to run the resulting
compiler (normally the build machine), and the <dfn>target</dfn> machine is
the system for which you want the compiler to generate code.

<p>If you are building a compiler to produce code for the machine it runs
on (a native compiler), you normally do not need to specify any operands
to <code>configure</code>; it will try to guess the type of machine you are on
and use that as the build, host and target machines.  So you don't need
to specify a configuration when building a native compiler unless
<code>configure</code> cannot figure out what your configuration is or guesses
wrong.

<p>In those cases, specify the build machine's <dfn>configuration name</dfn>
with the <code>--host</code> option; the host and target will default to be
the same as the host machine.  (If you are building a cross-compiler,
see <a href="#Cross-Compiler">Cross-Compiler</a>.)

<p>Here is an example:

<pre>./configure --host=sparc-sun-sunos4.1
</pre>

<p>A configuration name may be canonical or it may be more or less
abbreviated.

<p>A canonical configuration name has three parts, separated by dashes. 
It looks like this: <code><var>cpu</var>-<var>company</var>-<var>system</var></code>. 
(The three parts may themselves contain dashes; <code>configure</code>
can figure out which dashes serve which purpose.)  For example,
<code>m68k-sun-sunos4.1</code> specifies a Sun 3.

<p>You can also replace parts of the configuration by nicknames or aliases. 
For example, <code>sun3</code> stands for <code>m68k-sun</code>, so
<code>sun3-sunos4.1</code> is another way to specify a Sun 3.  You can also
use simply <code>sun3-sunos</code>, since the version of SunOS is assumed by
default to be version 4.

<p>You can specify a version number after any of the system types, and some
of the CPU types.  In most cases, the version is irrelevant, and will be
ignored.  So you might as well specify the version if you know it.

<p>See <a href="#Configurations">Configurations</a>, for a list of supported configuration names and
notes on many of the configurations.  You should check the notes in that
section before proceeding any further with the installation of GNU CC.

</p><li>When running <code>configure</code>, you may also need to specify certain
additional options that describe variant hardware and software
configurations.  These are <code>--with-gnu-as</code>, <code>--with-gnu-ld</code>,
<code>--with-stabs</code> and <code>--nfp</code>.

<dl>
<dt><code>--with-gnu-as</code>
<dd>If you will use GNU CC with the GNU assembler (GAS), you should declare
this by using the <code>--with-gnu-as</code> option when you run
<code>configure</code>.

<p>Using this option does not install GAS.  It only modifies the output of
GNU CC to work with GAS.  Building and installing GAS is up to you.

<p>Conversely, if you <em>do not</em> wish to use GAS and do not specify
<code>--with-gnu-as</code> when building GNU CC, it is up to you to make sure
that GAS is not installed.  GNU CC searches for a program named
<code>as</code> in various directories; if the program it finds is GAS, then
it runs GAS.  If you are not sure where GNU CC finds the assembler it is
using, try specifying <code>-v</code> when you run it.

<p>The systems where it makes a difference whether you use GAS are<br>
<code>hppa1.0-<var>any</var>-<var>any</var></code>, <code>hppa1.1-<var>any</var>-<var>any</var></code>,
<code>i386-<var>any</var>-sysv</code>, <code>i386-<var>any</var>-isc</code>,<br>
<code>i860-<var>any</var>-bsd</code>, <code>m68k-bull-sysv</code>,<br>
<code>m68k-hp-hpux</code>, <code>m68k-sony-bsd</code>,<br>
<code>m68k-altos-sysv</code>, <code>m68000-hp-hpux</code>,<br>
<code>m68000-att-sysv</code>, <code><var>any</var>-lynx-lynxos</code>,
and <code>mips-<var>any</var></code>). 
On any other system, <code>--with-gnu-as</code> has no effect.

<p>On the systems listed above (except for the HP-PA, for ISC on the
386, and for <code>mips-sgi-irix5.*</code>), if you use GAS, you should also
use the GNU linker (and specify <code>--with-gnu-ld</code>).

<br><dt><code>--with-gnu-ld</code>
<dd>Specify the option <code>--with-gnu-ld</code> if you plan to use the GNU
linker with GNU CC.

<p>This option does not cause the GNU linker to be installed; it just
modifies the behavior of GNU CC to work with the GNU linker.

<br><dt><code>--with-stabs</code>
<dd>On MIPS based systems and on Alphas, you must specify whether you want
GNU CC to create the normal ECOFF debugging format, or to use BSD-style
stabs passed through the ECOFF symbol table.  The normal ECOFF debug
format cannot fully handle languages other than C.  BSD stabs format can
handle other languages, but it only works with the GNU debugger GDB.

<p>Normally, GNU CC uses the ECOFF debugging format by default; if you
prefer BSD stabs, specify <code>--with-stabs</code> when you configure GNU
CC.

<p>No matter which default you choose when you configure GNU CC, the user
can use the <code>-gcoff</code> and <code>-gstabs+</code> options to specify explicitly
the debug format for a particular compilation.

<p><code>--with-stabs</code> is meaningful on the ISC system on the 386, also, if
<code>--with-gas</code> is used.  It selects use of stabs debugging
information embedded in COFF output.  This kind of debugging information
supports C++ well; ordinary COFF debugging information does not.

<p><code>--with-stabs</code> is also meaningful on 386 systems running SVR4.  It
selects use of stabs debugging information embedded in ELF output.  The
C++ compiler currently (2.6.0) does not support the DWARF debugging
information normally used on 386 SVR4 platforms; stabs provide a
workable alternative.  This requires gas and gdb, as the normal SVR4
tools can not generate or interpret stabs.

<br><dt><code>--nfp</code>
<dd>On certain systems, you must specify whether the machine has a floating
point unit.  These systems include <code>m68k-sun-sunos<var>n</var></code> and
<code>m68k-isi-bsd</code>.  On any other system, <code>--nfp</code> currently has no
effect, though perhaps there are other systems where it could usefully
make a difference.

<br><dt><code>--enable-haifa</code>
<dt><code>--disable-haifa</code>
<dd>Use <code>--enable-haifa</code> to enable use of an experimental instruction
scheduler (from IBM Haifa).  This may or may not produce better code. 
Some targets on which it is known to be a win enable it by default; use
<code>--disable-haifa</code> to disable it in these cases.  <code>configure</code>
will print out whether the Haifa scheduler is enabled when it is run.

<br><dt><code>--enable-threads=<var>type</var></code>
<dd>Certain systems, notably Linux-based GNU systems, can't be relied on to
supply a threads facility for the Objective C runtime and so will
default to single-threaded runtime.  They may, however, have a library
threads implementation available, in which case threads can be enabled
with this option by supplying a suitable <var>type</var>, probably
<code>posix</code>.  The possibilities for <var>type</var> are <code>single</code>,
<code>posix</code>, <code>win32</code>, <code>solaris</code>, <code>irix</code> and <code>mach</code>.

<br><dt><code>--enable-checking</code>
<dd>When you specify this option, the compiler is built to perform checking
of tree node types when referencing fields of that node.  This does not
change the generated code, but adds error checking within the compiler. 
This will slow down the compiler and may only work properly if you
are building the compiler with GNU C.

<p>The <code>configure</code> script searches subdirectories of the source
directory for other compilers that are to be integrated into GNU CC. 
The GNU compiler for C++, called G++ is in a subdirectory named
<code>cp</code>.  <code>configure</code> inserts rules into <code>Makefile</code> to build
all of those compilers.

<p>Here we spell out what files will be set up by <code>configure</code>.  Normally
you need not be concerned with these files.

<ul>
<li>A file named <code>config.h</code> is created that contains a <code>#include</code>
of the top-level config file for the machine you will run the compiler
on (see <a href="#Config">Config</a>).  This file is responsible for defining information
about the host machine.  It includes <code>tm.h</code>.

<p>The top-level config file is located in the subdirectory <code>config</code>. 
Its name is always <code>xm-<var>something</var>.h</code>; usually
<code>xm-<var>machine</var>.h</code>, but there are some exceptions.

<p>If your system does not support symbolic links, you might want to
set up <code>config.h</code> to contain a <code>#include</code> command which
refers to the appropriate file.

</p><li>A file named <code>tconfig.h</code> is created which includes the top-level config
file for your target machine.  This is used for compiling certain
programs to run on that machine.

<li>A file named <code>tm.h</code> is created which includes the
machine-description macro file for your target machine.  It should be in
the subdirectory <code>config</code> and its name is often
<code><var>machine</var>.h</code>. 
</ul>

<br><dt><code>--enable-nls</code>
<dt><code>--disable-nls</code>
<dd>The <code>--enable-nls</code> option enables Native Language Support (NLS),
which lets GCC output diagnostics in languages other than American
English.  No translations are available yet, so the main users of this
option now are those translating GCC's diagnostics who want to test
their work.  Once translations become available, Native Language Support
will become enabled by default.  The <code>--disable-nls</code> option
disables NLS.

<br><dt><code>--with-included-gettext</code>
<dd>If NLS is enabled, the GCC build procedure normally attempts to use the
host's <code>gettext</code> libraries, and falls back on GCC's copy of the GNU
<code>gettext</code> library only if the host libraries do not suffice.  The
<code>--with-included-gettext</code> option causes the build procedure to
prefer its copy of GNU <code>gettext</code>.

<br><dt><code>--with-catgets</code>
<dd>If NLS is enabled, and if the host lacks <code>gettext</code> but has the
inferior <code>catgets</code> interface, the GCC build procedure normally
ignores <code>catgets</code> and instead uses GCC's copy of the GNU
<code>gettext</code> library.  The <code>--with-catgets</code> option causes the
build procedure to use the host's <code>catgets</code> in this situation.

<br><dt><code>--enable-win32-registry</code>
<dt><code>--enable-win32-registry=<var>KEY</var></code>
<dt><code>--disable-win32-registry</code>
<dd>The <code>--enable-win32-registry</code> option enables Windows-hosted GCC
to look up installations paths in the registry using the following key:

<pre><code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Free Software Foundation\&lt;KEY&gt;</code>
</pre>

<p>&lt;KEY&gt; defaults to GCC version number, and can be overridden by the
<code>--enable-win32-registry=KEY</code> option. Vendors and distributors
who use custom installers are encouraged to provide a different key,
perhaps one comprised of vendor name and GCC version number, to
avoid conflict with existing installations. This feature is enabled
by default, and can be disabled by <code>--disable-win32-registry</code>
option.  This option has no effect on the other hosts. 
</dl>

</p><li>In certain cases, you should specify certain other options when you run
<code>configure</code>.

<ul>
<li>The standard directory for installing GNU CC is <code>/usr/local/lib</code>. 
If you want to install its files somewhere else, specify
<code>--prefix=<var>dir</var></code> when you run <code>configure</code>.  Here <var>dir</var>
is a directory name to use instead of <code>/usr/local</code> for all purposes
with one exception: the directory <code>/usr/local/include</code> is searched
for header files no matter where you install the compiler.  To override
this name, use the <code>--with-local-prefix</code> option below.  The directory
you specify need not exist, but its parent directory must exist.

<li>Specify <code>--with-local-prefix=<var>dir</var></code> if you want the compiler to
search directory <code><var>dir</var>/include</code> for locally installed header
files <em>instead</em> of <code>/usr/local/include</code>.

<p>You should specify <code>--with-local-prefix</code> <strong>only</strong> if your site has
a different convention (not <code>/usr/local</code>) for where to put
site-specific files.

<p>The default value for <code>--with-local-prefix</code> is <code>/usr/local</code>
regardless of the value of <code>--prefix</code>.  Specifying <code>--prefix</code>
has no effect on which directory GNU CC searches for local header files. 
This may seem counterintuitive, but actually it is logical.

<p>The purpose of <code>--prefix</code> is to specify where to <em>install GNU
CC</em>.  The local header files in <code>/usr/local/include</code>--if you put
any in that directory--are not part of GNU CC.  They are part of other
programs--perhaps many others.  (GNU CC installs its own header files
in another directory which is based on the <code>--prefix</code> value.)

<p><strong>Do not</strong> specify <code>/usr</code> as the <code>--with-local-prefix</code>!  The
directory you use for <code>--with-local-prefix</code> <strong>must not</strong> contain
any of the system's standard header files.  If it did contain them,
certain programs would be miscompiled (including GNU Emacs, on certain
targets), because this would override and nullify the header file
corrections made by the <code>fixincludes</code> script.

<p>Indications are that people who use this option use it based on
mistaken ideas of what it is for.  People use it as if it specified
where to install part of GNU CC.  Perhaps they make this assumption
because installing GNU CC creates the directory. 
</ul>

</p><li>Build the compiler.  Just type <code>make LANGUAGES=c</code> in the compiler
directory.

<p><code>LANGUAGES=c</code> specifies that only the C compiler should be
compiled.  The makefile normally builds compilers for all the supported
languages; currently, C, C++ and Objective C.  However, C is the only
language that is sure to work when you build with other non-GNU C
compilers.  In addition, building anything but C at this stage is a
waste of time.

<p>In general, you can specify the languages to build by typing the
argument <code>LANGUAGES="<var>list</var>"</code>, where <var>list</var> is one or more
words from the list <code>c</code>, <code>c++</code>, and <code>objective-c</code>.  If
you have any additional GNU compilers as subdirectories of the GNU CC
source directory, you may also specify their names in this list.

<p>Ignore any warnings you may see about "statement not reached" in
<code>insn-emit.c</code>; they are normal.  Also, warnings about "unknown
escape sequence" are normal in <code>genopinit.c</code> and perhaps some
other files.  Likewise, you should ignore warnings about "constant is
so large that it is unsigned" in <code>insn-emit.c</code> and
<code>insn-recog.c</code>, a warning about a comparison always being zero
in <code>enquire.o</code>, and warnings about shift counts exceeding type
widths in <code>cexp.y</code>.  Any other compilation errors may represent bugs in
the port to your machine or operating system, and
should be investigated and reported (see <a href="#Bugs">Bugs</a>).

<p>Some compilers fail to compile GNU CC because they have bugs or
limitations.  For example, the Microsoft compiler is said to run out of
macro space.  Some Ultrix compilers run out of expression space; then
you need to break up the statement where the problem happens.

</p><li>If you are building a cross-compiler, stop here.  See <a href="#Cross-Compiler">Cross-Compiler</a>.

<li>Move the first-stage object files and executables into a subdirectory
with this command:

<pre>make stage1
</pre>

<p>The files are moved into a subdirectory named <code>stage1</code>. 
Once installation is complete, you may wish to delete these files
with <code>rm -r stage1</code>.

</p><li>If you have chosen a configuration for GNU CC which requires other GNU
tools (such as GAS or the GNU linker) instead of the standard system
tools, install the required tools in the <code>stage1</code> subdirectory
under the names <code>as</code>, <code>ld</code> or whatever is appropriate.  This
will enable the stage 1 compiler to find the proper tools in the
following stage.

<p>Alternatively, you can do subsequent compilation using a value of the
<code>PATH</code> environment variable such that the necessary GNU tools come
before the standard system tools.

</p><li>Recompile the compiler with itself, with this command:

<pre>make CC="stage1/xgcc -Bstage1/" CFLAGS="-g -O2"
</pre>

<p>This is called making the stage 2 compiler.

<p>The command shown above builds compilers for all the supported
languages.  If you don't want them all, you can specify the languages to
build by typing the argument <code>LANGUAGES="<var>list</var>"</code>.  <var>list</var>
should contain one or more words from the list <code>c</code>, <code>c++</code>,
<code>objective-c</code>, and <code>proto</code>.  Separate the words with spaces. 
<code>proto</code> stands for the programs <code>protoize</code> and
<code>unprotoize</code>; they are not a separate language, but you use
<code>LANGUAGES</code> to enable or disable their installation.

<p>If you are going to build the stage 3 compiler, then you might want to
build only the C language in stage 2.

<p>Once you have built the stage 2 compiler, if you are short of disk
space, you can delete the subdirectory <code>stage1</code>.

<p>On a 68000 or 68020 system lacking floating point hardware,
unless you have selected a <code>tm.h</code> file that expects by default
that there is no such hardware, do this instead:

<pre>make CC="stage1/xgcc -Bstage1/" CFLAGS="-g -O2 -msoft-float"
</pre>

</p><li>If you wish to test the compiler by compiling it with itself one more
time, install any other necessary GNU tools (such as GAS or the GNU
linker) in the <code>stage2</code> subdirectory as you did in the
<code>stage1</code> subdirectory, then do this:

<pre>make stage2
make CC="stage2/xgcc -Bstage2/" CFLAGS="-g -O2"
</pre>

<p>This is called making the stage 3 compiler.  Aside from the <code>-B</code>
option, the compiler options should be the same as when you made the
stage 2 compiler.  But the <code>LANGUAGES</code> option need not be the
same.  The command shown above builds compilers for all the supported
languages; if you don't want them all, you can specify the languages to
build by typing the argument <code>LANGUAGES="<var>list</var>"</code>, as described
above.

<p>If you do not have to install any additional GNU tools, you may use the
command

<pre>make bootstrap LANGUAGES=<var>language-list</var> BOOT_CFLAGS=<var>option-list</var>
</pre>

<p>instead of making <code>stage1</code>, <code>stage2</code>, and performing
the two compiler builds.

</p><li>Compare the latest object files with the stage 2 object files--they
ought to be identical, aside from time stamps (if any).

<p>On some systems, meaningful comparison of object files is impossible;
they always appear "different."  This is currently true on Solaris and
some systems that use ELF object file format.  On some versions of Irix
on SGI machines and DEC Unix (OSF/1) on Alpha systems, you will not be
able to compare the files without specifying <code>-save-temps</code>; see the
description of individual systems above to see if you get comparison
failures.  You may have similar problems on other systems.

<p>Use this command to compare the files:

<pre>make compare
</pre>

<p>This will mention any object files that differ between stage 2 and stage
3.  Any difference, no matter how innocuous, indicates that the stage 2
compiler has compiled GNU CC incorrectly, and is therefore a potentially
serious bug which you should investigate and report (see <a href="#Bugs">Bugs</a>).

<p>If your system does not put time stamps in the object files, then this
is a faster way to compare them (using the Bourne shell):

<pre>for file in *.o; do
cmp $file stage2/$file
done
</pre>

<p>If you have built the compiler with the <code>-mno-mips-tfile</code> option on
MIPS machines, you will not be able to compare the files.

</p><li>Install the compiler driver, the compiler's passes and run-time support
with <code>make install</code>.  Use the same value for <code>CC</code>,
<code>CFLAGS</code> and <code>LANGUAGES</code> that you used when compiling the
files that are being installed.  One reason this is necessary is that
some versions of Make have bugs and recompile files gratuitously when
you do this step.  If you use the same variable values, those files will
be recompiled properly.

<p>For example, if you have built the stage 2 compiler, you can use the
following command:

<pre>make install CC="stage2/xgcc -Bstage2/" CFLAGS="-g -O" LANGUAGES="<var>list</var>"
</pre>

<p>This copies the files <code>cc1</code>, <code>cpp</code> and <code>libgcc.a</code> to
files <code>cc1</code>, <code>cpp</code> and <code>libgcc.a</code> in the directory
<code>/usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/<var>target</var>/<var>version</var></code>, which is where
the compiler driver program looks for them.  Here <var>target</var> is the
canonicalized form of target machine type specified when you ran
<code>configure</code>, and <var>version</var> is the version number of GNU CC. 
This naming scheme permits various versions and/or cross-compilers to
coexist.  It also copies the executables for compilers for other
languages (e.g., <code>cc1plus</code> for C++) to the same directory.

<p>This also copies the driver program <code>xgcc</code> into
<code>/usr/local/bin/gcc</code>, so that it appears in typical execution
search paths.  It also copies <code>gcc.1</code> into
<code>/usr/local/man/man1</code> and info pages into <code>/usr/local/info</code>.

<p>On some systems, this command causes recompilation of some files.  This
is usually due to bugs in <code>make</code>.  You should either ignore this
problem, or use GNU Make.

<p><strong>Warning: there is a bug in <code>alloca</code> in the Sun library.  To
avoid this bug, be sure to install the executables of GNU CC that were
compiled by GNU CC.  (That is, the executables from stage 2 or 3, not
stage 1.)  They use <code>alloca</code> as a built-in function and never the
one in the library.</strong>

<p>(It is usually better to install GNU CC executables from stage 2 or 3,
since they usually run faster than the ones compiled with some other
compiler.)

</p><li>If you're going to use C++, you need to install the C++ runtime library. 
This includes all I/O functionality, special class libraries, etc.

<p>The standard C++ runtime library for GNU CC is called <code>libstdc++</code>. 
An obsolescent library <code>libg++</code> may also be available, but it's
necessary only for older software that hasn't been converted yet; if
you don't know whether you need <code>libg++</code> then you probably don't
need it.

<p>Here's one way to build and install <code>libstdc++</code> for GNU CC:

<ul>
<li>Build and install GNU CC, so that invoking <code>gcc</code> obtains the GNU CC
that was just built.

<li>Obtain a copy of a compatible <code>libstdc++</code> distribution.  For
example, the <code>libstdc++-2.8.0.tar.gz</code> distribution should be
compatible with GCC 2.8.0.  GCC distributors normally distribute
<code>libstdc++</code> as well.

<li>Set the <code>CXX</code> environment variable to <code>gcc</code> while running the
<code>libstdc++</code> distribution's <code>configure</code> command.  Use the same
<code>configure</code> options that you used when you invoked GCC's
<code>configure</code> command.

<li>Invoke <code>make</code> to build the C++ runtime.

<li>Invoke <code>make install</code> to install the C++ runtime.

</ul>

<p>To summarize, after building and installing GNU CC, invoke the following
shell commands in the topmost directory of the C++ library distribution. 
For <var>configure-options</var>, use the same options that
you used to configure GNU CC.

<pre>$ CXX=gcc ./configure <var>configure-options</var>
$ make
$ make install
</pre>

</p><li>GNU CC includes a runtime library for Objective-C because it is an
integral part of the language.  You can find the files associated with
the library in the subdirectory <code>objc</code>.  The GNU Objective-C
Runtime Library requires header files for the target's C library in
order to be compiled,and also requires the header files for the target's
thread library if you want thread support.  See <a href="#Cross%20Headers">Cross-Compilers and Header Files</a>, for
discussion about header files issues for cross-compilation.

<p>When you run <code>configure</code>, it picks the appropriate Objective-C
thread implementation file for the target platform.  In some situations,
you may wish to choose a different back-end as some platforms support
multiple thread implementations or you may wish to disable thread
support completely.  You do this by specifying a value for the
<var>OBJC_THREAD_FILE</var> makefile variable on the command line when you
run make, for example:

<pre>make CC="stage2/xgcc -Bstage2/" CFLAGS="-g -O2" OBJC_THREAD_FILE=thr-single
</pre>

<p>Below is a list of the currently available back-ends.

<ul>
<li>thr-single
Disable thread support, should work for all platforms. 
<li>thr-decosf1
DEC OSF/1 thread support. 
<li>thr-irix
SGI IRIX thread support. 
<li>thr-mach
Generic MACH thread support, known to work on NEXTSTEP. 
<li>thr-os2
IBM OS/2 thread support. 
<li>thr-posix
Generix POSIX thread support. 
<li>thr-pthreads
PCThreads on Linux-based GNU systems. 
<li>thr-solaris
SUN Solaris thread support. 
<li>thr-win32
Microsoft Win32 API thread support. 
</ul>

<h2>Files Created by <code>configure</code></h2>

<p>Here we spell out what files will be set up by <code>configure</code>.  Normally
you need not be concerned with these files.

<ul>
<li>A file named <code>config.h</code> is created that contains a <code>#include</code>
of the top-level config file for the machine you will run the compiler
on (see <a href="#Config">Config</a>).  This file is responsible for defining information
about the host machine.  It includes <code>tm.h</code>.

<p>The top-level config file is located in the subdirectory <code>config</code>. 
Its name is always <code>xm-<var>something</var>.h</code>; usually
<code>xm-<var>machine</var>.h</code>, but there are some exceptions.

<p>If your system does not support symbolic links, you might want to
set up <code>config.h</code> to contain a <code>#include</code> command which
refers to the appropriate file.

</p><li>A file named <code>tconfig.h</code> is created which includes the top-level config
file for your target machine.  This is used for compiling certain
programs to run on that machine.

<li>A file named <code>tm.h</code> is created which includes the
machine-description macro file for your target machine.  It should be in
the subdirectory <code>config</code> and its name is often
<code><var>machine</var>.h</code>.

<li>The command file <code>configure</code> also constructs the file
<code>Makefile</code> by adding some text to the template file
<code>Makefile.in</code>.  The additional text comes from files in the
<code>config</code> directory, named <code>t-<var>target</var></code> and
<code>x-<var>host</var></code>.  If these files do not exist, it means nothing
needs to be added for a given target or host. 
</ul>

<h2>Configurations Supported by GNU CC</h2>

<p>Here are the possible CPU types:

<blockquote>
1750a, a29k, alpha, arm, c<var>n</var>, clipper, dsp16xx, elxsi, h8300,
hppa1.0, hppa1.1, i370, i386, i486, i586, i860, i960, m32r, m68000, m68k,
m88k, mips, mipsel, mips64, mips64el, ns32k, powerpc, powerpcle,
pyramid, romp, rs6000, sh, sparc, sparclite, sparc64, vax, we32k. 
</blockquote>

<p>Here are the recognized company names.  As you can see, customary
abbreviations are used rather than the longer official names.

<blockquote>
acorn, alliant, altos, apollo, apple, att, bull,
cbm, convergent, convex, crds, dec, dg, dolphin,
elxsi, encore, harris, hitachi, hp, ibm, intergraph, isi,
mips, motorola, ncr, next, ns, omron, plexus,
sequent, sgi, sony, sun, tti, unicom, wrs. 
</blockquote>

<p>The company name is meaningful only to disambiguate when the rest of
the information supplied is insufficient.  You can omit it, writing
just <code><var>cpu</var>-<var>system</var></code>, if it is not needed.  For example,
<code>vax-ultrix4.2</code> is equivalent to <code>vax-dec-ultrix4.2</code>.

<p>Here is a list of system types:

<blockquote>
386bsd, aix, acis, amigaos, aos, aout, aux, bosx, bsd, clix, coff, ctix, cxux,
dgux, dynix, ebmon, ecoff, elf, esix, freebsd, hms, genix, gnu, linux-gnu,
hiux, hpux, iris, irix, isc, luna, lynxos, mach, minix, msdos, mvs,
netbsd, newsos, nindy, ns, osf, osfrose, ptx, riscix, riscos, rtu, sco, sim,
solaris, sunos, sym, sysv, udi, ultrix, unicos, uniplus, unos, vms, vsta,
vxworks, winnt, xenix. 
</blockquote>

<p>You can omit the system type; then <code>configure</code> guesses the
operating system from the CPU and company.

<p>You can add a version number to the system type; this may or may not
make a difference.  For example, you can write <code>bsd4.3</code> or
<code>bsd4.4</code> to distinguish versions of BSD.  In practice, the version
number is most needed for <code>sysv3</code> and <code>sysv4</code>, which are often
treated differently.

<p>If you specify an impossible combination such as <code>i860-dg-vms</code>,
then you may get an error message from <code>configure</code>, or it may
ignore part of the information and do the best it can with the rest. 
<code>configure</code> always prints the canonical name for the alternative
that it used.  GNU CC does not support all possible alternatives.

<p>Often a particular model of machine has a name.  Many machine names are
recognized as aliases for CPU/company combinations.  Thus, the machine
name <code>sun3</code>, mentioned above, is an alias for <code>m68k-sun</code>. 
Sometimes we accept a company name as a machine name, when the name is
popularly used for a particular machine.  Here is a table of the known
machine names:

<blockquote>
3300, 3b1, 3b<var>n</var>, 7300, altos3068, altos,
apollo68, att-7300, balance,
convex-c<var>n</var>, crds, decstation-3100,
decstation, delta, encore,
fx2800, gmicro, hp7<var>nn</var>, hp8<var>nn</var>,
hp9k2<var>nn</var>, hp9k3<var>nn</var>, hp9k7<var>nn</var>,
hp9k8<var>nn</var>, iris4d, iris, isi68,
m3230, magnum, merlin, miniframe,
mmax, news-3600, news800, news, next,
pbd, pc532, pmax, powerpc, powerpcle, ps2, risc-news,
rtpc, sun2, sun386i, sun386, sun3,
sun4, symmetry, tower-32, tower. 
</blockquote>

<p>Remember that a machine name specifies both the cpu type and the company
name. 
If you want to install your own homemade configuration files, you can
use <code>local</code> as the company name to access them.  If you use
configuration <code><var>cpu</var>-local</code>, the configuration name
without the cpu prefix
is used to form the configuration file names.

<p>Thus, if you specify <code>m68k-local</code>, configuration uses
files <code>m68k.md</code>, <code>local.h</code>, <code>m68k.c</code>,
<code>xm-local.h</code>, <code>t-local</code>, and <code>x-local</code>, all in the
directory <code>config/m68k</code>.

<p>Here is a list of configurations that have special treatment or special
things you must know:

<dl>
<dt><code>1750a-*-*</code>
<dd>MIL-STD-1750A processors.

<p>The MIL-STD-1750A cross configuration produces output for
<code>as1750</code>, an assembler/linker available under the GNU Public
License for the 1750A. <code>as1750</code> can be obtained at
<em>ftp://ftp.fta-berlin.de/pub/crossgcc/1750gals/</em>. 
A similarly licensed simulator for
the 1750A is available from same address.

<p>You should ignore a fatal error during the building of libgcc (libgcc is
not yet implemented for the 1750A.)

<p>The <code>as1750</code> assembler requires the file <code>ms1750.inc</code>, which is
found in the directory <code>config/1750a</code>.

<p>GNU CC produced the same sections as the Fairchild F9450 C Compiler,
namely:

<dl>
<dt><code>Normal</code>
<dd>The program code section.

<br><dt><code>Static</code>
<dd>The read/write (RAM) data section.

<br><dt><code>Konst</code>
<dd>The read-only (ROM) constants section.

<br><dt><code>Init</code>
<dd>Initialization section (code to copy KREL to SREL). 
</dl>

<p>The smallest addressable unit is 16 bits (BITS_PER_UNIT is 16).  This
means that type `char' is represented with a 16-bit word per character. 
The 1750A's "Load/Store Upper/Lower Byte" instructions are not used by
GNU CC.

<br><dt><code>alpha-*-osf1</code>
<dd>Systems using processors that implement the DEC Alpha architecture and
are running the DEC Unix (OSF/1) operating system, for example the DEC
Alpha AXP systems.CC.)

<p>GNU CC writes a <code>.verstamp</code> directive to the assembler output file
unless it is built as a cross-compiler.  It gets the version to use from
the system header file <code>/usr/include/stamp.h</code>.  If you install a
new version of DEC Unix, you should rebuild GCC to pick up the new version
stamp.

<p>Note that since the Alpha is a 64-bit architecture, cross-compilers from
32-bit machines will not generate code as efficient as that generated
when the compiler is running on a 64-bit machine because many
optimizations that depend on being able to represent a word on the
target in an integral value on the host cannot be performed.  Building
cross-compilers on the Alpha for 32-bit machines has only been tested in
a few cases and may not work properly.

<p><code>make compare</code> may fail on old versions of DEC Unix unless you add
<code>-save-temps</code> to <code>CFLAGS</code>.  On these systems, the name of the
assembler input file is stored in the object file, and that makes
comparison fail if it differs between the <code>stage1</code> and
<code>stage2</code> compilations.  The option <code>-save-temps</code> forces a
fixed name to be used for the assembler input file, instead of a
randomly chosen name in <code>/tmp</code>.  Do not add <code>-save-temps</code>
unless the comparisons fail without that option.  If you add
<code>-save-temps</code>, you will have to manually delete the <code>.i</code> and
<code>.s</code> files after each series of compilations.

<p>GNU CC now supports both the native (ECOFF) debugging format used by DBX
and GDB and an encapsulated STABS format for use only with GDB.  See the
discussion of the <code>--with-stabs</code> option of <code>configure</code> above
for more information on these formats and how to select them.

<p>There is a bug in DEC's assembler that produces incorrect line numbers
for ECOFF format when the <code>.align</code> directive is used.  To work
around this problem, GNU CC will not emit such alignment directives
while writing ECOFF format debugging information even if optimization is
being performed.  Unfortunately, this has the very undesirable
side-effect that code addresses when <code>-O</code> is specified are
different depending on whether or not <code>-g</code> is also specified.

<p>To avoid this behavior, specify <code>-gstabs+</code> and use GDB instead of
DBX.  DEC is now aware of this problem with the assembler and hopes to
provide a fix shortly.

<br><dt><code>arc-*-elf</code>
<dd>Argonaut ARC processor. 
This configuration is intended for embedded systems.

<br><dt><code>arm-*-aout</code>
<dd>Advanced RISC Machines ARM-family processors.  These are often used in
embedded applications.  There are no standard Unix configurations. 
This configuration corresponds to the basic instruction sequences and will
produce <code>a.out</code> format object modules.

<p>You may need to make a variant of the file <code>arm.h</code> for your particular
configuration.

<br><dt><code>arm-*-linuxaout</code>
<dd>Any of the ARM family processors running the Linux-based GNU system with
the <code>a.out</code> binary format (ELF is not yet supported).  You must use
version 2.8.1.0.7 or later of the GNU/Linux binutils, which you can download
from <code>sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/GCC</code> and other mirror sites for
Linux-based GNU systems.

<br><dt><code>arm-*-riscix</code>
<dd>The ARM2 or ARM3 processor running RISC iX, Acorn's port of BSD Unix. 
If you are running a version of RISC iX prior to 1.2 then you must
specify the version number during configuration.  Note that the
assembler shipped with RISC iX does not support stabs debugging
information; a new version of the assembler, with stabs support
included, is now available from Acorn and via ftp
<code>ftp.acorn.com:/pub/riscix/as+xterm.tar.Z</code>.  To enable stabs
debugging, pass <code>--with-gnu-as</code> to configure.

<p>You will need to install GNU <code>sed</code> before you can run configure.

<br><dt><code>a29k</code>
<dd>AMD Am29k-family processors.  These are normally used in embedded
applications.  There are no standard Unix configurations. 
This configuration
corresponds to AMD's standard calling sequence and binary interface
and is compatible with other 29k tools.

<p>You may need to make a variant of the file <code>a29k.h</code> for your
particular configuration.

<br><dt><code>a29k-*-bsd</code>
<dd>AMD Am29050 used in a system running a variant of BSD Unix.

<br><dt><code>decstation-*</code>
<dd>MIPS-based DECstations can support three different personalities:
Ultrix, DEC OSF/1, and OSF/rose.  (Alpha-based DECstation products have
a configuration name beginning with <code>alpha-dec</code>.)  To configure GCC
for these platforms use the following configurations:

<dl>
<dt><code>decstation-ultrix</code>
<dd>Ultrix configuration.

<br><dt><code>decstation-osf1</code>
<dd>Dec's version of OSF/1.

<br><dt><code>decstation-osfrose</code>
<dd>Open Software Foundation reference port of OSF/1 which uses the
OSF/rose object file format instead of ECOFF.  Normally, you
would not select this configuration. 
</dl>

<p>The MIPS C compiler needs to be told to increase its table size
for switch statements with the <code>-Wf,-XNg1500</code> option in
order to compile <code>cp/parse.c</code>.  If you use the <code>-O2</code>
optimization option, you also need to use <code>-Olimit 3000</code>. 
Both of these options are automatically generated in the
<code>Makefile</code> that the shell script <code>configure</code> builds. 
If you override the <code>CC</code> make variable and use the MIPS
compilers, you may need to add <code>-Wf,-XNg1500 -Olimit 3000</code>.

<br><dt><code>elxsi-elxsi-bsd</code>
<dd>The Elxsi's C compiler has known limitations that prevent it from
compiling GNU C.  Please contact <code>mrs@cygnus.com</code> for more details.

<br><dt><code>dsp16xx</code>
<dd>A port to the AT&amp;T DSP1610 family of processors.

<br><dt><code>h8300-*-*</code>
<dd>Hitachi H8/300 series of processors.

<p>The calling convention and structure layout has changed in release 2.6. 
All code must be recompiled.  The calling convention now passes the
first three arguments in function calls in registers.  Structures are no
longer a multiple of 2 bytes.

<br><dt><code>hppa*-*-*</code>
<dd>There are several variants of the HP-PA processor which run a variety
of operating systems.  GNU CC must be configured to use the correct
processor type and operating system, or GNU CC will not function correctly. 
The easiest way to handle this problem is to <em>not</em> specify a target
when configuring GNU CC, the <code>configure</code> script will try to automatically
determine the right processor type and operating system.

<p><code>-g</code> does not work on HP-UX, since that system uses a peculiar
debugging format which GNU CC does not know about.  However, <code>-g</code>
will work if you also use GAS and GDB in conjunction with GCC.  We
highly recommend using GAS for all HP-PA configurations.

<p>You should be using GAS-2.6 (or later) along with GDB-4.16 (or later).  These
can be retrieved from all the traditional GNU ftp archive sites.

<p>On some versions of HP-UX, you will need to install GNU <code>sed</code>.

<p>You will need to be install GAS into a directory before <code>/bin</code>,
<code>/usr/bin</code>, and <code>/usr/ccs/bin</code> in your search path.  You
should install GAS before you build GNU CC.

<p>To enable debugging, you must configure GNU CC with the <code>--with-gnu-as</code>
option before building.

<br><dt><code>i370-*-*</code>
<dd>This port is very preliminary and has many known bugs.  We hope to
have a higher-quality port for this machine soon.

<br><dt><code>i386-*-linux-gnuoldld</code>
<dd>Use this configuration to generate <code>a.out</code> binaries on Linux-based
GNU systems if you do not have gas/binutils version 2.5.2 or later
installed. This is an obsolete configuration.

<br><dt><code>i386-*-linux-gnuaout</code>
<dd>Use this configuration to generate <code>a.out</code> binaries on Linux-based
GNU systems. This configuration is being superseded. You must use
gas/binutils version 2.5.2 or later.

<br><dt><code>i386-*-linux-gnu</code>
<dd>Use this configuration to generate ELF binaries on Linux-based GNU
systems.  You must use gas/binutils version 2.5.2 or later.

<br><dt><code>i386-*-sco</code>
<dd>Compilation with RCC is recommended.  Also, it may be a good idea to
link with GNU malloc instead of the malloc that comes with the system.

<br><dt><code>i386-*-sco3.2v4</code>
<dd>Use this configuration for SCO release 3.2 version 4.

<br><dt><code>i386-*-sco3.2v5*</code>
<dd>Use this for the SCO OpenServer Release family including 5.0.0, 5.0.2,
5.0.4, 5.0.5, Internet FastStart 1.0, and Internet FastStart 1.1.

<p>GNU CC can generate COFF binaries if you specify <code>-mcoff</code> or ELF
binaries, the default.    A full <code>make bootstrap</code> is recommended
so that an ELF compiler that builds ELF is generated.

<p>You must have TLS597 from <a href="ftp://ftp.sco.com/TLS">ftp://ftp.sco.com/TLS</a> installed for ELF
C++ binaries to work correctly on releases before 5.0.4.

<p>The native SCO assembler that is provided with the OS at no charge
is normally required.  If, however, you must be able to use the GNU
assembler (perhaps you have complex asms) you must configure this
package <code>--with-gnu-as</code>.  To do this, install (cp or symlink)
gcc/as to your copy of the GNU assembler.  You must use a recent version
of GNU binutils; version 2.9.1 seems to work well.  If you select this
option, you will be unable to build COFF images.  Trying to do so will
result in non-obvious failures.  In general, the "-with-gnu-as" option
isn't as well tested as the native assembler.

<p><em>NOTE:</em> If you are building C++, you must follow the instructions
about invoking <code>make bootstrap</code> because the native OpenServer
compiler may build a <code>cc1plus</code> that will not correctly parse many
valid C++ programs.  You must do a <code>make bootstrap</code> if you are
building with the native compiler.

<br><dt><code>i386-*-isc</code>
<dd>It may be a good idea to link with GNU malloc instead of the malloc that
comes with the system.

<p>In ISC version 4.1, <code>sed</code> core dumps when building
<code>deduced.h</code>.  Use the version of <code>sed</code> from version 4.0.

<br><dt><code>i386-*-esix</code>
<dd>It may be good idea to link with GNU malloc instead of the malloc that
comes with the system.

<br><dt><code>i386-ibm-aix</code>
<dd>You need to use GAS version 2.1 or later, and LD from
GNU binutils version 2.2 or later.

<br><dt><code>i386-sequent-bsd</code>
<dd>Go to the Berkeley universe before compiling.

<br><dt><code>i386-sequent-ptx1*</code>
<dt><code>i386-sequent-ptx2*</code>
<dd>You must install GNU <code>sed</code> before running <code>configure</code>.

<br><dt><code>i386-sun-sunos4</code>
<dd>You may find that you need another version of GNU CC to begin
bootstrapping with, since the current version when built with the
system's own compiler seems to get an infinite loop compiling part of
<code>libgcc2.c</code>.  GNU CC version 2 compiled with GNU CC (any version)
seems not to have this problem.

<p>See <a href="#Sun%20Install">Sun Install</a>, for information on installing GNU CC on Sun
systems.

<br><dt><code>i[345]86-*-winnt3.5</code>
<dd>This version requires a GAS that has not yet been released.  Until it
is, you can get a prebuilt binary version via anonymous ftp from
<code>cs.washington.edu:pub/gnat</code> or <code>cs.nyu.edu:pub/gnat</code>. You
must also use the Microsoft header files from the Windows NT 3.5 SDK. 
Find these on the CDROM in the <code>/mstools/h</code> directory dated 9/4/94.  You
must use a fixed version of Microsoft linker made especially for NT 3.5,
which is also is available on the NT 3.5 SDK CDROM.  If you do not have
this linker, can you also use the linker from Visual C/C++ 1.0 or 2.0.

<p>Installing GNU CC for NT builds a wrapper linker, called <code>ld.exe</code>,
which mimics the behaviour of Unix <code>ld</code> in the specification of
libraries (<code>-L</code> and <code>-l</code>).  <code>ld.exe</code> looks for both Unix
and Microsoft named libraries.  For example, if you specify
<code>-lfoo</code>, <code>ld.exe</code> will look first for <code>libfoo.a</code>
and then for <code>foo.lib</code>.

<p>You may install GNU CC for Windows NT in one of two ways, depending on
whether or not you have a Unix-like shell and various Unix-like
utilities.

<ol type=1 start=1>
</p><li>If you do not have a Unix-like shell and few Unix-like utilities, you
will use a DOS style batch script called <code>configure.bat</code>.  Invoke
it as <code>configure winnt</code> from an MSDOS console window or from the
program manager dialog box.  <code>configure.bat</code> assumes you have
already installed and have in your path a Unix-like <code>sed</code> program
which is used to create a working <code>Makefile</code> from <code>Makefile.in</code>.

<p><code>Makefile</code> uses the Microsoft Nmake program maintenance utility and
the Visual C/C++ V8.00 compiler to build GNU CC.  You need only have the
utilities <code>sed</code> and <code>touch</code> to use this installation method,
which only automatically builds the compiler itself.  You must then
examine what <code>fixinc.winnt</code> does, edit the header files by hand and
build <code>libgcc.a</code> manually.

<li>The second type of installation assumes you are running a Unix-like
shell, have a complete suite of Unix-like utilities in your path, and
have a previous version of GNU CC already installed, either through
building it via the above installation method or acquiring a pre-built
binary.  In this case, use the <code>configure</code> script in the normal
fashion.
</ol>

<br><dt><code>i860-intel-osf1</code>
<dd>This is the Paragon. 
If you have version 1.0 of the operating system,
see <a href="#Installation%20Problems">Installation Problems</a>, for special things you need to do to
compensate for peculiarities in the system.

<br><dt><code>*-lynx-lynxos</code>
<dd>LynxOS 2.2 and earlier comes with GNU CC 1.x already installed as
<code>/bin/gcc</code>.  You should compile with this instead of <code>/bin/cc</code>. 
You can tell GNU CC to use the GNU assembler and linker, by specifying
<code>--with-gnu-as --with-gnu-ld</code> when configuring.  These will produce
COFF format object files and executables;  otherwise GNU CC will use the
installed tools, which produce <code>a.out</code> format executables.

<br><dt><code>m32r-*-elf</code>
<dd>Mitsubishi M32R processor. 
This configuration is intended for embedded systems.

<br><dt><code>m68000-hp-bsd</code>
<dd>HP 9000 series 200 running BSD.  Note that the C compiler that comes
with this system cannot compile GNU CC; contact <code>law@cygnus.com</code>
to get binaries of GNU CC for bootstrapping.

<br><dt><code>m68k-altos</code>
<dd>Altos 3068.  You must use the GNU assembler, linker and debugger. 
Also, you must fix a kernel bug.  Details in the file <code>README.ALTOS</code>.

<br><dt><code>m68k-apple-aux</code>
<dd>Apple Macintosh running A/UX. 
You may configure GCC  to use either the system assembler and
linker or the GNU assembler and linker.  You should use the GNU configuration
if you can, especially if you also want to use GNU C++.  You enabled
that configuration with + the <code>--with-gnu-as</code> and <code>--with-gnu-ld</code>
options to <code>configure</code>.

<p>Note the C compiler that comes
with this system cannot compile GNU CC.  You can find binaries of GNU CC
for bootstrapping on <code>jagubox.gsfc.nasa.gov</code>. 
You will also a patched version of <code>/bin/ld</code> there that
raises some of the arbitrary limits found in the original.

<br><dt><code>m68k-att-sysv</code>
<dd>AT&amp;T 3b1, a.k.a. 7300 PC.  Special procedures are needed to compile GNU
CC with this machine's standard C compiler, due to bugs in that
compiler.  You can bootstrap it more easily with
previous versions of GNU CC if you have them.

<p>Installing GNU CC on the 3b1 is difficult if you do not already have
GNU CC running, due to bugs in the installed C compiler.  However,
the following procedure might work.  We are unable to test it.

<ol type=1 start=1>
</p><li>Comment out the <code>#include "config.h"</code> line near the start of
<code>cccp.c</code> and do <code>make cpp</code>.  This makes a preliminary version
of GNU cpp.

<li>Save the old <code>/lib/cpp</code> and copy the preliminary GNU cpp to that
file name.

<li>Undo your change in <code>cccp.c</code>, or reinstall the original version,
and do <code>make cpp</code> again.

<li>Copy this final version of GNU cpp into <code>/lib/cpp</code>.

<li>Replace every occurrence of <code>obstack_free</code> in the file
<code>tree.c</code> with <code>_obstack_free</code>.

<li>Run <code>make</code> to get the first-stage GNU CC.

<li>Reinstall the original version of <code>/lib/cpp</code>.

<li>Now you can compile GNU CC with itself and install it in the normal
fashion.
</ol>

<br><dt><code>m68k-bull-sysv</code>
<dd>Bull DPX/2 series 200 and 300 with BOS-2.00.45 up to BOS-2.01. GNU CC works
either with native assembler or GNU assembler. You can use
GNU assembler with native coff generation by providing <code>--with-gnu-as</code> to
the configure script or use GNU assembler with dbx-in-coff encapsulation
by providing <code>--with-gnu-as --stabs</code>. For any problem with native
assembler or for availability of the DPX/2 port of GAS, contact
<code>F.Pierresteguy@frcl.bull.fr</code>.

<br><dt><code>m68k-crds-unox</code>
<dd>Use <code>configure unos</code> for building on Unos.

<p>The Unos assembler is named <code>casm</code> instead of <code>as</code>.  For some
strange reason linking <code>/bin/as</code> to <code>/bin/casm</code> changes the
behavior, and does not work.  So, when installing GNU CC, you should
install the following script as <code>as</code> in the subdirectory where
the passes of GCC are installed:

<pre>#!/bin/sh
casm $*
</pre>

<p>The default Unos library is named <code>libunos.a</code> instead of
<code>libc.a</code>.  To allow GNU CC to function, either change all
references to <code>-lc</code> in <code>gcc.c</code> to <code>-lunos</code> or link
<code>/lib/libc.a</code> to <code>/lib/libunos.a</code>.

<p>When compiling GNU CC with the standard compiler, to overcome bugs in
the support of <code>alloca</code>, do not use <code>-O</code> when making stage 2. 
Then use the stage 2 compiler with <code>-O</code> to make the stage 3
compiler.  This compiler will have the same characteristics as the usual
stage 2 compiler on other systems.  Use it to make a stage 4 compiler
and compare that with stage 3 to verify proper compilation.

<p>(Perhaps simply defining <code>ALLOCA</code> in <code>x-crds</code> as described in
the comments there will make the above paragraph superfluous.  Please
inform us of whether this works.)

<p>Unos uses memory segmentation instead of demand paging, so you will need
a lot of memory.  5 Mb is barely enough if no other tasks are running. 
If linking <code>cc1</code> fails, try putting the object files into a library
and linking from that library.

<br><dt><code>m68k-hp-hpux</code>
<dd>HP 9000 series 300 or 400 running HP-UX.  HP-UX version 8.0 has a bug in
the assembler that prevents compilation of GNU CC.  To fix it, get patch
PHCO_4484 from HP.

<p>In addition, if you wish to use gas <code>--with-gnu-as</code> you must use
gas version 2.1 or later, and you must use the GNU linker version 2.1 or
later.  Earlier versions of gas relied upon a program which converted the
gas output into the native HP-UX format, but that program has not been
kept up to date.  gdb does not understand that native HP-UX format, so
you must use gas if you wish to use gdb.

<br><dt><code>m68k-sun</code>
<dd>Sun 3.  We do not provide a configuration file to use the Sun FPA by
default, because programs that establish signal handlers for floating
point traps inherently cannot work with the FPA.

<p>See <a href="#Sun%20Install">Sun Install</a>, for information on installing GNU CC on Sun
systems.

<br><dt><code>m88k-*-svr3</code>
<dd>Motorola m88k running the AT&amp;T/Unisoft/Motorola V.3 reference port. 
These systems tend to use the Green Hills C, revision 1.8.5, as the
standard C compiler.  There are apparently bugs in this compiler that
result in object files differences between stage 2 and stage 3.  If this
happens, make the stage 4 compiler and compare it to the stage 3
compiler.  If the stage 3 and stage 4 object files are identical, this
suggests you encountered a problem with the standard C compiler; the
stage 3 and 4 compilers may be usable.

<p>It is best, however, to use an older version of GNU CC for bootstrapping
if you have one.

<br><dt><code>m88k-*-dgux</code>
<dd>Motorola m88k running DG/UX.  To build 88open BCS native or cross
compilers on DG/UX, specify the configuration name as
<code>m88k-*-dguxbcs</code> and build in the 88open BCS software development
environment.  To build ELF native or cross compilers on DG/UX, specify
<code>m88k-*-dgux</code> and build in the DG/UX ELF development environment. 
You set the software development environment by issuing
<code>sde-target</code> command and specifying either <code>m88kbcs</code> or
<code>m88kdguxelf</code> as the operand.

<p>If you do not specify a configuration name, <code>configure</code> guesses the
configuration based on the current software development environment.

<br><dt><code>m88k-tektronix-sysv3</code>
<dd>Tektronix XD88 running UTekV 3.2e.  Do not turn on
optimization while building stage1 if you bootstrap with
the buggy Green Hills compiler.  Also, The bundled LAI
System V NFS is buggy so if you build in an NFS mounted
directory, start from a fresh reboot, or avoid NFS all together. 
Otherwise you may have trouble getting clean comparisons
between stages.

<br><dt><code>mips-mips-bsd</code>
<dd>MIPS machines running the MIPS operating system in BSD mode.  It's
possible that some old versions of the system lack the functions
<code>memcpy</code>, <code>memcmp</code>, and <code>memset</code>.  If your system lacks
these, you must remove or undo the definition of
<code>TARGET_MEM_FUNCTIONS</code> in <code>mips-bsd.h</code>.

<p>The MIPS C compiler needs to be told to increase its table size
for switch statements with the <code>-Wf,-XNg1500</code> option in
order to compile <code>cp/parse.c</code>.  If you use the <code>-O2</code>
optimization option, you also need to use <code>-Olimit 3000</code>. 
Both of these options are automatically generated in the
<code>Makefile</code> that the shell script <code>configure</code> builds. 
If you override the <code>CC</code> make variable and use the MIPS
compilers, you may need to add <code>-Wf,-XNg1500 -Olimit 3000</code>.

<br><dt><code>mips-mips-riscos*</code>
<dd>The MIPS C compiler needs to be told to increase its table size
for switch statements with the <code>-Wf,-XNg1500</code> option in
order to compile <code>cp/parse.c</code>.  If you use the <code>-O2</code>
optimization option, you also need to use <code>-Olimit 3000</code>. 
Both of these options are automatically generated in the
<code>Makefile</code> that the shell script <code>configure</code> builds. 
If you override the <code>CC</code> make variable and use the MIPS
compilers, you may need to add <code>-Wf,-XNg1500 -Olimit 3000</code>.

<p>MIPS computers running RISC-OS can support four different
personalities: default, BSD 4.3, System V.3, and System V.4
(older versions of RISC-OS don't support V.4).  To configure GCC
for these platforms use the following configurations:

<dl>
<dt><code>mips-mips-riscos<code>rev</code></code>
<dd>Default configuration for RISC-OS, revision <code>rev</code>.

<br><dt><code>mips-mips-riscos<code>rev</code>bsd</code>
<dd>BSD 4.3 configuration for RISC-OS, revision <code>rev</code>.

<br><dt><code>mips-mips-riscos<code>rev</code>sysv4</code>
<dd>System V.4 configuration for RISC-OS, revision <code>rev</code>.

<br><dt><code>mips-mips-riscos<code>rev</code>sysv</code>
<dd>System V.3 configuration for RISC-OS, revision <code>rev</code>. 
</dl>

<p>The revision <code>rev</code> mentioned above is the revision of
RISC-OS to use.  You must reconfigure GCC when going from a
RISC-OS revision 4 to RISC-OS revision 5.  This has the effect of
avoiding a linker
bug (see <a href="#Installation%20Problems">Installation Problems</a>, for more details).

<br><dt><code>mips-sgi-*</code>
<dd>In order to compile GCC on an SGI running IRIX 4, the "c.hdr.lib"
option must be installed from the CD-ROM supplied from Silicon Graphics. 
This is found on the 2nd CD in release 4.0.1.

<p>In order to compile GCC on an SGI running IRIX 5, the "compiler_dev.hdr"
subsystem must be installed from the IDO CD-ROM supplied by Silicon
Graphics.

<p><code>make compare</code> may fail on version 5 of IRIX unless you add
<code>-save-temps</code> to <code>CFLAGS</code>.  On these systems, the name of the
assembler input file is stored in the object file, and that makes
comparison fail if it differs between the <code>stage1</code> and
<code>stage2</code> compilations.  The option <code>-save-temps</code> forces a
fixed name to be used for the assembler input file, instead of a
randomly chosen name in <code>/tmp</code>.  Do not add <code>-save-temps</code>
unless the comparisons fail without that option.  If you do you
<code>-save-temps</code>, you will have to manually delete the <code>.i</code> and
<code>.s</code> files after each series of compilations.

<p>The MIPS C compiler needs to be told to increase its table size
for switch statements with the <code>-Wf,-XNg1500</code> option in
order to compile <code>cp/parse.c</code>.  If you use the <code>-O2</code>
optimization option, you also need to use <code>-Olimit 3000</code>. 
Both of these options are automatically generated in the
<code>Makefile</code> that the shell script <code>configure</code> builds. 
If you override the <code>CC</code> make variable and use the MIPS
compilers, you may need to add <code>-Wf,-XNg1500 -Olimit 3000</code>.

<p>On Irix version 4.0.5F, and perhaps on some other versions as well,
there is an assembler bug that reorders instructions incorrectly.  To
work around it, specify the target configuration
<code>mips-sgi-irix4loser</code>.  This configuration inhibits assembler
optimization.

<p>In a compiler configured with target <code>mips-sgi-irix4</code>, you can turn
off assembler optimization by using the <code>-noasmopt</code> option.  This
compiler option passes the option <code>-O0</code> to the assembler, to
inhibit reordering.

<p>The <code>-noasmopt</code> option can be useful for testing whether a problem
is due to erroneous assembler reordering.  Even if a problem does not go
away with <code>-noasmopt</code>, it may still be due to assembler
reordering--perhaps GNU CC itself was miscompiled as a result.

<p>To enable debugging under Irix 5, you must use GNU as 2.5 or later,
and use the <code>--with-gnu-as</code> configure option when configuring gcc. 
GNU as is distributed as part of the binutils package.

<br><dt><code>mips-sony-sysv</code>
<dd>Sony MIPS NEWS.  This works in NEWSOS 5.0.1, but not in 5.0.2 (which
uses ELF instead of COFF).  Support for 5.0.2 will probably be provided
soon by volunteers.  In particular, the linker does not like the
code generated by GCC when shared libraries are linked in.

<br><dt><code>ns32k-encore</code>
<dd>Encore ns32000 system.  Encore systems are supported only under BSD.

<br><dt><code>ns32k-*-genix</code>

<br><dt><code>ns32k-utek</code>

system cannot compile GNU CC; contact <code>tektronix!reed!mason</code> to get
binaries of GNU CC for bootstrapping.

<br><dt><code>romp-*-aos</code>
<dt><code>romp-*-mach</code>
<dd>The only operating systems supported for the IBM RT PC are AOS and
MACH.  GNU CC does not support AIX running on the RT.  We recommend you
compile GNU CC with an earlier version of itself; if you compile GNU CC
with <code>hc</code>, the Metaware compiler, it will work, but you will get
mismatches between the stage 2 and stage 3 compilers in various files. 
These errors are minor differences in some floating-point constants and
can be safely ignored; the stage 3 compiler is correct.

<br><dt><code>rs6000-*-aix</code>
<dt><code>powerpc-*-aix</code>
<dd>Various early versions of each release of the IBM XLC compiler will not
bootstrap GNU CC.  Symptoms include differences between the stage2 and
stage3 object files, and errors when compiling <code>libgcc.a</code> or
<code>enquire</code>.  Known problematic releases include: xlc-1.2.1.8,
xlc-1.3.0.0 (distributed with AIX 3.2.5), and xlc-1.3.0.19.  Both
xlc-1.2.1.28 and xlc-1.3.0.24 (PTF 432238) are known to produce working
versions of GNU CC, but most other recent releases correctly bootstrap
GNU CC.

<p>Release 4.3.0 of AIX and ones prior to AIX 3.2.4 include a version of
the IBM assembler which does not accept debugging directives: assembler
updates are available as PTFs.  Also, if you are using AIX 3.2.5 or
greater and the GNU assembler, you must have a version modified after
October 16th, 1995 in order for the GNU C compiler to build.  See the
file <code>README.RS6000</code> for more details on any of these problems.

<p>GNU CC does not yet support the 64-bit PowerPC instructions.

<p>Objective C does not work on this architecture because it makes assumptions
that are incompatible with the calling conventions.

<p>AIX on the RS/6000 provides support (NLS) for environments outside of
the United States.  Compilers and assemblers use NLS to support
locale-specific representations of various objects including
floating-point numbers ("." vs "," for separating decimal fractions). 
There have been problems reported where the library linked with GNU CC
does not produce the same floating-point formats that the assembler
accepts.  If you have this problem, set the LANG environment variable to
"C" or "En_US".

<p>Due to changes in the way that GNU CC invokes the binder (linker) for AIX
4.1, you may now receive warnings of duplicate symbols from the link step
that were not reported before.  The assembly files generated by GNU CC for
AIX have always included multiple symbol definitions for certain global
variable and function declarations in the original program.  The warnings
should not prevent the linker from producing a correct library or runnable
executable.

<p>By default, AIX 4.1 produces code that can be used on either Power or
PowerPC processors.

<p>Don't use <code>-g</code> when compiling with the system's compiler.  The
system's linker seems to be unable to handle such a large program with
debugging information.

<p>The system's compiler runs out of capacity when compiling <code>stmt.c</code>
in GNU CC.  You can work around this by building <code>cpp</code> in GNU CC
first, then use that instead of the system's preprocessor with the
system's C compiler to compile <code>stmt.c</code>.  Here is how:

<pre>mv /lib/cpp /lib/cpp.att
cp cpp /lib/cpp.gnu
echo '/lib/cpp.gnu -traditional ${1+"$@"}' &gt; /lib/cpp
chmod +x /lib/cpp
</pre>

<p>The system's compiler produces bad code for some of the GNU CC
optimization files.  So you must build the stage 2 compiler without
optimization.  Then build a stage 3 compiler with optimization. 
That executable should work.  Here are the necessary commands:

<pre>make LANGUAGES=c CC=stage1/xgcc CFLAGS="-Bstage1/ -g"
make stage2
make CC=stage2/xgcc CFLAGS="-Bstage2/ -g -O"
</pre>

<p>You may need to raise the ULIMIT setting to build a C++ compiler,
as the file <code>cc1plus</code> is larger than one megabyte.

<h2>Compilation in a Separate Directory</h2>

<p>If you wish to build the object files and executables in a directory
other than the one containing the source files, here is what you must
do differently:

<ol type=1 start=1>
</p><li>Make sure you have a version of Make that supports the <code>VPATH</code>
feature.  (GNU Make supports it, as do Make versions on most BSD
systems.)

<li>If you have ever run <code>configure</code> in the source directory, you must undo
the configuration.  Do this by running:

<pre>make distclean
</pre>

<li>Go to the directory in which you want to build the compiler before
running <code>configure</code>:

<pre>mkdir gcc-sun3
cd gcc-sun3
</pre>

<p>On systems that do not support symbolic links, this directory must be
on the same file system as the source code directory.

</p><li>Specify where to find <code>configure</code> when you run it:

<pre>../gcc/configure <small>...</small>
</pre>

<p>This also tells <code>configure</code> where to find the compiler sources;
<code>configure</code> takes the directory from the file name that was used to
invoke it.  But if you want to be sure, you can specify the source
directory with the <code>--srcdir</code> option, like this:

<pre>../gcc/configure --srcdir=../gcc <var>other options</var>
</pre>

<p>The directory you specify with <code>--srcdir</code> need not be the same
as the one that <code>configure</code> is found in.
</ol>

<p>Now, you can run <code>make</code> in that directory.  You need not repeat the
configuration steps shown above, when ordinary source files change.  You
must, however, run <code>configure</code> again when the configuration files
change, if your system does not support symbolic links.

<h2>Building and Installing a Cross-Compiler</h2>

<p>GNU CC can function as a cross-compiler for many machines, but not all.

<ul>
<li>Cross-compilers for the Mips as target using the Mips assembler
currently do not work, because the auxiliary programs
<code>mips-tdump.c</code> and <code>mips-tfile.c</code> can't be compiled on
anything but a Mips.  It does work to cross compile for a Mips
if you use the GNU assembler and linker.

<li>Cross-compilers between machines with different floating point formats
have not all been made to work.  GNU CC now has a floating point
emulator with which these can work, but each target machine description
needs to be updated to take advantage of it.

<li>Cross-compilation between machines of different word sizes is
somewhat problematic and sometimes does not work. 
</ul>

<p>Since GNU CC generates assembler code, you probably need a
cross-assembler that GNU CC can run, in order to produce object files. 
If you want to link on other than the target machine, you need a
cross-linker as well.  You also need header files and libraries suitable
for the target machine that you can install on the host machine.

<li><a href="#Steps%20of%20Cross">Steps of Cross</a>:       Using a cross-compiler involves several steps

<h3>Steps of Cross-Compilation</h3>

<p>To compile and run a program using a cross-compiler involves several
steps:

<ul>
<li>Run the cross-compiler on the host machine to produce assembler files
for the target machine.  This requires header files for the target
machine.

<li>Assemble the files produced by the cross-compiler.  You can do this
either with an assembler on the target machine, or with a
cross-assembler on the host machine.

<li>Link those files to make an executable.  You can do this either with a
linker on the target machine, or with a cross-linker on the host
machine.  Whichever machine you use, you need libraries and certain
startup files (typically <code>crt<small>...</small>.o</code>) for the target machine. 
</ul>

<p>It is most convenient to do all of these steps on the same host machine,
since then you can do it all with a single invocation of GNU CC.  This
requires a suitable cross-assembler and cross-linker.  For some targets,
the GNU assembler and linker are available.

<h3>Configuring a Cross-Compiler</h3>

<p>To build GNU CC as a cross-compiler, you start out by running
<code>configure</code>.  Use the <code>--target=<var>target</var></code> to specify the
target type.  If <code>configure</code> was unable to correctly identify the
system you are running on, also specify the <code>--build=<var>build</var></code>
option.  For example, here is how to configure for a cross-compiler that
produces code for an HP 68030 system running BSD on a system that
<code>configure</code> can correctly identify:

<pre>./configure --target=m68k-hp-bsd4.3
</pre>

<p>If you have a cross-assembler and cross-linker available, you should
install them now.  Put them in the directory
<code>/usr/local/<var>target</var>/bin</code>.  Here is a table of the tools
you should put in this directory:

<dl>
<dt><code>as</code>
<dd>This should be the cross-assembler.

<br><dt><code>ld</code>
<dd>This should be the cross-linker.

<br><dt><code>ar</code>
<dd>This should be the cross-archiver: a program which can manipulate
archive files (linker libraries) in the target machine's format.

<br><dt><code>ranlib</code>
<dd>This should be a program to construct a symbol table in an archive file. 
</dl>

<p>The installation of GNU CC will find these programs in that directory,
and copy or link them to the proper place to for the cross-compiler to
find them when run later.

<p>The easiest way to provide these files is to build the Binutils package
and GAS.  Configure them with the same <code>--host</code> and <code>--target</code>
options that you use for configuring GNU CC, then build and install
them.  They install their executables automatically into the proper
directory.  Alas, they do not support all the targets that GNU CC
supports.

<p>If you want to install libraries to use with the cross-compiler, such as
a standard C library, put them in the directory
<code>/usr/local/<var>target</var>/lib</code>; installation of GNU CC copies
all the files in that subdirectory into the proper place for GNU CC to
find them and link with them.  Here's an example of copying some
libraries from a target machine:

<pre>ftp <var>target-machine</var>
lcd /usr/local/<var>target</var>/lib
cd /lib
get libc.a
cd /usr/lib
get libg.a
get libm.a
quit
</pre>

<p>The precise set of libraries you'll need, and their locations on
the target machine, vary depending on its operating system.

<p>Many targets require "start files" such as <code>crt0.o</code> and
<code>crtn.o</code> which are linked into each executable; these too should be
placed in <code>/usr/local/<var>target</var>/lib</code>.  There may be several
alternatives for <code>crt0.o</code>, for use with profiling or other
compilation options.  Check your target's definition of
<code>STARTFILE_SPEC</code> to find out what start files it uses. 
Here's an example of copying these files from a target machine:

<pre>ftp <var>target-machine</var>
lcd /usr/local/<var>target</var>/lib
prompt
cd /lib
mget *crt*.o
cd /usr/lib
mget *crt*.o
quit
</pre>

<h3><code>libgcc.a</code> and Cross-Compilers</h3>

<p>Code compiled by GNU CC uses certain runtime support functions
implicitly.  Some of these functions can be compiled successfully with
GNU CC itself, but a few cannot be.  These problem functions are in the
source file <code>libgcc1.c</code>; the library made from them is called
<code>libgcc1.a</code>.

<p>When you build a native compiler, these functions are compiled with some
other compiler-the one that you use for bootstrapping GNU CC. 
Presumably it knows how to open code these operations, or else knows how
to call the run-time emulation facilities that the machine comes with. 
But this approach doesn't work for building a cross-compiler.  The
compiler that you use for building knows about the host system, not the
target system.

<p>So, when you build a cross-compiler you have to supply a suitable
library <code>libgcc1.a</code> that does the job it is expected to do.

<p>To compile <code>libgcc1.c</code> with the cross-compiler itself does not
work.  The functions in this file are supposed to implement arithmetic
operations that GNU CC does not know how to open code for your target
machine.  If these functions are compiled with GNU CC itself, they
will compile into infinite recursion.

<p>On any given target, most of these functions are not needed.  If GNU CC
can open code an arithmetic operation, it will not call these functions
to perform the operation.  It is possible that on your target machine,
none of these functions is needed.  If so, you can supply an empty
library as <code>libgcc1.a</code>.

<p>Many targets need library support only for multiplication and division. 
If you are linking with a library that contains functions for
multiplication and division, you can tell GNU CC to call them directly
by defining the macros <code>MULSI3_LIBCALL</code>, and the like.  These
macros need to be defined in the target description macro file.  For
some targets, they are defined already.  This may be sufficient to
avoid the need for libgcc1.a; if so, you can supply an empty library.

<p>Some targets do not have floating point instructions; they need other
functions in <code>libgcc1.a</code>, which do floating arithmetic. 
Recent versions of GNU CC have a file which emulates floating point. 
With a certain amount of work, you should be able to construct a
floating point emulator that can be used as <code>libgcc1.a</code>.  Perhaps
future versions will contain code to do this automatically and
conveniently.  That depends on whether someone wants to implement it.

<p>Some embedded targets come with all the necessary <code>libgcc1.a</code>
routines written in C or assembler.  These targets build
<code>libgcc1.a</code> automatically and you do not need to do anything
special for them.  Other embedded targets do not need any
<code>libgcc1.a</code> routines since all the necessary operations are
supported by the hardware.

<p>If your target system has another C compiler, you can configure GNU CC
as a native compiler on that machine, build just <code>libgcc1.a</code> with
<code>make libgcc1.a</code> on that machine, and use the resulting file with
the cross-compiler.  To do this, execute the following on the target
machine:

<pre>cd <var>target-build-dir</var>
./configure --host=sparc --target=sun3
make libgcc1.a
</pre>

<p>And then this on the host machine:

<pre>ftp <var>target-machine</var>
binary
cd <var>target-build-dir</var>
get libgcc1.a
quit
</pre>

<p>Another way to provide the functions you need in <code>libgcc1.a</code> is to
define the appropriate <code>perform_<small>...</small></code> macros for those
functions.  If these definitions do not use the C arithmetic operators
that they are meant to implement, you should be able to compile them
with the cross-compiler you are building.  (If these definitions already
exist for your target file, then you are all set.)

<p>To build <code>libgcc1.a</code> using the perform macros, use
<code>LIBGCC1=libgcc1.a OLDCC=./xgcc</code> when building the compiler. 
Otherwise, you should place your replacement library under the name
<code>libgcc1.a</code> in the directory in which you will build the
cross-compiler, before you run <code>make</code>.

<h3>Cross-Compilers and Header Files</h3>

<p>If you are cross-compiling a standalone program or a program for an
embedded system, then you may not need any header files except the few
that are part of GNU CC (and those of your program).  However, if you
intend to link your program with a standard C library such as
<code>libc.a</code>, then you probably need to compile with the header files
that go with the library you use.

<p>The GNU C compiler does not come with these files, because (1) they are
system-specific, and (2) they belong in a C library, not in a compiler.

<p>If the GNU C library supports your target machine, then you can get the
header files from there (assuming you actually use the GNU library when
you link your program).

<p>If your target machine comes with a C compiler, it probably comes with
suitable header files also.  If you make these files accessible from the host
machine, the cross-compiler can use them also.

<p>Otherwise, you're on your own in finding header files to use when
cross-compiling.

<p>When you have found suitable header files, put them in the directory
<code>/usr/local/<var>target</var>/include</code>, before building the cross
compiler.  Then installation will run fixincludes properly and install
the corrected versions of the header files where the compiler will use
them.

<p>Provide the header files before you build the cross-compiler, because
the build stage actually runs the cross-compiler to produce parts of
<code>libgcc.a</code>.  (These are the parts that <em>can</em> be compiled with
GNU CC.)  Some of them need suitable header files.

<p>Here's an example showing how to copy the header files from a target
machine.  On the target machine, do this:

<pre>(cd /usr/include; tar cf - .) &gt; tarfile
</pre>

<p>Then, on the host machine, do this:

<pre>ftp <var>target-machine</var>
lcd /usr/local/<var>target</var>/include
get tarfile
quit
tar xf tarfile
</pre>

<br>

<h3>Actually Building the Cross-Compiler</h3>

<p>Now you can proceed just as for compiling a single-machine compiler
through the step of building stage 1.  If you have not provided some
sort of <code>libgcc1.a</code>, then compilation will give up at the point
where it needs that file, printing a suitable error message.  If you
do provide <code>libgcc1.a</code>, then building the compiler will automatically
compile and link a test program called <code>libgcc1-test</code>; if you get
errors in the linking, it means that not all of the necessary routines
in <code>libgcc1.a</code> are available.

<p>You must provide the header file <code>float.h</code>.  One way to do this is
to compile <code>enquire</code> and run it on your target machine.  The job of
<code>enquire</code> is to run on the target machine and figure out by
experiment the nature of its floating point representation. 
<code>enquire</code> records its findings in the header file <code>float.h</code>. 
If you can't produce this file by running <code>enquire</code> on the target
machine, then you will need to come up with a suitable <code>float.h</code> in
some other way (or else, avoid using it in your programs).

<p>Do not try to build stage 2 for a cross-compiler.  It doesn't work to
rebuild GNU CC as a cross-compiler using the cross-compiler, because
that would produce a program that runs on the target machine, not on the
host.  For example, if you compile a 386-to-68030 cross-compiler with
itself, the result will not be right either for the 386 (because it was
compiled into 68030 code) or for the 68030 (because it was configured
for a 386 as the host).  If you want to compile GNU CC into 68030 code,
whether you compile it on a 68030 or with a cross-compiler on a 386, you
must specify a 68030 as the host when you configure it.

<p>To install the cross-compiler, use <code>make install</code>, as usual.

<h2>Installing GNU CC on the Sun</h2>

<p>On Solaris, do not use the linker or other tools in
<code>/usr/ucb</code> to build GNU CC.  Use <code>/usr/ccs/bin</code>.

<p>If the assembler reports <code>Error: misaligned data</code> when bootstrapping,
you are probably using an obsolete version of the GNU assembler.  Upgrade
to the latest version of GNU <code>binutils</code>, or use the Solaris assembler.

<p>Make sure the environment variable <code>FLOAT_OPTION</code> is not set when
you compile <code>libgcc.a</code>.  If this option were set to <code>f68881</code>
when <code>libgcc.a</code> is compiled, the resulting code would demand to be
linked with a special startup file and would not link properly without
special pains.

<p>There is a bug in <code>alloca</code> in certain versions of the Sun library. 
To avoid this bug, install the binaries of GNU CC that were compiled by
GNU CC.  They use <code>alloca</code> as a built-in function and never the one
in the library.

<p>Some versions of the Sun compiler crash when compiling GNU CC.  The
problem is a segmentation fault in cpp.  This problem seems to be due to
the bulk of data in the environment variables.  You may be able to avoid
it by using the following command to compile GNU CC with Sun CC:

<pre>make CC="TERMCAP=x OBJS=x LIBFUNCS=x STAGESTUFF=x cc"
</pre>

<p>SunOS 4.1.3 and 4.1.3_U1 have bugs that can cause intermittent core
dumps when compiling GNU CC.  A common symptom is an
internal compiler error which does not recur if you run it again. 
To fix the problem, install Sun recommended patch 100726 (for SunOS 4.1.3)
or 101508 (for SunOS 4.1.3_U1), or upgrade to a later SunOS release.

<h2>Installing GNU CC on VMS</h2>

<p>The VMS version of GNU CC is distributed in a backup saveset containing
both source code and precompiled binaries.

<p>To install the <code>gcc</code> command so you can use the compiler easily, in
the same manner as you use the VMS C compiler, you must install the VMS CLD
file for GNU CC as follows:

<ol type=1 start=1>
</p><li>Define the VMS logical names <code>GNU_CC</code> and <code>GNU_CC_INCLUDE</code>
to point to the directories where the GNU CC executables
(<code>gcc-cpp.exe</code>, <code>gcc-cc1.exe</code>, etc.) and the C include files are
kept respectively.  This should be done with the commands:

<pre>$ assign /system /translation=concealed -
  disk:[gcc.] gnu_cc
$ assign /system /translation=concealed -
  disk:[gcc.include.] gnu_cc_include
</pre>

<p>with the appropriate disk and directory names.  These commands can be
placed in your system startup file so they will be executed whenever
the machine is rebooted.  You may, if you choose, do this via the
<code>GCC_INSTALL.COM</code> script in the <code>[GCC]</code> directory.

</p><li>Install the <code>GCC</code> command with the command line:

<pre>$ set command /table=sys$common:[syslib]dcltables -
  /output=sys$common:[syslib]dcltables gnu_cc:[000000]gcc
$ install replace sys$common:[syslib]dcltables
</pre>

<li>To install the help file, do the following:

<pre>$ library/help sys$library:helplib.hlb gcc.hlp
</pre>

<p>Now you can invoke the compiler with a command like <code>gcc /verbose
file.c</code>, which is equivalent to the command <code>gcc -v -c file.c</code> in
Unix.
</ol>

<p>If you wish to use GNU C++ you must first install GNU CC, and then
perform the following steps:

<ol type=1 start=1>
</p><li>Define the VMS logical name <code>GNU_GXX_INCLUDE</code> to point to the
directory where the preprocessor will search for the C++ header files. 
This can be done with the command:

<pre>$ assign /system /translation=concealed -
  disk:[gcc.gxx_include.] gnu_gxx_include
</pre>

<p>with the appropriate disk and directory name.  If you are going to be
using a C++ runtime library, this is where its install procedure will install
its header files.

</p><li>Obtain the file <code>gcc-cc1plus.exe</code>, and place this in the same
directory that <code>gcc-cc1.exe</code> is kept.

<p>The GNU C++ compiler can be invoked with a command like <code>gcc /plus
/verbose file.cc</code>, which is equivalent to the command <code>g++ -v -c
file.cc</code> in Unix.
</ol>

<p>We try to put corresponding binaries and sources on the VMS distribution
tape.  But sometimes the binaries will be from an older version than the
sources, because we don't always have time to update them.  (Use the
<code>/version</code> option to determine the version number of the binaries and
compare it with the source file <code>version.c</code> to tell whether this is
so.)  In this case, you should use the binaries you get to recompile the
sources.  If you must recompile, here is how:

<ol type=1 start=1>
</p><li>Execute the command procedure <code>vmsconfig.com</code> to set up the files
<code>tm.h</code>, <code>config.h</code>, <code>aux-output.c</code>, and <code>md.</code>, and
to create files <code>tconfig.h</code> and <code>hconfig.h</code>.  This procedure
also creates several linker option files used by <code>make-cc1.com</code> and
a data file used by <code>make-l2.com</code>.

<pre>$ @vmsconfig.com
</pre>

<li>Setup the logical names and command tables as defined above.  In
addition, define the VMS logical name <code>GNU_BISON</code> to point at the
to the directories where the Bison executable is kept.  This should be
done with the command:

<pre>$ assign /system /translation=concealed -
  disk:[bison.] gnu_bison
</pre>

<p>You may, if you choose, use the <code>INSTALL_BISON.COM</code> script in the
<code>[BISON]</code> directory.

</p><li>Install the <code>BISON</code> command with the command line:

<pre>$ set command /table=sys$common:[syslib]dcltables -
  /output=sys$common:[syslib]dcltables -
  gnu_bison:[000000]bison
$ install replace sys$common:[syslib]dcltables
</pre>

<li>Type <code>@make-gcc</code> to recompile everything (alternatively, submit
the file <code>make-gcc.com</code> to a batch queue).  If you wish to build
the GNU C++ compiler as well as the GNU CC compiler, you must first edit
<code>make-gcc.com</code> and follow the instructions that appear in the
comments.

<li>In order to use GCC, you need a library of functions which GCC compiled code
will call to perform certain tasks, and these functions are defined in the
file <code>libgcc2.c</code>.  To compile this you should use the command procedure
<code>make-l2.com</code>, which will generate the library <code>libgcc2.olb</code>. 
<code>libgcc2.olb</code> should be built using the compiler built from
the same distribution that <code>libgcc2.c</code> came from, and
<code>make-gcc.com</code> will automatically do all of this for you.

<p>To install the library, use the following commands:

<pre>$ library gnu_cc:[000000]gcclib/delete=(new,eprintf)
$ library gnu_cc:[000000]gcclib/delete=L_*
$ library libgcc2/extract=*/output=libgcc2.obj
$ library gnu_cc:[000000]gcclib libgcc2.obj
</pre>

<p>The first command simply removes old modules that will be replaced with
modules from <code>libgcc2</code> under different module names.  The modules
<code>new</code> and <code>eprintf</code> may not actually be present in your
<code>gcclib.olb</code>--if the VMS librarian complains about those modules
not being present, simply ignore the message and continue on with the
next command.  The second command removes the modules that came from the
previous version of the library <code>libgcc2.c</code>.

<p>Whenever you update the compiler on your system, you should also update the
library with the above procedure.

</p><li>You may wish to build GCC in such a way that no files are written to the
directory where the source files reside.  An example would be the when
the source files are on a read-only disk.  In these cases, execute the
following DCL commands (substituting your actual path names):

<pre>$ assign dua0:[gcc.build_dir.]/translation=concealed, -
         dua1:[gcc.source_dir.]/translation=concealed  gcc_build
$ set default gcc_build:[000000]
</pre>

<p>where the directory <code>dua1:[gcc.source_dir]</code> contains the source
code, and the directory <code>dua0:[gcc.build_dir]</code> is meant to contain
all of the generated object files and executables.  Once you have done
this, you can proceed building GCC as described above.  (Keep in mind
that <code>gcc_build</code> is a rooted logical name, and thus the device
names in each element of the search list must be an actual physical
device name rather than another rooted logical name).

</p><li><strong>If you are building GNU CC with a previous version of GNU CC,
you also should check to see that you have the newest version of the
assembler</strong>.  In particular, GNU CC version 2 treats global constant
variables slightly differently from GNU CC version 1, and GAS version
1.38.1 does not have the patches required to work with GCC version 2. 
If you use GAS 1.38.1, then <code>extern const</code> variables will not have
the read-only bit set, and the linker will generate warning messages
about mismatched psect attributes for these variables.  These warning
messages are merely a nuisance, and can safely be ignored.

<p>If you are compiling with a version of GNU CC older than 1.33, specify
<code>/DEFINE=("inline=")</code> as an option in all the compilations.  This
requires editing all the <code>gcc</code> commands in <code>make-cc1.com</code>. 
(The older versions had problems supporting <code>inline</code>.)  Once you
have a working 1.33 or newer GNU CC, you can change this file back.

</p><li>If you want to build GNU CC with the VAX C compiler, you will need to
make minor changes in <code>make-cccp.com</code> and <code>make-cc1.com</code>
to choose alternate definitions of <code>CC</code>, <code>CFLAGS</code>, and
<code>LIBS</code>.  See comments in those files.  However, you must
also have a working version of the GNU assembler (GNU as, aka GAS) as
it is used as the back-end for GNU CC to produce binary object modules
and is not included in the GNU CC sources.  GAS is also needed to
compile <code>libgcc2</code> in order to build <code>gcclib</code> (see above);
<code>make-l2.com</code> expects to be able to find it operational in
<code>gnu_cc:[000000]gnu-as.exe</code>.

<p>To use GNU CC on VMS, you need the VMS driver programs
<code>gcc.exe</code>, <code>gcc.com</code>, and <code>gcc.cld</code>.  They are
distributed with the VMS binaries (<code>gcc-vms</code>) rather than the
GNU CC sources.  GAS is also included in <code>gcc-vms</code>, as is Bison.

<p>Once you have successfully built GNU CC with VAX C, you should use the
resulting compiler to rebuild itself.  Before doing this, be sure to
restore the <code>CC</code>, <code>CFLAGS</code>, and <code>LIBS</code> definitions in
<code>make-cccp.com</code> and <code>make-cc1.com</code>.  The second generation
compiler will be able to take advantage of many optimizations that must
be suppressed when building with other compilers.
</ol>

<p>Under previous versions of GNU CC, the generated code would occasionally
give strange results when linked with the sharable <code>VAXCRTL</code> library. 
Now this should work.

<p>Even with this version, however, GNU CC itself should not be linked with
the sharable <code>VAXCRTL</code>.  The version of <code>qsort</code> in
<code>VAXCRTL</code> has a bug (known to be present in VMS versions V4.6
through V5.5) which causes the compiler to fail.

<p>The executables are generated by <code>make-cc1.com</code> and
<code>make-cccp.com</code> use the object library version of <code>VAXCRTL</code> in
order to make use of the <code>qsort</code> routine in <code>gcclib.olb</code>.  If
you wish to link the compiler executables with the shareable image
version of <code>VAXCRTL</code>, you should edit the file <code>tm.h</code> (created
by <code>vmsconfig.com</code>) to define the macro <code>QSORT_WORKAROUND</code>.

<p><code>QSORT_WORKAROUND</code> is always defined when GNU CC is compiled with
VAX C, to avoid a problem in case <code>gcclib.olb</code> is not yet
available.

<h2><code>collect2</code></h2>

<p>GNU CC uses a utility called <code>collect2</code> on nearly all systems to arrange
to call various initialization functions at start time.

<p>The program <code>collect2</code> works by linking the program once and
looking through the linker output file for symbols with particular names
indicating they are constructor functions.  If it finds any, it
creates a new temporary <code>.c</code> file containing a table of them,
compiles it, and links the program a second time including that file.

<p>The actual calls to the constructors are carried out by a subroutine
called <code>__main</code>, which is called (automatically) at the beginning
of the body of <code>main</code> (provided <code>main</code> was compiled with GNU
CC).  Calling <code>__main</code> is necessary, even when compiling C code, to
allow linking C and C++ object code together.  (If you use
<code>-nostdlib</code>, you get an unresolved reference to <code>__main</code>,
since it's defined in the standard GCC library.  Include <code>-lgcc</code> at
the end of your compiler command line to resolve this reference.)

<p>The program <code>collect2</code> is installed as <code>ld</code> in the directory
where the passes of the compiler are installed.  When <code>collect2</code>
needs to find the <em>real</em> <code>ld</code>, it tries the following file
names:

<ul>
<li><code>real-ld</code> in the directories listed in the compiler's search
directories.

<li><code>real-ld</code> in the directories listed in the environment variable
<code>PATH</code>.

<li>The file specified in the <code>REAL_LD_FILE_NAME</code> configuration macro,
if specified.

<li><code>ld</code> in the compiler's search directories, except that
<code>collect2</code> will not execute itself recursively.

<li><code>ld</code> in <code>PATH</code>. 
</ul>

<p>"The compiler's search directories" means all the directories where
<code>gcc</code> searches for passes of the compiler.  This includes
directories that you specify with <code>-B</code>.

<p>Cross-compilers search a little differently:

<ul>
<li><code>real-ld</code> in the compiler's search directories.

<li><code><var>target</var>-real-ld</code> in <code>PATH</code>.

<li>The file specified in the <code>REAL_LD_FILE_NAME</code> configuration macro,
if specified.

<li><code>ld</code> in the compiler's search directories.

<li><code><var>target</var>-ld</code> in <code>PATH</code>. 
</ul>

<p><code>collect2</code> explicitly avoids running <code>ld</code> using the file name
under which <code>collect2</code> itself was invoked.  In fact, it remembers
up a list of such names--in case one copy of <code>collect2</code> finds
another copy (or version) of <code>collect2</code> installed as <code>ld</code> in a
second place in the search path.

<p><code>collect2</code> searches for the utilities <code>nm</code> and <code>strip</code>
using the same algorithm as above for <code>ld</code>.

<h2>Standard Header File Directories</h2>

<p><code>GCC_INCLUDE_DIR</code> means the same thing for native and cross.  It is
where GNU CC stores its private include files, and also where GNU CC
stores the fixed include files.  A cross compiled GNU CC runs
<code>fixincludes</code> on the header files in <code>$(tooldir)/include</code>. 
(If the cross compilation header files need to be fixed, they must be
installed before GNU CC is built.  If the cross compilation header files
are already suitable for ANSI C and GNU CC, nothing special need be
done).

<p><code>GPLUSPLUS_INCLUDE_DIR</code> means the same thing for native and cross.  It
is where <code>g++</code> looks first for header files.  The C++ library
installs only target independent header files in that directory.

<p><code>LOCAL_INCLUDE_DIR</code> is used only for a native compiler.  It is
normally <code>/usr/local/include</code>.  GNU CC searches this directory so
that users can install header files in <code>/usr/local/include</code>.

<p><code>CROSS_INCLUDE_DIR</code> is used only for a cross compiler.  GNU CC
doesn't install anything there.

<p><code>TOOL_INCLUDE_DIR</code> is used for both native and cross compilers.  It
is the place for other packages to install header files that GNU CC will
use.  For a cross-compiler, this is the equivalent of
<code>/usr/include</code>.  When you build a cross-compiler,

<h1>Extensions to the C Language Family</h1>

<p>GNU C provides several language features not found in ANSI standard C. 
(The <code>-pedantic</code> option directs GNU CC to print a warning message if
any of these features is used.)  To test for the availability of these
features in conditional compilation, check for a predefined macro
<code>__GNUC__</code>, which is always defined under GNU CC.

<p>These extensions are available in C and Objective C.  Most of them are
also available in C++.  See <a href="#C++%20Extensions">Extensions to the C++ Language</a>, for extensions that apply <em>only</em> to C++.

<h2>Statements and Declarations in Expressions</h2>

<p>A compound statement enclosed in parentheses may appear as an expression
in GNU C.  This allows you to use loops, switches, and local variables
within an expression.

<p>Recall that a compound statement is a sequence of statements surrounded
by braces; in this construct, parentheses go around the braces.  For
example:

<pre>({ int y = foo (); int z;
   if (y &gt; 0) z = y;
   else z = - y;
   z; })
</pre>

<p>is a valid (though slightly more complex than necessary) expression
for the absolute value of <code>foo ()</code>.

<p>The last thing in the compound statement should be an expression
followed by a semicolon; the value of this subexpression serves as the
value of the entire construct.  (If you use some other kind of statement
last within the braces, the construct has type <code>void</code>, and thus
effectively no value.)

<p>This feature is especially useful in making macro definitions "safe" (so
that they evaluate each operand exactly once).  For example, the
"maximum" function is commonly defined as a macro in standard C as
follows:

<pre>#define max(a,b) ((a) &gt; (b) ? (a) : (b))
</pre>

<p>But this definition computes either <var>a</var> or <var>b</var> twice, with bad
results if the operand has side effects.  In GNU C, if you know the
type of the operands (here let's assume <code>int</code>), you can define
the macro safely as follows:

<pre>#define maxint(a,b) \
  ({int _a = (a), _b = (b); _a &gt; _b ? _a : _b; })
</pre>

<p>Embedded statements are not allowed in constant expressions, such as
the value of an enumeration constant, the width of a bit field, or
the initial value of a static variable.

<p>If you don't know the type of the operand, you can still do this, but you
must use <code>typeof</code> (see <a href="#Typeof">Typeof</a>) or type naming (see <a href="#Naming%20Types">Naming Types</a>).

Up:<a rel=up href="#C%20Extensions">C Extensions</a>
<br>

<h2>Locally Declared Labels</h2>

<p>Each statement expression is a scope in which <dfn>local labels</dfn> can be
declared.  A local label is simply an identifier; you can jump to it
with an ordinary <code>goto</code> statement, but only from within the
statement expression it belongs to.

<p>A local label declaration looks like this:

<pre>__label__ <var>label</var>;
</pre>

<p>or

<pre>__label__ <var>label1</var>, <var>label2</var>, <small>...</small>;
</pre>

<p>Local label declarations must come at the beginning of the statement
expression, right after the <code>({</code>, before any ordinary
declarations.

<p>The label declaration defines the label <em>name</em>, but does not define
the label itself.  You must do this in the usual way, with
<code><var>label</var>:</code>, within the statements of the statement expression.

<p>The local label feature is useful because statement expressions are
often used in macros.  If the macro contains nested loops, a <code>goto</code>
can be useful for breaking out of them.  However, an ordinary label
whose scope is the whole function cannot be used: if the macro can be
expanded several times in one function, the label will be multiply
defined in that function.  A local label avoids this problem.  For
example:

<pre>#define SEARCH(array, target)                     \
({                                               \
  __label__ found;                                \
  typeof (target) _SEARCH_target = (target);      \
  typeof (*(array)) *_SEARCH_array = (array);     \
  int i, j;                                       \
  int value;                                      \
  for (i = 0; i &lt; max; i++)                       \
    for (j = 0; j &lt; max; j++)                     \
      if (_SEARCH_array[i][j] == _SEARCH_target)  \
        { value = i; goto found; }              \
  value = -1;                                     \
 found:                                           \
  value;                                          \
})
</pre>

<h2>Labels as Values</h2>

<p>You can get the address of a label defined in the current function
(or a containing function) with the unary operator <code>&amp;&amp;</code>.  The
value has type <code>void *</code>.  This value is a constant and can be used
wherever a constant of that type is valid.  For example:

<pre>void *ptr;
<small>...</small>
ptr = &amp;&amp;foo;
</pre>

<p>To use these values, you need to be able to jump to one.  This is done
with the computed goto statement<a rel=footnote href="#fn-1"><sup>1</sup></a>, <code>goto *<var>exp</var>;</code>.  For example,

<pre>goto *ptr;
</pre>

<p>Any expression of type <code>void *</code> is allowed.

<p>One way of using these constants is in initializing a static array that
will serve as a jump table:

<pre>static void *array[] = { &amp;&amp;foo, &amp;&amp;bar, &amp;&amp;hack };
</pre>

<p>Then you can select a label with indexing, like this:

<pre>goto *array[i];
</pre>

<p>Note that this does not check whether the subscript is in bounds--array
indexing in C never does that.

<p>Such an array of label values serves a purpose much like that of the
<code>switch</code> statement.  The <code>switch</code> statement is cleaner, so
use that rather than an array unless the problem does not fit a
<code>switch</code> statement very well.

<p>Another use of label values is in an interpreter for threaded code. 
The labels within the interpreter function can be stored in the
threaded code for super-fast dispatching.

<p>You can use this mechanism to jump to code in a different function.  If
you do that, totally unpredictable things will happen.  The best way to
avoid this is to store the label address only in automatic variables and
never pass it as an argument.

<h2>Nested Functions</h2>

<p>A <dfn>nested function</dfn> is a function defined inside another function. 
(Nested functions are not supported for GNU C++.)  The nested function's
name is local to the block where it is defined.  For example, here we
define a nested function named <code>square</code>, and call it twice:

<pre>foo (double a, double b)
{
  double square (double z) { return z * z; }

  return square (a) + square (b);
}
</pre>

<p>The nested function can access all the variables of the containing
function that are visible at the point of its definition.  This is
called <dfn>lexical scoping</dfn>.  For example, here we show a nested
function which uses an inherited variable named <code>offset</code>:

<pre>bar (int *array, int offset, int size)
{
  int access (int *array, int index)
    { return array[index + offset]; }
  int i;
  <small>...</small>
  for (i = 0; i &lt; size; i++)
    <small>...</small> access (array, i) <small>...</small>
}
</pre>

<p>Nested function definitions are permitted within functions in the places
where variable definitions are allowed; that is, in any block, before
the first statement in the block.

<p>It is possible to call the nested function from outside the scope of its
name by storing its address or passing the address to another function:

<pre>hack (int *array, int size)
{
  void store (int index, int value)
    { array[index] = value; }

  intermediate (store, size);
}
</pre>

<p>Here, the function <code>intermediate</code> receives the address of
<code>store</code> as an argument.  If <code>intermediate</code> calls <code>store</code>,
the arguments given to <code>store</code> are used to store into <code>array</code>. 
But this technique works only so long as the containing function
(<code>hack</code>, in this example) does not exit.

<p>If you try to call the nested function through its address after the
containing function has exited, all hell will break loose.  If you try
to call it after a containing scope level has exited, and if it refers
to some of the variables that are no longer in scope, you may be lucky,
but it's not wise to take the risk.  If, however, the nested function
does not refer to anything that has gone out of scope, you should be
safe.

<p>GNU CC implements taking the address of a nested function using a
technique called <dfn>trampolines</dfn>.   A paper describing them is
available as <code>http://master.debian.org/~karlheg/Usenix88-lexic.pdf</code>.

<p>A nested function can jump to a label inherited from a containing
function, provided the label was explicitly declared in the containing
function (see <a href="#Local%20Labels">Local Labels</a>).  Such a jump returns instantly to the
containing function, exiting the nested function which did the
<code>goto</code> and any intermediate functions as well.  Here is an example:

<pre>bar (int *array, int offset, int size)
{
  __label__ failure;
  int access (int *array, int index)
    {
      if (index &gt; size)
        goto failure;
      return array[index + offset];
    }
  int i;
  <small>...</small>
  for (i = 0; i &lt; size; i++)
    <small>...</small> access (array, i) <small>...</small>
  <small>...</small>
  return 0;

 /* Control comes here from <code>access</code>
    if it detects an error.  */
 failure:
  return -1;
}
</pre>

<p>A nested function always has internal linkage.  Declaring one with
<code>extern</code> is erroneous.  If you need to declare the nested function
before its definition, use <code>auto</code> (which is otherwise meaningless
for function declarations).

<pre>bar (int *array, int offset, int size)
{
  __label__ failure;
  auto int access (int *, int);
  <small>...</small>
  int access (int *array, int index)
    {
      if (index &gt; size)
        goto failure;
      return array[index + offset];
    }
  <small>...</small>
}
</pre>

<h2>Constructing Function Calls</h2>

<p>Using the built-in functions described below, you can record
the arguments a function received, and call another function
with the same arguments, without knowing the number or types
of the arguments.

<p>You can also record the return value of that function call,
and later return that value, without knowing what data type
the function tried to return (as long as your caller expects
that data type).

<dl>
<dt><code>__builtin_apply_args ()</code>
<dd>This built-in function returns a pointer of type <code>void *</code> to data
describing how to perform a call with the same arguments as were passed
to the current function.

<p>The function saves the arg pointer register, structure value address,
and all registers that might be used to pass arguments to a function
into a block of memory allocated on the stack.  Then it returns the
address of that block.

<br><dt><code>__builtin_apply (<var>function</var>, <var>arguments</var>, <var>size</var>)</code>
<dd>This built-in function invokes <var>function</var> (type <code>void (*)()</code>)
with a copy of the parameters described by <var>arguments</var> (type
<code>void *</code>) and <var>size</var> (type <code>int</code>).

<p>The value of <var>arguments</var> should be the value returned by
<code>__builtin_apply_args</code>.  The argument <var>size</var> specifies the size
of the stack argument data, in bytes.

<p>This function returns a pointer of type <code>void *</code> to data describing
how to return whatever value was returned by <var>function</var>.  The data
is saved in a block of memory allocated on the stack.

<p>It is not always simple to compute the proper value for <var>size</var>.  The
value is used by <code>__builtin_apply</code> to compute the amount of data
that should be pushed on the stack and copied from the incoming argument
area.

<br><dt><code>__builtin_return (<var>result</var>)</code>
<dd>This built-in function returns the value described by <var>result</var> from
the containing function.  You should specify, for <var>result</var>, a value
returned by <code>__builtin_apply</code>.

<h2>Naming an Expression's Type</h2>

<p>You can give a name to the type of an expression using a <code>typedef</code>
declaration with an initializer.  Here is how to define <var>name</var> as a
type name for the type of <var>exp</var>:

<pre>typedef <var>name</var> = <var>exp</var>;
</pre>

<p>This is useful in conjunction with the statements-within-expressions
feature.  Here is how the two together can be used to define a safe
"maximum" macro that operates on any arithmetic type:

<pre>#define max(a,b) \
  ({typedef _ta = (a), _tb = (b);  \
    _ta _a = (a); _tb _b = (b);     \
    _a &gt; _b ? _a : _b; })
</pre>

<p>The reason for using names that start with underscores for the local
variables is to avoid conflicts with variable names that occur within the
expressions that are substituted for <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>.  Eventually we
hope to design a new form of declaration syntax that allows you to declare
variables whose scopes start only after their initializers; this will be a
more reliable way to prevent such conflicts.

<br>

<h2>Referring to a Type with <code>typeof</code></h2>

<p>Another way to refer to the type of an expression is with <code>typeof</code>. 
The syntax of using of this keyword looks like <code>sizeof</code>, but the
construct acts semantically like a type name defined with <code>typedef</code>.

<p>There are two ways of writing the argument to <code>typeof</code>: with an
expression or with a type.  Here is an example with an expression:

<pre>typeof (x[0](1))
</pre>

<p>This assumes that <code>x</code> is an array of functions; the type described
is that of the values of the functions.

<p>Here is an example with a typename as the argument:

<pre>typeof (int *)
</pre>

<p>Here the type described is that of pointers to <code>int</code>.

<p>If you are writing a header file that must work when included in ANSI C
programs, write <code>__typeof__</code> instead of <code>typeof</code>. 
See <a href="#Alternate%20Keywords">Alternate Keywords</a>.

<p>A <code>typeof</code>-construct can be used anywhere a typedef name could be
used.  For example, you can use it in a declaration, in a cast, or inside
of <code>sizeof</code> or <code>typeof</code>.

<ul>
<li>This declares <code>y</code> with the type of what <code>x</code> points to.

<pre>typeof (*x) y;
</pre>

<li>This declares <code>y</code> as an array of such values.

<pre>typeof (*x) y[4];
</pre>

<li>This declares <code>y</code> as an array of pointers to characters:

<pre>typeof (typeof (char *)[4]) y;
</pre>

<p>It is equivalent to the following traditional C declaration:

<pre>char *y[4];
</pre>

<p>To see the meaning of the declaration using <code>typeof</code>, and why it
might be a useful way to write, let's rewrite it with these macros:

<pre>#define pointer(T)  typeof(T *)
#define array(T, N) typeof(T [N])
</pre>

<p>Now the declaration can be rewritten this way:

<pre>array (pointer (char), 4) y;
</pre>

<p>Thus, <code>array (pointer (char), 4)</code> is the type of arrays of 4
pointers to <code>char</code>. 
</ul>

<h2>Generalized Lvalues</h2>

<p>Compound expressions, conditional expressions and casts are allowed as
lvalues provided their operands are lvalues.  This means that you can take
their addresses or store values into them.

<p>Standard C++ allows compound expressions and conditional expressions as
lvalues, and permits casts to reference type, so use of this extension
is deprecated for C++ code.

<p>For example, a compound expression can be assigned, provided the last
expression in the sequence is an lvalue.  These two expressions are
equivalent:

<pre>(a, b) += 5
a, (b += 5)
</pre>

<p>Similarly, the address of the compound expression can be taken.  These two
expressions are equivalent:

<pre>&amp;(a, b)
a, &amp;b
</pre>

<p>A conditional expression is a valid lvalue if its type is not void and the
true and false branches are both valid lvalues.  For example, these two
expressions are equivalent:

<pre>(a ? b : c) = 5
(a ? b = 5 : (c = 5))
</pre>

<p>A cast is a valid lvalue if its operand is an lvalue.  A simple
assignment whose left-hand side is a cast works by converting the
right-hand side first to the specified type, then to the type of the
inner left-hand side expression.  After this is stored, the value is
converted back to the specified type to become the value of the
assignment.  Thus, if <code>a</code> has type <code>char *</code>, the following two
expressions are equivalent:

<pre>(int)a = 5
(int)(a = (char *)(int)5)
</pre>

<p>An assignment-with-arithmetic operation such as <code>+=</code> applied to a cast
performs the arithmetic using the type resulting from the cast, and then
continues as in the previous case.  Therefore, these two expressions are
equivalent:

<pre>(int)a += 5
(int)(a = (char *)(int) ((int)a + 5))
</pre>

<p>You cannot take the address of an lvalue cast, because the use of its
address would not work out coherently.  Suppose that <code>&amp;(int)f</code> were
permitted, where <code>f</code> has type <code>float</code>.  Then the following
statement would try to store an integer bit-pattern where a floating
point number belongs:

<pre>*&amp;(int)f = 1;
</pre>

<p>This is quite different from what <code>(int)f = 1</code> would do--that
would convert 1 to floating point and store it.  Rather than cause this
inconsistency, we think it is better to prohibit use of <code>&amp;</code> on a cast.

<p>If you really do want an <code>int *</code> pointer with the address of
<code>f</code>, you can simply write <code>(int *)&amp;f</code>.

<h2>Conditionals with Omitted Operands</h2>

<p>The middle operand in a conditional expression may be omitted.  Then
if the first operand is nonzero, its value is the value of the conditional
expression.

<p>Therefore, the expression

<pre>x ? : y
</pre>

<p>has the value of <code>x</code> if that is nonzero; otherwise, the value of
<code>y</code>.

<p>This example is perfectly equivalent to

<pre>x ? x : y
</pre>

<p>In this simple case, the ability to omit the middle operand is not
especially useful.  When it becomes useful is when the first operand does,
or may (if it is a macro argument), contain a side effect.  Then repeating
the operand in the middle would perform the side effect twice.  Omitting
the middle operand uses the value already computed without the undesirable
effects of recomputing it.

<h2>Double-Word Integers</h2>

<p>GNU C supports data types for integers that are twice as long as
<code>int</code>.  Simply write <code>long long int</code> for a signed integer, or
<code>unsigned long long int</code> for an unsigned integer.  To make an
integer constant of type <code>long long int</code>, add the suffix <code>LL</code>
to the integer.  To make an integer constant of type <code>unsigned long
long int</code>, add the suffix <code>ULL</code> to the integer.

<p>You can use these types in arithmetic like any other integer types. 
Addition, subtraction, and bitwise boolean operations on these types
are open-coded on all types of machines.  Multiplication is open-coded
if the machine supports fullword-to-doubleword a widening multiply
instruction.  Division and shifts are open-coded only on machines that
provide special support.  The operations that are not open-coded use
special library routines that come with GNU CC.

<p>There may be pitfalls when you use <code>long long</code> types for function
arguments, unless you declare function prototypes.  If a function
expects type <code>int</code> for its argument, and you pass a value of type
<code>long long int</code>, confusion will result because the caller and the
subroutine will disagree about the number of bytes for the argument. 
Likewise, if the function expects <code>long long int</code> and you pass
<code>int</code>.  The best way to avoid such problems is to use prototypes.

<h2>Complex Numbers</h2>

<p>GNU C supports complex data types.  You can declare both complex integer
types and complex floating types, using the keyword <code>__complex__</code>.

<p>For example, <code>__complex__ double x;</code> declares <code>x</code> as a
variable whose real part and imaginary part are both of type
<code>double</code>.  <code>__complex__ short int y;</code> declares <code>y</code> to
have real and imaginary parts of type <code>short int</code>; this is not
likely to be useful, but it shows that the set of complex types is
complete.

<p>To write a constant with a complex data type, use the suffix <code>i</code> or
<code>j</code> (either one; they are equivalent).  For example, <code>2.5fi</code>
has type <code>__complex__ float</code> and <code>3i</code> has type
<code>__complex__ int</code>.  Such a constant always has a pure imaginary
value, but you can form any complex value you like by adding one to a
real constant.

<p>To extract the real part of a complex-valued expression <var>exp</var>, write
<code>__real__ <var>exp</var></code>.  Likewise, use <code>__imag__</code> to
extract the imaginary part.

<p>The operator <code>~</code> performs complex conjugation when used on a value
with a complex type.

<p>GNU CC can allocate complex automatic variables in a noncontiguous
fashion; it's even possible for the real part to be in a register while
the imaginary part is on the stack (or vice-versa).  None of the
supported debugging info formats has a way to represent noncontiguous
allocation like this, so GNU CC describes a noncontiguous complex
variable as if it were two separate variables of noncomplex type. 
If the variable's actual name is <code>foo</code>, the two fictitious
variables are named <code>foo$real</code> and <code>foo$imag</code>.  You can
examine and set these two fictitious variables with your debugger.

<p>A future version of GDB will know how to recognize such pairs and treat
them as a single variable with a complex type.

<h2>Hex Floats</h2>

<p>GNU CC recognizes floating-point numbers written not only in the usual
decimal notation, such as <code>1.55e1</code>, but also numbers such as
<code>0x1.fp3</code> written in hexadecimal format.  In that format the
<code>0x</code> hex introducer and the <code>p</code> or <code>P</code> exponent field are
mandatory.  The exponent is a decimal number that indicates the power of
2 by which the significand part will be multiplied.  Thus <code>0x1.f</code> is
1 15/16, <code>p3</code> multiplies it by 8, and the value of <code>0x1.fp3</code>
is the same as <code>1.55e1</code>.

<p>Unlike for floating-point numbers in the decimal notation the exponent
is always required in the hexadecimal notation.  Otherwise the compiler
would not be able to resolve the ambiguity of, e.g., <code>0x1.f</code>.  This
could mean <code>1.0f</code> or <code>1.9375</code> since <code>f</code> is also the
extension for floating-point constants of type <code>float</code>.

<h2>Arrays of Length Zero</h2>

<p>Zero-length arrays are allowed in GNU C.  They are very useful as the last
element of a structure which is really a header for a variable-length
object:

<pre>struct line {
  int length;
  char contents[0];
};

{
  struct line *thisline = (struct line *)
    malloc (sizeof (struct line) + this_length);
  thisline-&gt;length = this_length;
}
</pre>

<p>In standard C, you would have to give <code>contents</code> a length of 1, which
means either you waste space or complicate the argument to <code>malloc</code>.

<br>

<h2>Arrays of Variable Length</h2>

<p>Variable-length automatic arrays are allowed in GNU C.  These arrays are
declared like any other automatic arrays, but with a length that is not
a constant expression.  The storage is allocated at the point of
declaration and deallocated when the brace-level is exited.  For
example:

<pre>FILE *
concat_fopen (char *s1, char *s2, char *mode)
{
  char str[strlen (s1) + strlen (s2) + 1];
  strcpy (str, s1);
  strcat (str, s2);
  return fopen (str, mode);
}
</pre>

<p>Jumping or breaking out of the scope of the array name deallocates the
storage.  Jumping into the scope is not allowed; you get an error
message for it.

<p>You can use the function <code>alloca</code> to get an effect much like
variable-length arrays.  The function <code>alloca</code> is available in
many other C implementations (but not in all).  On the other hand,
variable-length arrays are more elegant.

<p>There are other differences between these two methods.  Space allocated
with <code>alloca</code> exists until the containing <em>function</em> returns. 
The space for a variable-length array is deallocated as soon as the array
name's scope ends.  (If you use both variable-length arrays and
<code>alloca</code> in the same function, deallocation of a variable-length array
will also deallocate anything more recently allocated with <code>alloca</code>.)

<p>You can also use variable-length arrays as arguments to functions:

<pre>struct entry
tester (int len, char data[len][len])
{
  <small>...</small>
}
</pre>

<p>The length of an array is computed once when the storage is allocated
and is remembered for the scope of the array in case you access it with
<code>sizeof</code>.

<p>If you want to pass the array first and the length afterward, you can
use a forward declaration in the parameter list--another GNU extension.

<pre>struct entry
tester (int len; char data[len][len], int len)
{
  <small>...</small>
}
</pre>

<p>The <code>int len</code> before the semicolon is a <dfn>parameter forward
declaration</dfn>, and it serves the purpose of making the name <code>len</code>
known when the declaration of <code>data</code> is parsed.

<p>You can write any number of such parameter forward declarations in the
parameter list.  They can be separated by commas or semicolons, but the
last one must end with a semicolon, which is followed by the "real"
parameter declarations.  Each forward declaration must match a "real"
declaration in parameter name and data type.

<h2>Macros with Variable Numbers of Arguments</h2>

<p>In GNU C, a macro can accept a variable number of arguments, much as a
function can.  The syntax for defining the macro looks much like that
used for a function.  Here is an example:

<pre>#define eprintf(format, args...)  \
 fprintf (stderr, format , ## args)
</pre>

<p>Here <code>args</code> is a <dfn>rest argument</dfn>: it takes in zero or more
arguments, as many as the call contains.  All of them plus the commas
between them form the value of <code>args</code>, which is substituted into
the macro body where <code>args</code> is used.  Thus, we have this expansion:

<pre>eprintf ("%s:%d: ", input_file_name, line_number)
==&gt;
fprintf (stderr, "%s:%d: " , input_file_name, line_number)
</pre>

<p>Note that the comma after the string constant comes from the definition
of <code>eprintf</code>, whereas the last comma comes from the value of
<code>args</code>.

<p>The reason for using <code>##</code> is to handle the case when <code>args</code>
matches no arguments at all.  In this case, <code>args</code> has an empty
value.  In this case, the second comma in the definition becomes an
embarrassment: if it got through to the expansion of the macro, we would
get something like this:

<pre>fprintf (stderr, "success!\n" , )
</pre>

<p>which is invalid C syntax.  <code>##</code> gets rid of the comma, so we get
the following instead:

<pre>fprintf (stderr, "success!\n")
</pre>

<p>This is a special feature of the GNU C preprocessor: <code>##</code> before a
rest argument that is empty discards the preceding sequence of
non-whitespace characters from the macro definition.  (If another macro
argument precedes, none of it is discarded.)

<p>It might be better to discard the last preprocessor token instead of the
last preceding sequence of non-whitespace characters; in fact, we may
someday change this feature to do so.  We advise you to write the macro
definition so that the preceding sequence of non-whitespace characters
is just a single token, so that the meaning will not change if we change
the definition of this feature.

<h2>Non-Lvalue Arrays May Have Subscripts</h2>

<p>Subscripting is allowed on arrays that are not lvalues, even though the
unary <code>&amp;</code> operator is not.  For example, this is valid in GNU C though
not valid in other C dialects:

<pre>struct foo {int a[4];};

struct foo f();

bar (int index)
{
  return f().a[index];
}

<h2>Arithmetic on <code>void</code>- and Function-Pointers</h2>

<p>In GNU C, addition and subtraction operations are supported on pointers to
<code>void</code> and on pointers to functions.  This is done by treating the
size of a <code>void</code> or of a function as 1.

<p>A consequence of this is that <code>sizeof</code> is also allowed on <code>void</code>
and on function types, and returns 1.

<p>The option <code>-Wpointer-arith</code> requests a warning if these extensions
are used.

<h2>Non-Constant Initializers</h2>

<p>As in standard C++, the elements of an aggregate initializer for an
automatic variable are not required to be constant expressions in GNU C. 
Here is an example of an initializer with run-time varying elements:

<pre>foo (float f, float g)
{
  float beat_freqs[2] = { f-g, f+g };
  <small>...</small>
}
</pre>

<br>

<h2>Constructor Expressions</h2>

<p>GNU C supports constructor expressions.  A constructor looks like
a cast containing an initializer.  Its value is an object of the
type specified in the cast, containing the elements specified in
the initializer.

<p>Usually, the specified type is a structure.  Assume that
<code>struct foo</code> and <code>structure</code> are declared as shown:

<pre>struct foo {int a; char b[2];} structure;
</pre>

<p>Here is an example of constructing a <code>struct foo</code> with a constructor:

<pre>structure = ((struct foo) {x + y, 'a', 0});
</pre>

<p>This is equivalent to writing the following:

<pre>{
  struct foo temp = {x + y, 'a', 0};
  structure = temp;
}
</pre>

<p>You can also construct an array.  If all the elements of the constructor
are (made up of) simple constant expressions, suitable for use in
initializers, then the constructor is an lvalue and can be coerced to a
pointer to its first element, as shown here:

<pre>char **foo = (char *[]) { "x", "y", "z" };
</pre>

<p>Array constructors whose elements are not simple constants are
not very useful, because the constructor is not an lvalue.  There
are only two valid ways to use it: to subscript it, or initialize
an array variable with it.  The former is probably slower than a
<code>switch</code> statement, while the latter does the same thing an
ordinary C initializer would do.  Here is an example of
subscripting an array constructor:

<pre>output = ((int[]) { 2, x, 28 }) [input];
</pre>

<p>Constructor expressions for scalar types and union types are is
also allowed, but then the constructor expression is equivalent
to a cast.

<h2>Labeled Elements in Initializers</h2>

<p>Standard C requires the elements of an initializer to appear in a fixed
order, the same as the order of the elements in the array or structure
being initialized.

<p>In GNU C you can give the elements in any order, specifying the array
indices or structure field names they apply to.  This extension is not
implemented in GNU C++.

<p>To specify an array index, write <code>[<var>index</var>]</code> or
<code>[<var>index</var>] =</code> before the element value.  For example,

<pre>int a[6] = { [4] 29, [2] = 15 };
</pre>

<p>is equivalent to

<pre>int a[6] = { 0, 0, 15, 0, 29, 0 };
</pre>

<p>The index values must be constant expressions, even if the array being
initialized is automatic.

<p>To initialize a range of elements to the same value, write
<code>[<var>first</var> ... <var>last</var>] = <var>value</var></code>.  For example,

<pre>int widths[] = { [0 ... 9] = 1, [10 ... 99] = 2, [100] = 3 };
</pre>

<p>Note that the length of the array is the highest value specified
plus one.

<p>In a structure initializer, specify the name of a field to initialize
with <code><var>fieldname</var>:</code> before the element value.  For example,
given the following structure,

<pre>struct point { int x, y; };
</pre>

<p>the following initialization

<pre>struct point p = { y: yvalue, x: xvalue };
</pre>

<p>is equivalent to

<pre>struct point p = { xvalue, yvalue };
</pre>

<p>Another syntax which has the same meaning is <code>.<var>fieldname</var> =</code>.,
as shown here:

<pre>struct point p = { .y = yvalue, .x = xvalue };
</pre>

<p>You can also use an element label (with either the colon syntax or the
period-equal syntax) when initializing a union, to specify which element
of the union should be used.  For example,

<pre>union foo { int i; double d; };

union foo f = { d: 4 };
</pre>

<p>will convert 4 to a <code>double</code> to store it in the union using
the second element.  By contrast, casting 4 to type <code>union foo</code>
would store it into the union as the integer <code>i</code>, since it is
an integer.  (See <a href="#Cast%20to%20Union">Cast to Union</a>.)

<p>You can combine this technique of naming elements with ordinary C
initialization of successive elements.  Each initializer element that
does not have a label applies to the next consecutive element of the
array or structure.  For example,

<pre>int a[6] = { [1] = v1, v2, [4] = v4 };
</pre>

<p>is equivalent to

<pre>int a[6] = { 0, v1, v2, 0, v4, 0 };
</pre>

<p>Labeling the elements of an array initializer is especially useful
when the indices are characters or belong to an <code>enum</code> type. 
For example:

<pre>int whitespace[256]
  = { [' '] = 1, ['\t'] = 1, ['\h'] = 1,
      ['\f'] = 1, ['\n'] = 1, ['\r'] = 1 };
</pre>

<br>

<h2>Case Ranges</h2>

<p>You can specify a range of consecutive values in a single <code>case</code> label,
like this:

<pre>case <var>low</var> ... <var>high</var>:
</pre>

<p>This has the same effect as the proper number of individual <code>case</code>
labels, one for each integer value from <var>low</var> to <var>high</var>, inclusive.

<p>This feature is especially useful for ranges of ASCII character codes:

<pre>case 'A' ... 'Z':
</pre>

<p><strong>Be careful:</strong> Write spaces around the <code>...</code>, for otherwise
it may be parsed wrong when you use it with integer values.  For example,
write this:

<pre>case 1 ... 5:
</pre>

<p>rather than this:

<pre>case 1...5:
</pre>

<br>

<h2>Cast to a Union Type</h2>

<p>A cast to union type is similar to other casts, except that the type
specified is a union type.  You can specify the type either with
<code>union <var>tag</var></code> or with a typedef name.  A cast to union is actually
a constructor though, not a cast, and hence does not yield an lvalue like
normal casts.  (See <a href="#Constructors">Constructors</a>.)

<p>The types that may be cast to the union type are those of the members
of the union.  Thus, given the following union and variables:

<pre>union foo { int i; double d; };
int x;
double y;
</pre>

<p>both <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> can be cast to type <code>union</code> foo.

<p>Using the cast as the right-hand side of an assignment to a variable of
union type is equivalent to storing in a member of the union:

<pre>union foo u;
<small>...</small>
u = (union foo) x  ==  u.i = x
u = (union foo) y  ==  u.d = y
</pre>

<p>You can also use the union cast as a function argument:

<pre>void hack (union foo);
<small>...</small>
hack ((union foo) x);
</pre>

<h2>Declaring Attributes of Functions</h2>

<p>In GNU C, you declare certain things about functions called in your program
which help the compiler optimize function calls and check your code more
carefully.

<p>The keyword <code>__attribute__</code> allows you to specify special
attributes when making a declaration.  This keyword is followed by an
attribute specification inside double parentheses.  Nine attributes,
<code>noreturn</code>, <code>const</code>, <code>format</code>,
<code>no_instrument_function</code>, <code>section</code>,
<code>constructor</code>, <code>destructor</code>, <code>unused</code> and <code>weak</code> are
currently defined for functions.  Other attributes, including
<code>section</code> are supported for variables declarations (see <a href="#Variable%20Attributes">Variable Attributes</a>) and for types (see <a href="#Type%20Attributes">Type Attributes</a>).

<p>You may also specify attributes with <code>__</code> preceding and following
each keyword.  This allows you to use them in header files without
being concerned about a possible macro of the same name.  For example,
you may use <code>__noreturn__</code> instead of <code>noreturn</code>.

<dl>
<dt><code>noreturn</code>
<dd>A few standard library functions, such as <code>abort</code> and <code>exit</code>,
cannot return.  GNU CC knows this automatically.  Some programs define
their own functions that never return.  You can declare them
<code>noreturn</code> to tell the compiler this fact.  For example,

<pre>void fatal () __attribute__ ((noreturn));

void
fatal (<small>...</small>)
{
  <small>...</small> /* Print error message. */ <small>...</small>
  exit (1);
}
</pre>

<p>The <code>noreturn</code> keyword tells the compiler to assume that
<code>fatal</code> cannot return.  It can then optimize without regard to what
would happen if <code>fatal</code> ever did return.  This makes slightly
better code.  More importantly, it helps avoid spurious warnings of
uninitialized variables.

<p>Do not assume that registers saved by the calling function are
restored before calling the <code>noreturn</code> function.

<p>It does not make sense for a <code>noreturn</code> function to have a return
type other than <code>void</code>.

<p>The attribute <code>noreturn</code> is not implemented in GNU C versions
earlier than 2.5.  An alternative way to declare that a function does
not return, which works in the current version and in some older
versions, is as follows:

<pre>typedef void voidfn ();

volatile voidfn fatal;
</pre>

<br><dt><code>const</code>
<dd>Many functions do not examine any values except their arguments, and
have no effects except the return value.  Such a function can be subject
to common subexpression elimination and loop optimization just as an
arithmetic operator would be.  These functions should be declared
with the attribute <code>const</code>.  For example,

<pre>int square (int) __attribute__ ((const));
</pre>

<p>says that the hypothetical function <code>square</code> is safe to call
fewer times than the program says.

<p>The attribute <code>const</code> is not implemented in GNU C versions earlier
than 2.5.  An alternative way to declare that a function has no side
effects, which works in the current version and in some older versions,
is as follows:

<pre>typedef int intfn ();

extern const intfn square;
</pre>

<p>This approach does not work in GNU C++ from 2.6.0 on, since the language
specifies that the <code>const</code> must be attached to the return value.

<p>Note that a function that has pointer arguments and examines the data
pointed to must <em>not</em> be declared <code>const</code>.  Likewise, a
function that calls a non-<code>const</code> function usually must not be
<code>const</code>.  It does not make sense for a <code>const</code> function to
return <code>void</code>.

<br><dt><code>format (<var>archetype</var>, <var>string-index</var>, <var>first-to-check</var>)</code>
<dd>The <code>format</code> attribute specifies that a function takes <code>printf</code>,
<code>scanf</code>, or <code>strftime</code> style arguments which should be type-checked
against a format string.  For example, the declaration:

<pre>extern int
my_printf (void *my_object, const char *my_format, ...)
      __attribute__ ((format (printf, 2, 3)));
</pre>

<p>causes the compiler to check the arguments in calls to <code>my_printf</code>
for consistency with the <code>printf</code> style format string argument
<code>my_format</code>.

<p>The parameter <var>archetype</var> determines how the format string is
interpreted, and should be either <code>printf</code>, <code>scanf</code>, or
<code>strftime</code>.  The
parameter <var>string-index</var> specifies which argument is the format
string argument (starting from 1), while <var>first-to-check</var> is the
number of the first argument to check against the format string.  For
functions where the arguments are not available to be checked (such as
<code>vprintf</code>), specify the third parameter as zero.  In this case the
compiler only checks the format string for consistency.

<p>In the example above, the format string (<code>my_format</code>) is the second
argument of the function <code>my_print</code>, and the arguments to check
start with the third argument, so the correct parameters for the format
attribute are 2 and 3.

<p>The <code>format</code> attribute allows you to identify your own functions
which take format strings as arguments, so that GNU CC can check the
calls to these functions for errors.  The compiler always checks formats
for the ANSI library functions <code>printf</code>, <code>fprintf</code>,
<code>sprintf</code>, <code>scanf</code>, <code>fscanf</code>, <code>sscanf</code>, <code>strftime</code>,
<code>vprintf</code>, <code>vfprintf</code> and <code>vsprintf</code> whenever such
warnings are requested (using <code>-Wformat</code>), so there is no need to
modify the header file <code>stdio.h</code>.

<br><dt><code>format_arg (<var>string-index</var>)</code>
<dd>The <code>format_arg</code> attribute specifies that a function takes
<code>printf</code> or <code>scanf</code> style arguments, modifies it (for example,
to translate it into another language), and passes it to a <code>printf</code>
or <code>scanf</code> style function.  For example, the declaration:

<pre>extern char *
my_dgettext (char *my_domain, const char *my_format)
      __attribute__ ((format_arg (2)));
</pre>

<p>causes the compiler to check the arguments in calls to
<code>my_dgettext</code> whose result is passed to a <code>printf</code>,
<code>scanf</code>, or <code>strftime</code> type function for consistency with the
<code>printf</code> style format string argument <code>my_format</code>.

<p>The parameter <var>string-index</var> specifies which argument is the format
string argument (starting from 1).

<p>The <code>format-arg</code> attribute allows you to identify your own
functions which modify format strings, so that GNU CC can check the
calls to <code>printf</code>, <code>scanf</code>, or <code>strftime</code> function whose
operands are a call to one of your own function.  The compiler always
treats <code>gettext</code>, <code>dgettext</code>, and <code>dcgettext</code> in this
manner.

<br><dt><code>no_instrument_function</code>
<dd>If <code>-finstrument-functions</code> is given, profiling function calls will
be generated at entry and exit of most user-compiled functions. 
Functions with this attribute will not be so instrumented.

<br><dt><code>section ("section-name")</code>
<dd>Normally, the compiler places the code it generates in the <code>text</code> section. 
Sometimes, however, you need additional sections, or you need certain
particular functions to appear in special sections.  The <code>section</code>
attribute specifies that a function lives in a particular section. 
For example, the declaration:

<pre>extern void foobar (void) __attribute__ ((section ("bar")));
</pre>

<p>puts the function <code>foobar</code> in the <code>bar</code> section.

<p>Some file formats do not support arbitrary sections so the <code>section</code>
attribute is not available on all platforms. 
If you need to map the entire contents of a module to a particular
section, consider using the facilities of the linker instead.

<br><dt><code>constructor</code>
<dt><code>destructor</code>
<dd>The <code>constructor</code> attribute causes the function to be called
automatically before execution enters <code>main ()</code>.  Similarly, the
<code>destructor</code> attribute causes the function to be called
automatically after <code>main ()</code> has completed or <code>exit ()</code> has
been called.  Functions with these attributes are useful for
initializing data that will be used implicitly during the execution of
the program.

<p>These attributes are not currently implemented for Objective C.

<br><dt><code>unused</code>
<dd>This attribute, attached to a function, means that the function is meant
to be possibly unused.  GNU CC will not produce a warning for this
function.  GNU C++ does not currently support this attribute as
definitions without parameters are valid in C++.

<br><dt><code>weak</code>
<dd>The <code>weak</code> attribute causes the declaration to be emitted as a weak
symbol rather than a global.  This is primarily useful in defining
library functions which can be overridden in user code, though it can
also be used with non-function declarations.  Weak symbols are supported
for ELF targets, and also for a.out targets when using the GNU assembler
and linker.

<br><dt><code>alias ("target")</code>
<dd>The <code>alias</code> attribute causes the declaration to be emitted as an
alias for another symbol, which must be specified.  For instance,

<pre>void __f () { /* do something */; }
void f () __attribute__ ((weak, alias ("__f")));
</pre>

<p>declares <code>f</code> to be a weak alias for <code>__f</code>.  In C++, the
mangled name for the target must be used.

<p>Not all target machines support this attribute.

<br><dt><code>no_check_memory_usage</code>
<dd>If <code>-fcheck-memory-usage</code> is given, calls to support routines will
be generated before most memory accesses, to permit support code to
record usage and detect uses of uninitialized or unallocated storage. 
Since the compiler cannot handle them properly, <code>asm</code> statements
are not allowed.  Declaring a function with this attribute disables the
memory checking code for that function, permitting the use of <code>asm</code>
statements without requiring separate compilation with different
options, and allowing you to write support routines of your own if you
wish, without getting infinite recursion if they get compiled with this
option.

<br><dt><code>regparm (<var>number</var>)</code>
<dd>On the Intel 386, the <code>regparm</code> attribute causes the compiler to
pass up to <var>number</var> integer arguments in registers <var>EAX</var>,
<var>EDX</var>, and <var>ECX</var> instead of on the stack.  Functions that take a
variable number of arguments will continue to be passed all of their
arguments on the stack.

<br><dt><code>stdcall</code>
<dd>On the Intel 386, the <code>stdcall</code> attribute causes the compiler to
assume that the called function will pop off the stack space used to
pass arguments, unless it takes a variable number of arguments.

<p>The PowerPC compiler for Windows NT currently ignores the <code>stdcall</code>
attribute.

<br><dt><code>cdecl</code>
<dd>On the Intel 386, the <code>cdecl</code> attribute causes the compiler to
assume that the calling function will pop off the stack space used to
pass arguments.  This is
useful to override the effects of the <code>-mrtd</code> switch.

<p>The PowerPC compiler for Windows NT currently ignores the <code>cdecl</code>
attribute.

<br><dt><code>longcall</code>
<dd>On the RS/6000 and PowerPC, the <code>longcall</code> attribute causes the
compiler to always call the function via a pointer, so that functions
which reside further than 64 megabytes (67,108,864 bytes) from the
current location can be called.

<br><dt><code>dllimport</code>
<dd>On the PowerPC running Windows NT, the <code>dllimport</code> attribute causes
the compiler to call the function via a global pointer to the function
pointer that is set up by the Windows NT dll library.  The pointer name
is formed by combining <code>__imp_</code> and the function name.

<br><dt><code>dllexport</code>
<dd>On the PowerPC running Windows NT, the <code>dllexport</code> attribute causes
the compiler to provide a global pointer to the function pointer, so
that it can be called with the <code>dllimport</code> attribute.  The pointer
name is formed by combining <code>__imp_</code> and the function name.

<br><dt><code>exception (<var>except-func</var> [, <var>except-arg</var>])</code>
<dd>On the PowerPC running Windows NT, the <code>exception</code> attribute causes
the compiler to modify the structured exception table entry it emits for
the declared function.  The string or identifier <var>except-func</var> is
placed in the third entry of the structured exception table.  It
represents a function, which is called by the exception handling
mechanism if an exception occurs.  If it was specified, the string or
identifier <var>except-arg</var> is placed in the fourth entry of the
structured exception table.

<br><dt><code>function_vector</code>
<dd>Use this option on the H8/300 and H8/300H to indicate that the specified
function should be called through the function vector.  Calling a
function through the function vector will reduce code size, however;
the function vector has a limited size (maximum 128 entries on the H8/300
and 64 entries on the H8/300H) and shares space with the interrupt vector.

<p>You must use GAS and GLD from GNU binutils version 2.7 or later for
this option to work correctly.

<br><dt><code>interrupt_handler</code>
<dd>Use this option on the H8/300 and H8/300H to indicate that the specified
function is an interrupt handler.  The compiler will generate function
entry and exit sequences suitable for use in an interrupt handler when this
attribute is present.

<br><dt><code>eightbit_data</code>
<dd>Use this option on the H8/300 and H8/300H to indicate that the specified
variable should be placed into the eight bit data section. 
The compiler will generate more efficient code for certain operations
on data in the eight bit data area.  Note the eight bit data area is limited to
256 bytes of data.

<p>You must use GAS and GLD from GNU binutils version 2.7 or later for
this option to work correctly.

<br><dt><code>tiny_data</code>
<dd>Use this option on the H8/300H to indicate that the specified
variable should be placed into the tiny data section. 
The compiler will generate more efficient code for loads and stores
on data in the tiny data section.  Note the tiny data area is limited to
slightly under 32kbytes of data.

<br><dt><code>interrupt</code>
<dd>Use this option on the M32R/D to indicate that the specified
function is an interrupt handler.  The compiler will generate function
entry and exit sequences suitable for use in an interrupt handler when this
attribute is present.

<br><dt><code>model (<var>model-name</var>)</code>
<dd>Use this attribute on the M32R/D to set the addressability of an object,
and the code generated for a function. 
The identifier <var>model-name</var> is one of <code>small</code>, <code>medium</code>,
or <code>large</code>, representing each of the code models.

<p>Small model objects live in the lower 16MB of memory (so that their
addresses can be loaded with the <code>ld24</code> instruction), and are
callable with the <code>bl</code> instruction.

<p>Medium model objects may live anywhere in the 32 bit address space (the
compiler will generate <code>seth/add3</code> instructions to load their addresses),
and are callable with the <code>bl</code> instruction.

<p>Large model objects may live anywhere in the 32 bit address space (the
compiler will generate <code>seth/add3</code> instructions to load their addresses),
and may not be reachable with the <code>bl</code> instruction (the compiler will
generate the much slower <code>seth/add3/jl</code> instruction sequence).

</dl>

<p>You can specify multiple attributes in a declaration by separating them
by commas within the double parentheses or by immediately following an
attribute declaration with another attribute declaration.

<p>Some people object to the <code>__attribute__</code> feature, suggesting that ANSI C's
<code>#pragma</code> should be used instead.  There are two reasons for not
doing this.

<ol type=1 start=1>
</p><li>It is impossible to generate <code>#pragma</code> commands from a macro.

<li>There is no telling what the same <code>#pragma</code> might mean in another
compiler.
</ol>

<p>These two reasons apply to almost any application that might be proposed
for <code>#pragma</code>.  It is basically a mistake to use <code>#pragma</code> for
<em>anything</em>.

<h2>Prototypes and Old-Style Function Definitions</h2>

<p>GNU C extends ANSI C to allow a function prototype to override a later
old-style non-prototype definition.  Consider the following example:

<pre>/* Use prototypes unless the compiler is old-fashioned.  */
#ifdef __STDC__
#define P(x) x
#else
#define P(x) ()
#endif

/* Prototype function declaration.  */
int isroot P((uid_t));

/* Old-style function definition.  */
int
isroot (x)   /* ??? lossage here ??? */
     uid_t x;
{
  return x == 0;
}
</pre>

<p>Suppose the type <code>uid_t</code> happens to be <code>short</code>.  ANSI C does
not allow this example, because subword arguments in old-style
non-prototype definitions are promoted.  Therefore in this example the
function definition's argument is really an <code>int</code>, which does not
match the prototype argument type of <code>short</code>.

<p>This restriction of ANSI C makes it hard to write code that is portable
to traditional C compilers, because the programmer does not know
whether the <code>uid_t</code> type is <code>short</code>, <code>int</code>, or
<code>long</code>.  Therefore, in cases like these GNU C allows a prototype
to override a later old-style definition.  More precisely, in GNU C, a
function prototype argument type overrides the argument type specified
by a later old-style definition if the former type is the same as the
latter type before promotion.  Thus in GNU C the above example is
equivalent to the following:

<pre>int isroot (uid_t);

int
isroot (uid_t x)
{
  return x == 0;
}
</pre>

<p>GNU C++ does not support old-style function definitions, so this
extension is irrelevant.

<h2>C++ Style Comments</h2>

<p>In GNU C, you may use C++ style comments, which start with <code>//</code> and
continue until the end of the line.  Many other C implementations allow
such comments, and they are likely to be in a future C standard. 
However, C++ style comments are not recognized if you specify
<code>-ansi</code> or <code>-traditional</code>, since they are incompatible
with traditional constructs like <code>dividend//*comment*/divisor</code>.

<h2>Dollar Signs in Identifier Names</h2>

<p>In GNU C, you may normally use dollar signs in identifier names. 
This is because many traditional C implementations allow such identifiers. 
However, dollar signs in identifiers are not supported on a few target
machines, typically because the target assembler does not allow them.

<h2>Inquiring on Alignment of Types or Variables</h2>

<p>The keyword <code>__alignof__</code> allows you to inquire about how an object
is aligned, or the minimum alignment usually required by a type.  Its
syntax is just like <code>sizeof</code>.

<p>For example, if the target machine requires a <code>double</code> value to be
aligned on an 8-byte boundary, then <code>__alignof__ (double)</code> is 8. 
This is true on many RISC machines.  On more traditional machine
designs, <code>__alignof__ (double)</code> is 4 or even 2.

<p>Some machines never actually require alignment; they allow reference to any
data type even at an odd addresses.  For these machines, <code>__alignof__</code>
reports the <em>recommended</em> alignment of a type.

<p>When the operand of <code>__alignof__</code> is an lvalue rather than a type, the
value is the largest alignment that the lvalue is known to have.  It may
have this alignment as a result of its data type, or because it is part of
a structure and inherits alignment from that structure.  For example, after
this declaration:

<pre>struct foo { int x; char y; } foo1;
</pre>

<p>the value of <code>__alignof__ (foo1.y)</code> is probably 2 or 4, the same as
<code>__alignof__ (int)</code>, even though the data type of <code>foo1.y</code>
does not itself demand any alignment.

<p>A related feature which lets you specify the alignment of an object is
<code>__attribute__ ((aligned (<var>alignment</var>)))</code>; see the following
section.

<h2>Specifying Attributes of Variables</h2>

<p>The keyword <code>__attribute__</code> allows you to specify special
attributes of variables or structure fields.  This keyword is followed
by an attribute specification inside double parentheses.  Eight
attributes are currently defined for variables: <code>aligned</code>,
<code>mode</code>, <code>nocommon</code>, <code>packed</code>, <code>section</code>,
<code>transparent_union</code>, <code>unused</code>, and <code>weak</code>.  Other
attributes are available for functions (see <a href="#Function%20Attributes">Function Attributes</a>) and
for types (see <a href="#Type%20Attributes">Type Attributes</a>).

<p>You may also specify attributes with <code>__</code> preceding and following
each keyword.  This allows you to use them in header files without
being concerned about a possible macro of the same name.  For example,
you may use <code>__aligned__</code> instead of <code>aligned</code>.

<dl>
<dt><code>aligned (<var>alignment</var>)</code>
<dd>This attribute specifies a minimum alignment for the variable or
structure field, measured in bytes.  For example, the declaration:

<pre>int x __attribute__ ((aligned (16))) = 0;
</pre>

<p>causes the compiler to allocate the global variable <code>x</code> on a
16-byte boundary.  On a 68040, this could be used in conjunction with
an <code>asm</code> expression to access the <code>move16</code> instruction which
requires 16-byte aligned operands.

<p>You can also specify the alignment of structure fields.  For example, to
create a double-word aligned <code>int</code> pair, you could write:

<pre>struct foo { int x[2] __attribute__ ((aligned (8))); };
</pre>

<p>This is an alternative to creating a union with a <code>double</code> member
that forces the union to be double-word aligned.

<p>It is not possible to specify the alignment of functions; the alignment
of functions is determined by the machine's requirements and cannot be
changed.  You cannot specify alignment for a typedef name because such a
name is just an alias, not a distinct type.

<p>As in the preceding examples, you can explicitly specify the alignment
(in bytes) that you wish the compiler to use for a given variable or
structure field.  Alternatively, you can leave out the alignment factor
and just ask the compiler to align a variable or field to the maximum
useful alignment for the target machine you are compiling for.  For
example, you could write:

<pre>short array[3] __attribute__ ((aligned));
</pre>

<p>Whenever you leave out the alignment factor in an <code>aligned</code> attribute
specification, the compiler automatically sets the alignment for the declared
variable or field to the largest alignment which is ever used for any data
type on the target machine you are compiling for.  Doing this can often make
copy operations more efficient, because the compiler can use whatever
instructions copy the biggest chunks of memory when performing copies to
or from the variables or fields that you have aligned this way.

<p>The <code>aligned</code> attribute can only increase the alignment; but you
can decrease it by specifying <code>packed</code> as well.  See below.

<p>Note that the effectiveness of <code>aligned</code> attributes may be limited
by inherent limitations in your linker.  On many systems, the linker is
only able to arrange for variables to be aligned up to a certain maximum
alignment.  (For some linkers, the maximum supported alignment may
be very very small.)  If your linker is only able to align variables
up to a maximum of 8 byte alignment, then specifying <code>aligned(16)</code>
in an <code>__attribute__</code> will still only provide you with 8 byte
alignment.  See your linker documentation for further information.

<br><dt><code>mode (<var>mode</var>)</code>
<dd>This attribute specifies the data type for the declaration--whichever
type corresponds to the mode <var>mode</var>.  This in effect lets you
request an integer or floating point type according to its width.

<p>You may also specify a mode of <code>byte</code> or <code>__byte__</code> to
indicate the mode corresponding to a one-byte integer, <code>word</code> or
<code>__word__</code> for the mode of a one-word integer, and <code>pointer</code>
or <code>__pointer__</code> for the mode used to represent pointers.

<br><dt><code>nocommon</code>
<dd>This attribute specifies requests GNU CC not to place a variable
"common" but instead to allocate space for it directly.  If you
specify the <code>-fno-common</code> flag, GNU CC will do this for all
variables.

<p>Specifying the <code>nocommon</code> attribute for a variable provides an
initialization of zeros.  A variable may only be initialized in one
source file.

<br><dt><code>packed</code>
<dd>The <code>packed</code> attribute specifies that a variable or structure field
should have the smallest possible alignment--one byte for a variable,
and one bit for a field, unless you specify a larger value with the
<code>aligned</code> attribute.

<p>Here is a structure in which the field <code>x</code> is packed, so that it
immediately follows <code>a</code>:

<pre>struct foo
{
  char a;
  int x[2] __attribute__ ((packed));
};
</pre>

<br><dt><code>section ("section-name")</code>
<dd>Normally, the compiler places the objects it generates in sections like
<code>data</code> and <code>bss</code>.  Sometimes, however, you need additional sections,
or you need certain particular variables to appear in special sections,
for example to map to special hardware.  The <code>section</code>
attribute specifies that a variable (or function) lives in a particular
section.  For example, this small program uses several specific section names:

<pre>struct duart a __attribute__ ((section ("DUART_A"))) = { 0 };
struct duart b __attribute__ ((section ("DUART_B"))) = { 0 };
char stack[10000] __attribute__ ((section ("STACK"))) = { 0 };
int init_data __attribute__ ((section ("INITDATA"))) = 0;

main()
{
  /* Initialize stack pointer */
  init_sp (stack + sizeof (stack));

  /* Initialize initialized data */
  memcpy (&amp;init_data, &amp;data, &amp;edata - &amp;data);

  /* Turn on the serial ports */
  init_duart (&amp;a);
  init_duart (&amp;b);
}
</pre>

<p>Use the <code>section</code> attribute with an <em>initialized</em> definition
of a <em>global</em> variable, as shown in the example.  GNU CC issues
a warning and otherwise ignores the <code>section</code> attribute in
uninitialized variable declarations.

<p>You may only use the <code>section</code> attribute with a fully initialized
global definition because of the way linkers work.  The linker requires
each object be defined once, with the exception that uninitialized
variables tentatively go in the <code>common</code> (or <code>bss</code>) section
and can be multiply "defined".  You can force a variable to be
initialized with the <code>-fno-common</code> flag or the <code>nocommon</code>
attribute.

<p>Some file formats do not support arbitrary sections so the <code>section</code>
attribute is not available on all platforms. 
If you need to map the entire contents of a module to a particular
section, consider using the facilities of the linker instead.

<br><dt><code>shared</code>
<dd>On Windows NT, in addition to nputting variable definitions in a named
section, the section can also be shared among all running copies of an
executable or DLL. For example, this small program defines shared data
by putting it in a named section "shared" and marking the section
shareable:

<pre>int foo __attribute__((section ("shared"), shared)) = 0;

int
main()
{
  /* Read and write foo. All running copies see the same value. */
  return 0;
}
</pre>

<p>You may only use the <code>shared</code> attribute along with <code>section</code>
attribute with a fully initialized global definition because of the way
linkers work.  See <code>section</code> attribute for more information.

<p>The <code>shared</code> attribute is only available on Windows NT.

<br><dt><code>transparent_union</code>
<dd>This attribute, attached to a function parameter which is a union, means
that the corresponding argument may have the type of any union member,
but the argument is passed as if its type were that of the first union
member.  For more details see See <a href="#Type%20Attributes">Type Attributes</a>.  You can also use
this attribute on a <code>typedef</code> for a union data type; then it
applies to all function parameters with that type.

<br><dt><code>unused</code>
<dd>This attribute, attached to a variable, means that the variable is meant
to be possibly unused.  GNU CC will not produce a warning for this
variable.

<br><dt><code>weak</code>
<dd>The <code>weak</code> attribute is described in See <a href="#Function%20Attributes">Function Attributes</a>.

<br><dt><code>model (<var>model-name</var>)</code>
<dd>Use this attribute on the M32R/D to set the addressability of an object. 
The identifier <var>model-name</var> is one of <code>small</code>, <code>medium</code>,
or <code>large</code>, representing each of the code models.

<p>Small model objects live in the lower 16MB of memory (so that their
addresses can be loaded with the <code>ld24</code> instruction).

<p>Medium and large model objects may live anywhere in the 32 bit address space
(the compiler will generate <code>seth/add3</code> instructions to load their
addresses).

</dl>

<p>To specify multiple attributes, separate them by commas within the
double parentheses: for example, <code>__attribute__ ((aligned (16),
packed))</code>.

<h2>Specifying Attributes of Types</h2>

<p>The keyword <code>__attribute__</code> allows you to specify special
attributes of <code>struct</code> and <code>union</code> types when you define such
types.  This keyword is followed by an attribute specification inside
double parentheses.  Three attributes are currently defined for types:
<code>aligned</code>, <code>packed</code>, and <code>transparent_union</code>.  Other
attributes are defined for functions (see <a href="#Function%20Attributes">Function Attributes</a>) and
for variables (see <a href="#Variable%20Attributes">Variable Attributes</a>).

<p>You may also specify any one of these attributes with <code>__</code>
preceding and following its keyword.  This allows you to use these
attributes in header files without being concerned about a possible
macro of the same name.  For example, you may use <code>__aligned__</code>
instead of <code>aligned</code>.

<p>You may specify the <code>aligned</code> and <code>transparent_union</code>
attributes either in a <code>typedef</code> declaration or just past the
closing curly brace of a complete enum, struct or union type
<em>definition</em> and the <code>packed</code> attribute only past the closing
brace of a definition.

<p>You may also specify attributes between the enum, struct or union
tag and the name of the type rather than after the closing brace.

<dl>
<dt><code>aligned (<var>alignment</var>)</code>
<dd>This attribute specifies a minimum alignment (in bytes) for variables
of the specified type.  For example, the declarations:

<pre>struct S { short f[3]; } __attribute__ ((aligned (8)));
typedef int more_aligned_int __attribute__ ((aligned (8)));
</pre>

<p>force the compiler to insure (as far as it can) that each variable whose
type is <code>struct S</code> or <code>more_aligned_int</code> will be allocated and
aligned <em>at least</em> on a 8-byte boundary.  On a Sparc, having all
variables of type <code>struct S</code> aligned to 8-byte boundaries allows
the compiler to use the <code>ldd</code> and <code>std</code> (doubleword load and
store) instructions when copying one variable of type <code>struct S</code> to
another, thus improving run-time efficiency.

<p>Note that the alignment of any given <code>struct</code> or <code>union</code> type
is required by the ANSI C standard to be at least a perfect multiple of
the lowest common multiple of the alignments of all of the members of
the <code>struct</code> or <code>union</code> in question.  This means that you <em>can</em>
effectively adjust the alignment of a <code>struct</code> or <code>union</code>
type by attaching an <code>aligned</code> attribute to any one of the members
of such a type, but the notation illustrated in the example above is a
more obvious, intuitive, and readable way to request the compiler to
adjust the alignment of an entire <code>struct</code> or <code>union</code> type.

<p>As in the preceding example, you can explicitly specify the alignment
(in bytes) that you wish the compiler to use for a given <code>struct</code>
or <code>union</code> type.  Alternatively, you can leave out the alignment factor
and just ask the compiler to align a type to the maximum
useful alignment for the target machine you are compiling for.  For
example, you could write:

<pre>struct S { short f[3]; } __attribute__ ((aligned));
</pre>

<p>Whenever you leave out the alignment factor in an <code>aligned</code>
attribute specification, the compiler automatically sets the alignment
for the type to the largest alignment which is ever used for any data
type on the target machine you are compiling for.  Doing this can often
make copy operations more efficient, because the compiler can use
whatever instructions copy the biggest chunks of memory when performing
copies to or from the variables which have types that you have aligned
this way.

<p>In the example above, if the size of each <code>short</code> is 2 bytes, then
the size of the entire <code>struct S</code> type is 6 bytes.  The smallest
power of two which is greater than or equal to that is 8, so the
compiler sets the alignment for the entire <code>struct S</code> type to 8
bytes.

<p>Note that although you can ask the compiler to select a time-efficient
alignment for a given type and then declare only individual stand-alone
objects of that type, the compiler's ability to select a time-efficient
alignment is primarily useful only when you plan to create arrays of
variables having the relevant (efficiently aligned) type.  If you
declare or use arrays of variables of an efficiently-aligned type, then
it is likely that your program will also be doing pointer arithmetic (or
subscripting, which amounts to the same thing) on pointers to the
relevant type, and the code that the compiler generates for these
pointer arithmetic operations will often be more efficient for
efficiently-aligned types than for other types.

<p>The <code>aligned</code> attribute can only increase the alignment; but you
can decrease it by specifying <code>packed</code> as well.  See below.

<p>Note that the effectiveness of <code>aligned</code> attributes may be limited
by inherent limitations in your linker.  On many systems, the linker is
only able to arrange for variables to be aligned up to a certain maximum
alignment.  (For some linkers, the maximum supported alignment may
be very very small.)  If your linker is only able to align variables
up to a maximum of 8 byte alignment, then specifying <code>aligned(16)</code>
in an <code>__attribute__</code> will still only provide you with 8 byte
alignment.  See your linker documentation for further information.

<br><dt><code>packed</code>
<dd>This attribute, attached to an <code>enum</code>, <code>struct</code>, or
<code>union</code> type definition, specified that the minimum required memory
be used to represent the type.

<p>Specifying this attribute for <code>struct</code> and <code>union</code> types is
equivalent to specifying the <code>packed</code> attribute on each of the
structure or union members.  Specifying the <code>-fshort-enums</code>
flag on the line is equivalent to specifying the <code>packed</code>
attribute on all <code>enum</code> definitions.

<p>You may only specify this attribute after a closing curly brace on an
<code>enum</code> definition, not in a <code>typedef</code> declaration, unless that
declaration also contains the definition of the <code>enum</code>.

<br><dt><code>transparent_union</code>
<dd>This attribute, attached to a <code>union</code> type definition, indicates
that any function parameter having that union type causes calls to that
function to be treated in a special way.

<p>First, the argument corresponding to a transparent union type can be of
any type in the union; no cast is required.  Also, if the union contains
a pointer type, the corresponding argument can be a null pointer
constant or a void pointer expression; and if the union contains a void
pointer type, the corresponding argument can be any pointer expression. 
If the union member type is a pointer, qualifiers like <code>const</code> on
the referenced type must be respected, just as with normal pointer
conversions.

<p>Second, the argument is passed to the function using the calling
conventions of first member of the transparent union, not the calling
conventions of the union itself.  All members of the union must have the
same machine representation; this is necessary for this argument passing
to work properly.

<p>Transparent unions are designed for library functions that have multiple
interfaces for compatibility reasons.  For example, suppose the
<code>wait</code> function must accept either a value of type <code>int *</code> to
comply with Posix, or a value of type <code>union wait *</code> to comply with
the 4.1BSD interface.  If <code>wait</code>'s parameter were <code>void *</code>,
<code>wait</code> would accept both kinds of arguments, but it would also
accept any other pointer type and this would make argument type checking
less useful.  Instead, <code>&lt;sys/wait.h&gt;</code> might define the interface
as follows:

<pre>typedef union
  {
    int *__ip;
    union wait *__up;
  } wait_status_ptr_t __attribute__ ((__transparent_union__));

pid_t wait (wait_status_ptr_t);
</pre>

<p>This interface allows either <code>int *</code> or <code>union wait *</code>
arguments to be passed, using the <code>int *</code> calling convention. 
The program can call <code>wait</code> with arguments of either type:

<pre>int w1 () { int w; return wait (&amp;w); }
int w2 () { union wait w; return wait (&amp;w); }
</pre>

<p>With this interface, <code>wait</code>'s implementation might look like this:

<pre>pid_t wait (wait_status_ptr_t p)
{
  return waitpid (-1, p.__ip, 0);
}
</pre>

<br><dt><code>unused</code>
<dd>When attached to a type (including a <code>union</code> or a <code>struct</code>),
this attribute means that variables of that type are meant to appear
possibly unused.  GNU CC will not produce a warning for any variables of
that type, even if the variable appears to do nothing.  This is often
the case with lock or thread classes, which are usually defined and then
not referenced, but contain constructors and destructors that have
nontrivial bookkeeping functions.

</dl>

<p>To specify multiple attributes, separate them by commas within the
double parentheses: for example, <code>__attribute__ ((aligned (16),
packed))</code>.

<h2>An Inline Function is As Fast As a Macro</h2>

<p>By declaring a function <code>inline</code>, you can direct GNU CC to
integrate that function's code into the code for its callers.  This
makes execution faster by eliminating the function-call overhead; in
addition, if any of the actual argument values are constant, their known
values may permit simplifications at compile time so that not all of the
inline function's code needs to be included.  The effect on code size is
less predictable; object code may be larger or smaller with function
inlining, depending on the particular case.  Inlining of functions is an
optimization and it really "works" only in optimizing compilation.  If
you don't use <code>-O</code>, no function is really inline.

<p>To declare a function inline, use the <code>inline</code> keyword in its
declaration, like this:

<pre>inline int
inc (int *a)
{
  (*a)++;
}
</pre>

<p>(If you are writing a header file to be included in ANSI C programs, write
<code>__inline__</code> instead of <code>inline</code>.  See <a href="#Alternate%20Keywords">Alternate Keywords</a>.) 
You can also make all "simple enough" functions inline with the option
<code>-finline-functions</code>.

<p>Note that certain usages in a function definition can make it unsuitable
for inline substitution.  Among these usages are: use of varargs, use of
alloca, use of variable sized data types (see <a href="#Variable%20Length">Variable Length</a>),
use of computed goto (see <a href="#Labels%20as%20Values">Labels as Values</a>), use of nonlocal goto,
and nested functions (see <a href="#Nested%20Functions">Nested Functions</a>).  Using <code>-Winline</code>
will warn when a function marked <code>inline</code> could not be substituted,
and will give the reason for the failure.

<p>Note that in C and Objective C, unlike C++, the <code>inline</code> keyword
does not affect the linkage of the function.

<p>GNU CC automatically inlines member functions defined within the class
body of C++ programs even if they are not explicitly declared
<code>inline</code>.  (You can override this with <code>-fno-default-inline</code>;
see <a href="#C++%20Dialect%20Options">Options Controlling C++ Dialect</a>.)

<p>When a function is both inline and <code>static</code>, if all calls to the
function are integrated into the caller, and the function's address is
never used, then the function's own assembler code is never referenced. 
In this case, GNU CC does not actually output assembler code for the
function, unless you specify the option <code>-fkeep-inline-functions</code>. 
Some calls cannot be integrated for various reasons (in particular,
calls that precede the function's definition cannot be integrated, and
neither can recursive calls within the definition).  If there is a
nonintegrated call, then the function is compiled to assembler code as
usual.  The function must also be compiled as usual if the program
refers to its address, because that can't be inlined.

<p>When an inline function is not <code>static</code>, then the compiler must assume
that there may be calls from other source files; since a global symbol can
be defined only once in any program, the function must not be defined in
the other source files, so the calls therein cannot be integrated. 
Therefore, a non-<code>static</code> inline function is always compiled on its
own in the usual fashion.

<p>If you specify both <code>inline</code> and <code>extern</code> in the function
definition, then the definition is used only for inlining.  In no case
is the function compiled on its own, not even if you refer to its
address explicitly.  Such an address becomes an external reference, as
if you had only declared the function, and had not defined it.

<p>This combination of <code>inline</code> and <code>extern</code> has almost the
effect of a macro.  The way to use it is to put a function definition in
a header file with these keywords, and put another copy of the
definition (lacking <code>inline</code> and <code>extern</code>) in a library file. 
The definition in the header file will cause most calls to the function
to be inlined.  If any uses of the function remain, they will refer to
the single copy in the library.

<p>GNU C does not inline any functions when not optimizing.  It is not
clear whether it is better to inline or not, in this case, but we found
that a correct implementation when not optimizing was difficult.  So we
did the easy thing, and turned it off.

<h2>Assembler Instructions with C Expression Operands</h2>

<p>In an assembler instruction using <code>asm</code>, you can specify the
operands of the instruction using C expressions.  This means you need not
guess which registers or memory locations will contain the data you want
to use.

<p>You must specify an assembler instruction template much like what
appears in a machine description, plus an operand constraint string for
each operand.

<p>For example, here is how to use the 68881's <code>fsinx</code> instruction:

<pre>asm ("fsinx %1,%0" : "=f" (result) : "f" (angle));
</pre>

<p>Here <code>angle</code> is the C expression for the input operand while
<code>result</code> is that of the output operand.  Each has <code>"f"</code> as its
operand constraint, saying that a floating point register is required. 
The <code>=</code> in <code>=f</code> indicates that the operand is an output; all
output operands' constraints must use <code>=</code>.  The constraints use the
same language used in the machine description (see <a href="#Constraints">Constraints</a>).

<p>Each operand is described by an operand-constraint string followed by
the C expression in parentheses.  A colon separates the assembler
template from the first output operand and another separates the last
output operand from the first input, if any.  Commas separate the
operands within each group.  The total number of operands is limited to
ten or to the maximum number of operands in any instruction pattern in
the machine description, whichever is greater.

<p>If there are no output operands but there are input operands, you must
place two consecutive colons surrounding the place where the output
operands would go.

<p>Output operand expressions must be lvalues; the compiler can check this. 
The input operands need not be lvalues.  The compiler cannot check
whether the operands have data types that are reasonable for the
instruction being executed.  It does not parse the assembler instruction
template and does not know what it means or even whether it is valid
assembler input.  The extended <code>asm</code> feature is most often used for
machine instructions the compiler itself does not know exist.  If
the output expression cannot be directly addressed (for example, it is a
bit field), your constraint must allow a register.  In that case, GNU CC
will use the register as the output of the <code>asm</code>, and then store
that register into the output.

<p>The ordinary output operands must be write-only; GNU CC will assume that
the values in these operands before the instruction are dead and need
not be generated.  Extended asm supports input-output or read-write
operands.  Use the constraint character <code>+</code> to indicate such an
operand and list it with the output operands.

<p>When the constraints for the read-write operand (or the operand in which
only some of the bits are to be changed) allows a register, you may, as
an alternative, logically split its function into two separate operands,
one input operand and one write-only output operand.  The connection
between them is expressed by constraints which say they need to be in
the same location when the instruction executes.  You can use the same C
expression for both operands, or different expressions.  For example,
here we write the (fictitious) <code>combine</code> instruction with
<code>bar</code> as its read-only source operand and <code>foo</code> as its
read-write destination:

<pre>asm ("combine %2,%0" : "=r" (foo) : "0" (foo), "g" (bar));
</pre>

<p>The constraint <code>"0"</code> for operand 1 says that it must occupy the
same location as operand 0.  A digit in constraint is allowed only in an
input operand and it must refer to an output operand.

<p>Only a digit in the constraint can guarantee that one operand will be in
the same place as another.  The mere fact that <code>foo</code> is the value
of both operands is not enough to guarantee that they will be in the
same place in the generated assembler code.  The following would not
work reliably:

<pre>asm ("combine %2,%0" : "=r" (foo) : "r" (foo), "g" (bar));
</pre>

<p>Various optimizations or reloading could cause operands 0 and 1 to be in
different registers; GNU CC knows no reason not to do so.  For example, the
compiler might find a copy of the value of <code>foo</code> in one register and
use it for operand 1, but generate the output operand 0 in a different
register (copying it afterward to <code>foo</code>'s own address).  Of course,
since the register for operand 1 is not even mentioned in the assembler
code, the result will not work, but GNU CC can't tell that.

<p>Some instructions clobber specific hard registers.  To describe this,
write a third colon after the input operands, followed by the names of
the clobbered hard registers (given as strings).  Here is a realistic
example for the VAX:

<pre>asm volatile ("movc3 %0,%1,%2"
              : /* no outputs */
              : "g" (from), "g" (to), "g" (count)
              : "r0", "r1", "r2", "r3", "r4", "r5");
</pre>

<p>It is an error for a clobber description to overlap an input or output
operand (for example, an operand describing a register class with one
member, mentioned in the clobber list).  Most notably, it is invalid to
describe that an input operand is modified, but unused as output.  It has
to be specified as an input and output operand anyway.  Note that if there
are only unused output operands, you will then also need to specify
<code>volatile</code> for the <code>asm</code> construct, as described below.

<p>If you refer to a particular hardware register from the assembler code,
you will probably have to list the register after the third colon to
tell the compiler the register's value is modified.  In some assemblers,
the register names begin with <code>%</code>; to produce one <code>%</code> in the
assembler code, you must write <code>%%</code> in the input.

<p>If your assembler instruction can alter the condition code register, add
<code>cc</code> to the list of clobbered registers.  GNU CC on some machines
represents the condition codes as a specific hardware register;
<code>cc</code> serves to name this register.  On other machines, the
condition code is handled differently, and specifying <code>cc</code> has no
effect.  But it is valid no matter what the machine.

<p>If your assembler instruction modifies memory in an unpredictable
fashion, add <code>memory</code> to the list of clobbered registers.  This
will cause GNU CC to not keep memory values cached in registers across
the assembler instruction.

<p>You can put multiple assembler instructions together in a single
<code>asm</code> template, separated either with newlines (written as
<code>\n</code>) or with semicolons if the assembler allows such semicolons. 
The GNU assembler allows semicolons and most Unix assemblers seem to do
so.  The input operands are guaranteed not to use any of the clobbered
registers, and neither will the output operands' addresses, so you can
read and write the clobbered registers as many times as you like.  Here
is an example of multiple instructions in a template; it assumes the
subroutine <code>_foo</code> accepts arguments in registers 9 and 10:

<pre>asm ("movl %0,r9;movl %1,r10;call _foo"
     : /* no outputs */
     : "g" (from), "g" (to)
     : "r9", "r10");
</pre>

<p>Unless an output operand has the <code>&amp;</code> constraint modifier, GNU CC
may allocate it in the same register as an unrelated input operand, on
the assumption the inputs are consumed before the outputs are produced. 
This assumption may be false if the assembler code actually consists of
more than one instruction.  In such a case, use <code>&amp;</code> for each output
operand that may not overlap an input.  See <a href="#Modifiers">Modifiers</a>.

<p>If you want to test the condition code produced by an assembler
instruction, you must include a branch and a label in the <code>asm</code>
construct, as follows:

<pre>asm ("clr %0;frob %1;beq 0f;mov #1,%0;0:"
     : "g" (result)
     : "g" (input));
</pre>

<p>This assumes your assembler supports local labels, as the GNU assembler
and most Unix assemblers do.

<p>Speaking of labels, jumps from one <code>asm</code> to another are not
supported.  The compiler's optimizers do not know about these jumps, and
therefore they cannot take account of them when deciding how to
optimize.

<p>Usually the most convenient way to use these <code>asm</code> instructions is to
encapsulate them in macros that look like functions.  For example,

<pre>#define sin(x)       \
({ double __value, __arg = (x);   \
   asm ("fsinx %1,%0": "=f" (__value): "f" (__arg));  \
   __value; })
</pre>

<p>Here the variable <code>__arg</code> is used to make sure that the instruction
operates on a proper <code>double</code> value, and to accept only those
arguments <code>x</code> which can convert automatically to a <code>double</code>.

<p>Another way to make sure the instruction operates on the correct data
type is to use a cast in the <code>asm</code>.  This is different from using a
variable <code>__arg</code> in that it converts more different types.  For
example, if the desired type were <code>int</code>, casting the argument to
<code>int</code> would accept a pointer with no complaint, while assigning the
argument to an <code>int</code> variable named <code>__arg</code> would warn about
using a pointer unless the caller explicitly casts it.

<p>If an <code>asm</code> has output operands, GNU CC assumes for optimization
purposes the instruction has no side effects except to change the output
operands.  This does not mean instructions with a side effect cannot be
used, but you must be careful, because the compiler may eliminate them
if the output operands aren't used, or move them out of loops, or
replace two with one if they constitute a common subexpression.  Also,
if your instruction does have a side effect on a variable that otherwise
appears not to change, the old value of the variable may be reused later
if it happens to be found in a register.

<p>You can prevent an <code>asm</code> instruction from being deleted, moved
significantly, or combined, by writing the keyword <code>volatile</code> after
the <code>asm</code>.  For example:

<pre>#define get_and_set_priority(new)  \
({ int __old; \
   asm volatile ("get_and_set_priority %0, %1": "=g" (__old) : "g" (new)); \
   __old; })
</pre>

<p>If you write an <code>asm</code> instruction with no outputs, GNU CC will know
the instruction has side-effects and will not delete the instruction or
move it outside of loops.  If the side-effects of your instruction are
not purely external, but will affect variables in your program in ways
other than reading the inputs and clobbering the specified registers or
memory, you should write the <code>volatile</code> keyword to prevent future
versions of GNU CC from moving the instruction around within a core
region.

<p>An <code>asm</code> instruction without any operands or clobbers (and "old
style" <code>asm</code>) will not be deleted or moved significantly,
regardless, unless it is unreachable, the same wasy as if you had
written a <code>volatile</code> keyword.

<p>Note that even a volatile <code>asm</code> instruction can be moved in ways
that appear insignificant to the compiler, such as across jump
instructions.  You can't expect a sequence of volatile <code>asm</code>
instructions to remain perfectly consecutive.  If you want consecutive
output, use a single <code>asm</code>.

<p>It is a natural idea to look for a way to give access to the condition
code left by the assembler instruction.  However, when we attempted to
implement this, we found no way to make it work reliably.  The problem
is that output operands might need reloading, which would result in
additional following "store" instructions.  On most machines, these
instructions would alter the condition code before there was time to
test it.  This problem doesn't arise for ordinary "test" and
"compare" instructions because they don't have any output operands.

<p>If you are writing a header file that should be includable in ANSI C
programs, write <code>__asm__</code> instead of <code>asm</code>.  See <a href="#Alternate%20Keywords">Alternate Keywords</a>.

<h3>i386 floating point asm operands</h3>

<p>There are several rules on the usage of stack-like regs in
asm_operands insns.  These rules apply only to the operands that are
stack-like regs:

<ol type=1 start=1>
</p><li>Given a set of input regs that die in an asm_operands, it is
necessary to know which are implicitly popped by the asm, and
which must be explicitly popped by gcc.

<p>An input reg that is implicitly popped by the asm must be
explicitly clobbered, unless it is constrained to match an
output operand.

</p><li>For any input reg that is implicitly popped by an asm, it is
necessary to know how to adjust the stack to compensate for the pop. 
If any non-popped input is closer to the top of the reg-stack than
the implicitly popped reg, it would not be possible to know what the
stack looked like -- it's not clear how the rest of the stack "slides
up".

<p>All implicitly popped input regs must be closer to the top of
the reg-stack than any input that is not implicitly popped.

<p>It is possible that if an input dies in an insn, reload might
use the input reg for an output reload.  Consider this example:

<pre>asm ("foo" : "=t" (a) : "f" (b));
</pre>

<p>This asm says that input B is not popped by the asm, and that
the asm pushes a result onto the reg-stack, ie, the stack is one
deeper after the asm than it was before.  But, it is possible that
reload will think that it can use the same reg for both the input and
the output, if input B dies in this insn.

<p>If any input operand uses the <code>f</code> constraint, all output reg
constraints must use the <code>&amp;</code> earlyclobber.

<p>The asm above would be written as

<pre>asm ("foo" : "=&amp;t" (a) : "f" (b));
</pre>

</p><li>Some operands need to be in particular places on the stack.  All
output operands fall in this category -- there is no other way to
know which regs the outputs appear in unless the user indicates
this in the constraints.

<p>Output operands must specifically indicate which reg an output
appears in after an asm.  <code>=f</code> is not allowed: the operand
constraints must select a class with a single reg.

</p><li>Output operands may not be "inserted" between existing stack regs. 
Since no 387 opcode uses a read/write operand, all output operands
are dead before the asm_operands, and are pushed by the asm_operands. 
It makes no sense to push anywhere but the top of the reg-stack.

<p>Output operands must start at the top of the reg-stack: output
operands may not "skip" a reg.

</p><li>Some asm statements may need extra stack space for internal
calculations.  This can be guaranteed by clobbering stack registers
unrelated to the inputs and outputs.

</ol>

<p>Here are a couple of reasonable asms to want to write.  This asm
takes one input, which is internally popped, and produces two outputs.

<pre>asm ("fsincos" : "=t" (cos), "=u" (sin) : "0" (inp));
</pre>

<p>This asm takes two inputs, which are popped by the <code>fyl2xp1</code> opcode,
and replaces them with one output.  The user must code the <code>st(1)</code>
clobber for reg-stack.c to know that <code>fyl2xp1</code> pops both inputs.

<pre>asm ("fyl2xp1" : "=t" (result) : "0" (x), "u" (y) : "st(1)");
</pre>

<h2>Controlling Names Used in Assembler Code</h2>

<p>You can specify the name to be used in the assembler code for a C
function or variable by writing the <code>asm</code> (or <code>__asm__</code>)
keyword after the declarator as follows:

<pre>int foo asm ("myfoo") = 2;
</pre>

<p>This specifies that the name to be used for the variable <code>foo</code> in
the assembler code should be <code>myfoo</code> rather than the usual
<code>_foo</code>.

<p>On systems where an underscore is normally prepended to the name of a C
function or variable, this feature allows you to define names for the
linker that do not start with an underscore.

<p>You cannot use <code>asm</code> in this way in a function <em>definition</em>; but
you can get the same effect by writing a declaration for the function
before its definition and putting <code>asm</code> there, like this:

<pre>extern func () asm ("FUNC");

func (x, y)
     int x, y;
<small>...</small>
</pre>

<p>It is up to you to make sure that the assembler names you choose do not
conflict with any other assembler symbols.  Also, you must not use a
register name; that would produce completely invalid assembler code.  GNU
CC does not as yet have the ability to store static variables in registers. 
Perhaps that will be added.

<h2>Variables in Specified Registers</h2>

<p>GNU C allows you to put a few global variables into specified hardware
registers.  You can also specify the register in which an ordinary
register variable should be allocated.

<ul>
<li>Global register variables reserve registers throughout the program. 
This may be useful in programs such as programming language
interpreters which have a couple of global variables that are accessed
very often.

<li>Local register variables in specific registers do not reserve the
registers.  The compiler's data flow analysis is capable of determining
where the specified registers contain live values, and where they are
available for other uses.  Stores into local register variables may be deleted
when they appear to be dead according to dataflow analysis.  References
to local register variables may be deleted or moved or simplified.

<p>These local variables are sometimes convenient for use with the extended
<code>asm</code> feature (see <a href="#Extended%20Asm">Extended Asm</a>), if you want to write one
output of the assembler instruction directly into a particular register. 
(This will work provided the register you specify fits the constraints
specified for that operand in the <code>asm</code>.)

<h3>Defining Global Register Variables</h3>

<p>You can define a global register variable in GNU C like this:

<pre>register int *foo asm ("a5");
</pre>

<p>Here <code>a5</code> is the name of the register which should be used.  Choose a
register which is normally saved and restored by function calls on your
machine, so that library routines will not clobber it.

<p>Naturally the register name is cpu-dependent, so you would need to
conditionalize your program according to cpu type.  The register
<code>a5</code> would be a good choice on a 68000 for a variable of pointer
type.  On machines with register windows, be sure to choose a "global"
register that is not affected magically by the function call mechanism.

<p>In addition, operating systems on one type of cpu may differ in how they
name the registers; then you would need additional conditionals.  For
example, some 68000 operating systems call this register <code>%a5</code>.

<p>Eventually there may be a way of asking the compiler to choose a register
automatically, but first we need to figure out how it should choose and
how to enable you to guide the choice.  No solution is evident.

<p>Defining a global register variable in a certain register reserves that
register entirely for this use, at least within the current compilation. 
The register will not be allocated for any other purpose in the functions
in the current compilation.  The register will not be saved and restored by
these functions.  Stores into this register are never deleted even if they
would appear to be dead, but references may be deleted or moved or
simplified.

<p>It is not safe to access the global register variables from signal
handlers, or from more than one thread of control, because the system
library routines may temporarily use the register for other things (unless
you recompile them specially for the task at hand).

<p>It is not safe for one function that uses a global register variable to
call another such function <code>foo</code> by way of a third function
<code>lose</code> that was compiled without knowledge of this variable (i.e. in a
different source file in which the variable wasn't declared).  This is
because <code>lose</code> might save the register and put some other value there. 
For example, you can't expect a global register variable to be available in
the comparison-function that you pass to <code>qsort</code>, since <code>qsort</code>
might have put something else in that register.  (If you are prepared to
recompile <code>qsort</code> with the same global register variable, you can
solve this problem.)

<p>If you want to recompile <code>qsort</code> or other source files which do not
actually use your global register variable, so that they will not use that
register for any other purpose, then it suffices to specify the compiler
option <code>-ffixed-<var>reg</var></code>.  You need not actually add a global
register declaration to their source code.

<p>A function which can alter the value of a global register variable cannot
safely be called from a function compiled without this variable, because it
could clobber the value the caller expects to find there on return. 
Therefore, the function which is the entry point into the part of the
program that uses the global register variable must explicitly save and
restore the value which belongs to its caller.

<p>On most machines, <code>longjmp</code> will restore to each global register
variable the value it had at the time of the <code>setjmp</code>.  On some
machines, however, <code>longjmp</code> will not change the value of global
register variables.  To be portable, the function that called <code>setjmp</code>
should make other arrangements to save the values of the global register
variables, and to restore them in a <code>longjmp</code>.  This way, the same
thing will happen regardless of what <code>longjmp</code> does.

<p>All global register variable declarations must precede all function
definitions.  If such a declaration could appear after function
definitions, the declaration would be too late to prevent the register from
being used for other purposes in the preceding functions.

<p>Global register variables may not have initial values, because an
executable file has no means to supply initial contents for a register.

<p>On the Sparc, there are reports that g3 <small>...</small> g7 are suitable
registers, but certain library functions, such as <code>getwd</code>, as well
as the subroutines for division and remainder, modify g3 and g4.  g1 and
g2 are local temporaries.

<p>On the 68000, a2 <small>...</small> a5 should be suitable, as should d2 <small>...</small> d7. 
Of course, it will not do to use more than a few of those.

<h3>Specifying Registers for Local Variables</h3>

<p>You can define a local register variable with a specified register
like this:

<pre>register int *foo asm ("a5");
</pre>

<p>Here <code>a5</code> is the name of the register which should be used.  Note
that this is the same syntax used for defining global register
variables, but for a local variable it would appear within a function.

<p>Naturally the register name is cpu-dependent, but this is not a
problem, since specific registers are most often useful with explicit
assembler instructions (see <a href="#Extended%20Asm">Extended Asm</a>).  Both of these things
generally require that you conditionalize your program according to
cpu type.

<p>In addition, operating systems on one type of cpu may differ in how they
name the registers; then you would need additional conditionals.  For
example, some 68000 operating systems call this register <code>%a5</code>.

<p>Defining such a register variable does not reserve the register; it
remains available for other uses in places where flow control determines
the variable's value is not live.  However, these registers are made
unavailable for use in the reload pass; excessive use of this feature
leaves the compiler too few available registers to compile certain
functions.

<p>This option does not guarantee that GNU CC will generate code that has
this variable in the register you specify at all times.  You may not
code an explicit reference to this register in an <code>asm</code> statement
and assume it will always refer to this variable.

<p>Stores into local register variables may be deleted when they appear to be dead
according to dataflow analysis.  References to local register variables may
be deleted or moved or simplified.

<h2>Alternate Keywords</h2>

<p>The option <code>-traditional</code> disables certain keywords; <code>-ansi</code>
disables certain others.  This causes trouble when you want to use GNU C
extensions, or ANSI C features, in a general-purpose header file that
should be usable by all programs, including ANSI C programs and traditional
ones.  The keywords <code>asm</code>, <code>typeof</code> and <code>inline</code> cannot be
used since they won't work in a program compiled with <code>-ansi</code>, while
the keywords <code>const</code>, <code>volatile</code>, <code>signed</code>, <code>typeof</code>
and <code>inline</code> won't work in a program compiled with
<code>-traditional</code>.

<p>The way to solve these problems is to put <code>__</code> at the beginning and
end of each problematical keyword.  For example, use <code>__asm__</code>
instead of <code>asm</code>, <code>__const__</code> instead of <code>const</code>, and
<code>__inline__</code> instead of <code>inline</code>.

<p>Other C compilers won't accept these alternative keywords; if you want to
compile with another compiler, you can define the alternate keywords as
macros to replace them with the customary keywords.  It looks like this:

<pre>#ifndef __GNUC__
#define __asm__ asm
#endif
</pre>

<p><code>-pedantic</code> causes warnings for many GNU C extensions.  You can
prevent such warnings within one expression by writing
<code>__extension__</code> before the expression.  <code>__extension__</code> has no
effect aside from this.

<h2>Incomplete <code>enum</code> Types</h2>

<p>You can define an <code>enum</code> tag without specifying its possible values. 
This results in an incomplete type, much like what you get if you write
<code>struct foo</code> without describing the elements.  A later declaration
which does specify the possible values completes the type.

<p>You can't allocate variables or storage using the type while it is
incomplete.  However, you can work with pointers to that type.

<p>This extension may not be very useful, but it makes the handling of
<code>enum</code> more consistent with the way <code>struct</code> and <code>union</code>
are handled.

<p>This extension is not supported by GNU C++.

<h2>Function Names as Strings</h2>

<p>GNU CC predefines two string variables to be the name of the current function. 
The variable <code>__FUNCTION__</code> is the name of the function as it appears
in the source.  The variable <code>__PRETTY_FUNCTION__</code> is the name of
the function pretty printed in a language specific fashion.

<p>These names are always the same in a C function, but in a C++ function
they may be different.  For example, this program:

<pre>extern "C" {
extern int printf (char *, ...);
}

class a {
 public:
  sub (int i)
    {
      printf ("__FUNCTION__ = %s\n", __FUNCTION__);
      printf ("__PRETTY_FUNCTION__ = %s\n", __PRETTY_FUNCTION__);
    }
};

int
main (void)
{
  a ax;
  ax.sub (0);
  return 0;
}
</pre>

<p>gives this output:

<pre>__FUNCTION__ = sub
__PRETTY_FUNCTION__ = int  a::sub (int)
</pre>

<p>These names are not macros: they are predefined string variables. 
For example, <code>#ifdef __FUNCTION__</code> does not have any special
meaning inside a function, since the preprocessor does not do anything
special with the identifier <code>__FUNCTION__</code>.

<h2>Getting the Return or Frame Address of a Function</h2>

<p>These functions may be used to get information about the callers of a
function.

<dl>
<dt><code>__builtin_return_address (<var>level</var>)</code>
<dd>This function returns the return address of the current function, or of
one of its callers.  The <var>level</var> argument is number of frames to
scan up the call stack.  A value of <code>0</code> yields the return address
of the current function, a value of <code>1</code> yields the return address
of the caller of the current function, and so forth.

<p>The <var>level</var> argument must be a constant integer.

<p>On some machines it may be impossible to determine the return address of
any function other than the current one; in such cases, or when the top
of the stack has been reached, this function will return <code>0</code>.

<p>This function should only be used with a non-zero argument for debugging
purposes.

<br><dt><code>__builtin_frame_address (<var>level</var>)</code>
<dd>This function is similar to <code>__builtin_return_address</code>, but it
returns the address of the function frame rather than the return address
of the function.  Calling <code>__builtin_frame_address</code> with a value of
<code>0</code> yields the frame address of the current function, a value of
<code>1</code> yields the frame address of the caller of the current function,
and so forth.

<p>The frame is the area on the stack which holds local variables and saved
registers.  The frame address is normally the address of the first word
pushed on to the stack by the function.  However, the exact definition
depends upon the processor and the calling convention.  If the processor
has a dedicated frame pointer register, and the function has a frame,
then <code>__builtin_frame_address</code> will return the value of the frame
pointer register.

<p>The caveats that apply to <code>__builtin_return_address</code> apply to this
function as well.

<h2>Other built-in functions provided by GNU CC</h2>

<p>GNU CC provides a large number of built-in functions other than the ones
mentioned above.  Some of these are for internal use in the processing
of exceptions or variable-length argument lists and will not be
documented here because they may change from time to time; we do not
recommend general use of these functions.

<p>The remaining functions are provided for optimization purposes.

<p>GNU CC includes builtin versions of many of the functions in the
standard C library.  These will always be treated as having the same
meaning as the C library function even if you specify the
<code>-fno-builtin</code> (see <a href="#C%20Dialect%20Options">C Dialect Options</a>) option.  These functions
correspond to the C library functions <code>alloca</code>, <code>ffs</code>,
<code>abs</code>, <code>fabsf</code>, <code>fabs</code>, <code>fabsl</code>, <code>labs</code>,
<code>memcpy</code>, <code>memcmp</code>, <code>strcmp</code>, <code>strcpy</code>,
<code>strlen</code>, <code>sqrtf</code>, <code>sqrt</code>, <code>sqrtl</code>, <code>sinf</code>,
<code>sin</code>, <code>sinl</code>, <code>cosf</code>, <code>cos</code>, and <code>cosl</code>.

<p>You can use the builtin function <code>__builtin_constant_p</code> to
determine if a value is known to be constant at compile-time and hence
that GNU CC can perform constant-folding on expressions involving that
value.  The argument of the function is the value to test.  The function
returns the integer 1 if the argument is known to be a compile-time
constant and 0 if it is not known to be a compile-time constant.  A
return of 0 does not indicate that the value is <em>not</em> a constant,
but merely that GNU CC cannot prove it is a constant with the specified
value of the <code>-O</code> option.

<p>You would typically use this function in an embedded application where
memory was a critical resource.  If you have some complex calculation,
you may want it to be folded if it involves constants, but need to call
a function if it does not.  For example:

<pre>#define Scale_Value(X)  \
  (__builtin_constant_p (X) ? ((X) * SCALE + OFFSET) : Scale (X))
</pre>

<p>You may use this builtin function in either a macro or an inline
function.  However, if you use it in an inlined function and pass an
argument of the function as the argument to the builtin, GNU CC will
never return 1 when you call the inline function with a string constant
or constructor expression (see <a href="#Constructors">Constructors</a>) and will not return 1
when you pass a constant numeric value to the inline function unless you
specify the <code>-O</code> option.

<h2>Deprecated Features</h2>

<p>In the past, the GNU C++ compiler was extended to experiment with new
features, at a time when the C++ language was still evolving. Now that
the C++ standard is complete, some of those features are superceded by
superior alternatives. Using the old features might cause a warning in
some cases that the feature will be dropped in the future. In other
cases, the feature might be gone already.

<p>While the list below is not exhaustive, it documents some of the options
that are now deprecated:

<dl>
<dt><code>-fthis-is-variable</code>
<dd>In early versions of C++, assignment to this could be used to implement
application-defined memory allocation. Now, allocation functions
(<code>operator new</code>) are the standard-conforming way to achieve the
same effect.

<br><dt><code>-fexternal-templates</code>
<dt><code>-falt-external-templates</code>
<dd>These are two of the many ways for g++ to implement template
instantiation. See <a href="#Template%20Instantiation">Template Instantiation</a>. The C++ standard clearly
defines how template definitions have to be organized across
implementation units. g++ has an implicit instantiation mechanism that
should work just fine for standard-conforming code.

<h1>Extensions to the C++ Language</h1>

<p>The GNU compiler provides these extensions to the C++ language (and you
can also use most of the C language extensions in your C++ programs).  If you
want to write code that checks whether these features are available, you can
test for the GNU compiler the same way as for C programs: check for a
predefined macro <code>__GNUC__</code>.  You can also use <code>__GNUG__</code> to
test specifically for GNU C++ (see <a href="cpp.info.html#Standard%20Predefined%20Macros">Standard Predefined</a>).

<h2>Named Return Values in C++</h2>

<p>GNU C++ extends the function-definition syntax to allow you to specify a
name for the result of a function outside the body of the definition, in
C++ programs:

<pre><var>type</var>
<var>functionname</var> (<var>args</var>) return <var>resultname</var>;
{
  <small>...</small>
  <var>body</var>
  <small>...</small>
}
</pre>

<p>You can use this feature to avoid an extra constructor call when
a function result has a class type.  For example, consider a function
<code>m</code>, declared as <code>X&nbsp;v&nbsp;=&nbsp;m&nbsp;();</code>, whose result is of class
<code>X</code>:

<pre>X
m ()
{
  X b;
  b.a = 23;
  return b;
}
</pre>

<p>Although <code>m</code> appears to have no arguments, in fact it has one implicit
argument: the address of the return value.  At invocation, the address
of enough space to hold <code>v</code> is sent in as the implicit argument. 
Then <code>b</code> is constructed and its <code>a</code> field is set to the value
23.  Finally, a copy constructor (a constructor of the form <code>X(X&amp;)</code>)
is applied to <code>b</code>, with the (implicit) return value location as the
target, so that <code>v</code> is now bound to the return value.

<p>But this is wasteful.  The local <code>b</code> is declared just to hold
something that will be copied right out.  While a compiler that
combined an "elision" algorithm with interprocedural data flow
analysis could conceivably eliminate all of this, it is much more
practical to allow you to assist the compiler in generating
efficient code by manipulating the return value explicitly,
thus avoiding the local variable and copy constructor altogether.

<p>Using the extended GNU C++ function-definition syntax, you can avoid the
temporary allocation and copying by naming <code>r</code> as your return value
at the outset, and assigning to its <code>a</code> field directly:

<pre>X
m () return r;
{
  r.a = 23;
}
</pre>

<p>The declaration of <code>r</code> is a standard, proper declaration, whose effects
are executed <strong>before</strong> any of the body of <code>m</code>.

<p>Functions of this type impose no additional restrictions; in particular,
you can execute <code>return</code> statements, or return implicitly by
reaching the end of the function body ("falling off the edge"). 
Cases like

<pre>X
m () return r (23);
{
  return;
}
</pre>

<p>(or even <code>X&nbsp;m&nbsp;()&nbsp;return&nbsp;r&nbsp;(23);&nbsp;{&nbsp;}</code>) are unambiguous, since
the return value <code>r</code> has been initialized in either case.  The
following code may be hard to read, but also works predictably:

<pre>X
m () return r;
{
  X b;
  return b;
}
</pre>

<p>The return value slot denoted by <code>r</code> is initialized at the outset,
but the statement <code>return b;</code> overrides this value.  The compiler
deals with this by destroying <code>r</code> (calling the destructor if there
is one, or doing nothing if there is not), and then reinitializing
<code>r</code> with <code>b</code>.

<p>This extension is provided primarily to help people who use overloaded
operators, where there is a great need to control not just the
arguments, but the return values of functions.  For classes where the
copy constructor incurs a heavy performance penalty (especially in the
common case where there is a quick default constructor), this is a major
savings.  The disadvantage of this extension is that you do not control
when the default constructor for the return value is called: it is
always called at the beginning.

<h2>Minimum and Maximum Operators in C++</h2>

<p>It is very convenient to have operators which return the "minimum" or the
"maximum" of two arguments.  In GNU C++ (but not in GNU C),

<dl>
<dt><code><var>a</var> &lt;? <var>b</var></code>
<dd>is the <dfn>minimum</dfn>, returning the smaller of the numeric values
<var>a</var> and <var>b</var>;

<br><dt><code><var>a</var> &gt;? <var>b</var></code>
<dd>is the <dfn>maximum</dfn>, returning the larger of the numeric values <var>a</var>
and <var>b</var>. 
</dl>

<p>These operations are not primitive in ordinary C++, since you can
use a macro to return the minimum of two things in C++, as in the
following example.

<pre>#define MIN(X,Y) ((X) &lt; (Y) ? : (X) : (Y))
</pre>

<p>You might then use <code>int&nbsp;min&nbsp;=&nbsp;MIN&nbsp;(i,&nbsp;j);</code> to set <var>min</var> to
the minimum value of variables <var>i</var> and <var>j</var>.

<p>However, side effects in <code>X</code> or <code>Y</code> may cause unintended
behavior.  For example, <code>MIN (i++, j++)</code> will fail, incrementing
the smaller counter twice.  A GNU C extension allows you to write safe
macros that avoid this kind of problem (see <a href="#Naming%20Types">Naming an Expression's Type</a>).  However, writing <code>MIN</code> and <code>MAX</code> as
macros also forces you to use function-call notation for a
fundamental arithmetic operation.  Using GNU C++ extensions, you can
write <code>int&nbsp;min&nbsp;=&nbsp;i&nbsp;&lt;?&nbsp;j;</code> instead.

<p>Since <code>&lt;?</code> and <code>&gt;?</code> are built into the compiler, they properly
handle expressions with side-effects;  <code>int&nbsp;min&nbsp;=&nbsp;i++&nbsp;&lt;?&nbsp;j++;</code>
works correctly.

<h2><code>goto</code> and Destructors in GNU C++</h2>

<p>In C++ programs, you can safely use the <code>goto</code> statement.  When you
use it to exit a block which contains aggregates requiring destructors,
the destructors will run before the <code>goto</code> transfers control.

<p>The compiler still forbids using <code>goto</code> to <em>enter</em> a scope
that requires constructors.

<h2>Declarations and Definitions in One Header</h2>

<p>C++ object definitions can be quite complex.  In principle, your source
code will need two kinds of things for each object that you use across
more than one source file.  First, you need an <dfn>interface</dfn>
specification, describing its structure with type declarations and
function prototypes.  Second, you need the <dfn>implementation</dfn> itself. 
It can be tedious to maintain a separate interface description in a
header file, in parallel to the actual implementation.  It is also
dangerous, since separate interface and implementation definitions may
not remain parallel.

<p>With GNU C++, you can use a single header file for both purposes.

<blockquote>
<em>Warning:</em> The mechanism to specify this is in transition.  For the
nonce, you must use one of two <code>#pragma</code> commands; in a future
release of GNU C++, an alternative mechanism will make these
<code>#pragma</code> commands unnecessary. 
</blockquote>

<p>The header file contains the full definitions, but is marked with
<code>#pragma interface</code> in the source code.  This allows the compiler
to use the header file only as an interface specification when ordinary
source files incorporate it with <code>#include</code>.  In the single source
file where the full implementation belongs, you can use either a naming
convention or <code>#pragma implementation</code> to indicate this alternate
use of the header file.

<dl>
<dt><code>#pragma interface</code>
<dt><code>#pragma interface "<var>subdir</var>/<var>objects</var>.h"</code>
<dd>Use this directive in <em>header files</em> that define object classes, to save
space in most of the object files that use those classes.  Normally,
local copies of certain information (backup copies of inline member
functions, debugging information, and the internal tables that implement
virtual functions) must be kept in each object file that includes class
definitions.  You can use this pragma to avoid such duplication.  When a
header file containing <code>#pragma interface</code> is included in a
compilation, this auxiliary information will not be generated (unless
the main input source file itself uses <code>#pragma implementation</code>). 
Instead, the object files will contain references to be resolved at link
time.

<p>The second form of this directive is useful for the case where you have
multiple headers with the same name in different directories.  If you
use this form, you must specify the same string to <code>#pragma
implementation</code>.

<br><dt><code>#pragma implementation</code>
<dt><code>#pragma implementation "<var>objects</var>.h"</code>
<dd>Use this pragma in a <em>main input file</em>, when you want full output from
included header files to be generated (and made globally visible).  The
included header file, in turn, should use <code>#pragma interface</code>. 
Backup copies of inline member functions, debugging information, and the
internal tables used to implement virtual functions are all generated in
implementation files.

<p>If you use <code>#pragma implementation</code> with no argument, it applies to
an include file with the same basename<a rel=footnote href="#fn-2"><sup>2</sup></a> as your source
file.  For example, in <code>allclass.cc</code>, giving just
<code>#pragma implementation</code>
by itself is equivalent to <code>#pragma implementation "allclass.h"</code>.

<p>In versions of GNU C++ prior to 2.6.0 <code>allclass.h</code> was treated as
an implementation file whenever you would include it from
<code>allclass.cc</code> even if you never specified <code>#pragma
implementation</code>.  This was deemed to be more trouble than it was worth,
however, and disabled.

<p>If you use an explicit <code>#pragma implementation</code>, it must appear in
your source file <em>before</em> you include the affected header files.

<p>Use the string argument if you want a single implementation file to
include code from multiple header files.  (You must also use
<code>#include</code> to include the header file; <code>#pragma
implementation</code> only specifies how to use the file--it doesn't actually
include it.)

<p>There is no way to split up the contents of a single header file into
multiple implementation files. 
</dl>

<p><code>#pragma implementation</code> and <code>#pragma interface</code> also have an
effect on function inlining.

<p>If you define a class in a header file marked with <code>#pragma
interface</code>, the effect on a function defined in that class is similar to
an explicit <code>extern</code> declaration--the compiler emits no code at
all to define an independent version of the function.  Its definition
is used only for inlining with its callers.

<p>Conversely, when you include the same header file in a main source file
that declares it as <code>#pragma implementation</code>, the compiler emits
code for the function itself; this defines a version of the function
that can be found via pointers (or by callers compiled without
inlining).  If all calls to the function can be inlined, you can avoid
emitting the function by compiling with <code>-fno-implement-inlines</code>. 
If any calls were not inlined, you will get linker errors.

<h2>Where's the Template?</h2>

<p>C++ templates are the first language feature to require more
intelligence from the environment than one usually finds on a UNIX
system.  Somehow the compiler and linker have to make sure that each
template instance occurs exactly once in the executable if it is needed,
and not at all otherwise.  There are two basic approaches to this
problem, which I will refer to as the Borland model and the Cfront model.

<dl>
<dt>Borland model
<dd>Borland C++ solved the template instantiation problem by adding the code
equivalent of common blocks to their linker; the compiler emits template
instances in each translation unit that uses them, and the linker
collapses them together.  The advantage of this model is that the linker
only has to consider the object files themselves; there is no external
complexity to worry about.  This disadvantage is that compilation time
is increased because the template code is being compiled repeatedly. 
Code written for this model tends to include definitions of all
templates in the header file, since they must be seen to be
instantiated.

<br><dt>Cfront model
<dd>The AT&amp;T C++ translator, Cfront, solved the template instantiation
problem by creating the notion of a template repository, an
automatically maintained place where template instances are stored.  A
more modern version of the repository works as follows: As individual
object files are built, the compiler places any template definitions and
instantiations encountered in the repository.  At link time, the link
wrapper adds in the objects in the repository and compiles any needed
instances that were not previously emitted.  The advantages of this
model are more optimal compilation speed and the ability to use the
system linker; to implement the Borland model a compiler vendor also
needs to replace the linker.  The disadvantages are vastly increased
complexity, and thus potential for error; for some code this can be
just as transparent, but in practice it can been very difficult to build
multiple programs in one directory and one program in multiple
directories.  Code written for this model tends to separate definitions
of non-inline member templates into a separate file, which should be
compiled separately. 
</dl>

<p>When used with GNU ld version 2.8 or later on an ELF system such as
Linux/GNU or Solaris 2, or on Microsoft Windows, g++ supports the
Borland model.  On other systems, g++ implements neither automatic
model.

<p>A future version of g++ will support a hybrid model whereby the compiler
will emit any instantiations for which the template definition is
included in the compile, and store template definitions and
instantiation context information into the object file for the rest. 
The link wrapper will extract that information as necessary and invoke
the compiler to produce the remaining instantiations.  The linker will
then combine duplicate instantiations.

<p>In the mean time, you have the following options for dealing with
template instantiations:

<ol type=1 start=1>
</p><li>Compile your template-using code with <code>-frepo</code>.  The compiler will
generate files with the extension <code>.rpo</code> listing all of the
template instantiations used in the corresponding object files which
could be instantiated there; the link wrapper, <code>collect2</code>, will
then update the <code>.rpo</code> files to tell the compiler where to place
those instantiations and rebuild any affected object files.  The
link-time overhead is negligible after the first pass, as the compiler
will continue to place the instantiations in the same files.

<p>This is your best option for application code written for the Borland
model, as it will just work.  Code written for the Cfront model will
need to be modified so that the template definitions are available at
one or more points of instantiation; usually this is as simple as adding
<code>#include &lt;tmethods.cc&gt;</code> to the end of each template header.

<p>For library code, if you want the library to provide all of the template
instantiations it needs, just try to link all of its object files
together; the link will fail, but cause the instantiations to be
generated as a side effect.  Be warned, however, that this may cause
conflicts if multiple libraries try to provide the same instantiations. 
For greater control, use explicit instantiation as described in the next
option.

</p><li>Compile your code with <code>-fno-implicit-templates</code> to disable the
implicit generation of template instances, and explicitly instantiate
all the ones you use.  This approach requires more knowledge of exactly
which instances you need than do the others, but it's less
mysterious and allows greater control.  You can scatter the explicit
instantiations throughout your program, perhaps putting them in the
translation units where the instances are used or the translation units
that define the templates themselves; you can put all of the explicit
instantiations you need into one big file; or you can create small files
like

<pre>#include "Foo.h"
#include "Foo.cc"

template class Foo&lt;int&gt;;
template ostream&amp; operator &lt;&lt;
                (ostream&amp;, const Foo&lt;int&gt;&amp;);
</pre>

<p>for each of the instances you need, and create a template instantiation
library from those.

<p>If you are using Cfront-model code, you can probably get away with not
using <code>-fno-implicit-templates</code> when compiling files that don't
<code>#include</code> the member template definitions.

<p>If you use one big file to do the instantiations, you may want to
compile it without <code>-fno-implicit-templates</code> so you get all of the
instances required by your explicit instantiations (but not by any
other files) without having to specify them as well.

<p>g++ has extended the template instantiation syntax outlined in the
Working Paper to allow forward declaration of explicit instantiations
and instantiation of the compiler support data for a template class
(i.e. the vtable) without instantiating any of its members:

<pre>extern template int max (int, int);
inline template class Foo&lt;int&gt;;
</pre>

</p><li>Do nothing.  Pretend g++ does implement automatic instantiation
management.  Code written for the Borland model will work fine, but
each translation unit will contain instances of each of the templates it
uses.  In a large program, this can lead to an unacceptable amount of code
duplication.

<li>Add <code>#pragma interface</code> to all files containing template
definitions.  For each of these files, add <code>#pragma implementation
"<var>filename</var>"</code> to the top of some <code>.C</code> file which
<code>#include</code>s it.  Then compile everything with
<code>-fexternal-templates</code>.  The templates will then only be expanded
in the translation unit which implements them (i.e. has a <code>#pragma
implementation</code> line for the file where they live); all other files will
use external references.  If you're lucky, everything should work
properly.  If you get undefined symbol errors, you need to make sure
that each template instance which is used in the program is used in the
file which implements that template.  If you don't have any use for a
particular instance in that file, you can just instantiate it
explicitly, using the syntax from the latest C++ working paper:

<pre>template class A&lt;int&gt;;
template ostream&amp; operator &lt;&lt; (ostream&amp;, const A&lt;int&gt;&amp;);
</pre>

<p>This strategy will work with code written for either model.  If you are
using code written for the Cfront model, the file containing a class
template and the file containing its member templates should be
implemented in the same translation unit.

<p>A slight variation on this approach is to instead use the flag
<code>-falt-external-templates</code>; this flag causes template
instances to be emitted in the translation unit that implements the
header where they are first instantiated, rather than the one which
implements the file where the templates are defined.  This header must
be the same in all translation units, or things are likely to break.

<p>See <a href="#C++%20Interface">Declarations and Definitions in One Header</a>, for
more discussion of these pragmas.

<h2>Extracting the function pointer from a bound pointer to member function</h2>

<p>In C++, pointer to member functions (PMFs) are implemented using a wide
pointer of sorts to handle all the possible call mechanisms; the PMF
needs to store information about how to adjust the <code>this</code> pointer,
and if the function pointed to is virtual, where to find the vtable, and
where in the vtable to look for the member function.  If you are using
PMFs in an inner loop, you should really reconsider that decision.  If
that is not an option, you can extract the pointer to the function that
would be called for a given object/PMF pair and call it directly inside
the inner loop, to save a bit of time.

<p>Note that you will still be paying the penalty for the call through a
function pointer; on most modern architectures, such a call defeats the
branch prediction features of the CPU.  This is also true of normal
virtual function calls.

<p>The syntax for this extension is

<pre>extern A a;
extern int (A::*fp)();
typedef int (*fptr)(A *);

fptr p = (fptr)(a.*fp);
</pre>

<p>You must specify <code>-Wno-pmf-conversions</code> to use this extension.

<h2>Type Abstraction using Signatures</h2>

<p>In GNU C++, you can use the keyword <code>signature</code> to define a
completely abstract class interface as a datatype.  You can connect this
abstraction with actual classes using signature pointers.  If you want
to use signatures, run the GNU compiler with the
<code>-fhandle-signatures</code> command-line option.  (With this option, the
compiler reserves a second keyword <code>sigof</code> as well, for a future
extension.)

<p>Roughly, signatures are type abstractions or interfaces of classes. 
Some other languages have similar facilities.  C++ signatures are
related to ML's signatures, Haskell's type classes, definition modules
in Modula-2, interface modules in Modula-3, abstract types in Emerald,
type modules in Trellis/Owl, categories in Scratchpad II, and types in
POOL-I.  For a more detailed discussion of signatures, see
<cite>Signatures: A Language Extension for Improving Type Abstraction and
Subtype Polymorphism in C++</cite>
by Gerald Baumgartner and Vincent F. Russo (Tech report
CSD-TR-95-051, Dept. of Computer Sciences, Purdue University,
August 1995, a slightly improved version appeared in
<em>Software--Practice &amp; Experience</em>, <b>25</b>(8), pp. 863-889,
August 1995).  You can get the tech report by anonymous FTP from
<code>ftp.cs.purdue.edu</code> in <code>pub/gb/Signature-design.ps.gz</code>.

<p>Syntactically, a signature declaration is a collection of
member function declarations and nested type declarations. 
For example, this signature declaration defines a new abstract type
<code>S</code> with member functions <code>int foo ()</code> and <code>int bar (int)</code>:

<pre>signature S
{
  int foo ();
  int bar (int);
};
</pre>

<p>Since signature types do not include implementation definitions, you
cannot write an instance of a signature directly.  Instead, you can
define a pointer to any class that contains the required interfaces as a
<dfn>signature pointer</dfn>.  Such a class <dfn>implements</dfn> the signature
type.

<p>To use a class as an implementation of <code>S</code>, you must ensure that
the class has public member functions <code>int foo ()</code> and <code>int
bar (int)</code>.  The class can have other member functions as well, public
or not; as long as it offers what's declared in the signature, it is
suitable as an implementation of that signature type.

<p>For example, suppose that <code>C</code> is a class that meets the
requirements of signature <code>S</code> (<code>C</code> <dfn>conforms to</dfn>
<code>S</code>).  Then

<pre>C obj;
S * p = &amp;obj;
</pre>

<p>defines a signature pointer <code>p</code> and initializes it to point to an
object of type <code>C</code>. 
The member function call <code>int&nbsp;i&nbsp;=&nbsp;p-&gt;foo&nbsp;();</code>
executes <code>obj.foo ()</code>.

<p>Abstract virtual classes provide somewhat similar facilities in standard
C++.  There are two main advantages to using signatures instead:

<ol type=1 start=1>
</p><li>Subtyping becomes independent from inheritance.  A class or signature
type <code>T</code> is a subtype of a signature type <code>S</code> independent of
any inheritance hierarchy as long as all the member functions declared
in <code>S</code> are also found in <code>T</code>.  So you can define a subtype
hierarchy that is completely independent from any inheritance
(implementation) hierarchy, instead of being forced to use types that
mirror the class inheritance hierarchy.

<li>Signatures allow you to work with existing class hierarchies as
implementations of a signature type.  If those class hierarchies are
only available in compiled form, you're out of luck with abstract virtual
classes, since an abstract virtual class cannot be retrofitted on top of
existing class hierarchies.  So you would be required to write interface
classes as subtypes of the abstract virtual class.
</ol>

<p>There is one more detail about signatures.  A signature declaration can
contain member function <em>definitions</em> as well as member function
declarations.  A signature member function with a full definition is
called a <em>default implementation</em>; classes need not contain that
particular interface in order to conform.  For example, a
class <code>C</code> can conform to the signature

<pre>signature T
{
  int f (int);
  int f0 () { return f (0); };
};
</pre>

<p>whether or not <code>C</code> implements the member function <code>int f0 ()</code>. 
If you define <code>C::f0</code>, that definition takes precedence;
otherwise, the default implementation <code>S::f0</code> applies.

<h1><code>gcov</code>: a Test Coverage Program</h1>

<h2>Introduction to <code>gcov</code></h2>

<p><code>gcov</code> is a test coverage program.  Use it in concert with <small>GNU</small>
CC to analyze your programs to help create more efficient, faster
running code.  You can use <code>gcov</code> as a profiling tool to help
discover where your optimization efforts will best affect your code.  You
can also use <code>gcov</code> along with the other profiling tool,
<code>gprof</code>, to assess which parts of your code use the greatest amount
of computing time.

<p>Profiling tools help you analyze your code's performance.  Using a
profiler such as <code>gcov</code> or <code>gprof</code>, you can find out some
basic performance statistics, such as:

<ul>
<li>how often each line of code executes

<li>what lines of code are actually executed

<li>how much computing time each section of code uses
</ul>

<p>Once you know these things about how your code works when compiled, you
can look at each module to see which modules should be optimized. 
<code>gcov</code> helps you determine where to work on optimization.

<p>Software developers also use coverage testing in concert with
testsuites, to make sure software is actually good enough for a release. 
Testsuites can verify that a program works as expected; a coverage
program tests to see how much of the program is exercised by the
testsuite.  Developers can then determine what kinds of test cases need
to be added to the testsuites to create both better testing and a better
final product.

<p>You should compile your code without optimization if you plan to use
<code>gcov</code> because the optimization, by combining some lines of code
into one function, may not give you as much information as you need to
look for `hot spots' where the code is using a great deal of computer
time.  Likewise, because <code>gcov</code> accumulates statistics by line (at
the lowest resolution), it works best with a programming style that
places only one statement on each line.  If you use complicated macros
that expand to loops or to other control structures, the statistics are
less helpful--they only report on the line where the macro call
appears.  If your complex macros behave like functions, you can replace
them with inline functions to solve this problem.

<p><code>gcov</code> creates a logfile called <code><var>sourcefile</var>.gcov</code> which
indicates how many times each line of a source file <code><var>sourcefile</var>.c</code>
has executed.  You can use these logfiles along with <code>gprof</code> to aid
in fine-tuning the performance of your programs.  <code>gprof</code> gives
timing information you can use along with the information you get from
<code>gcov</code>.

<p><code>gcov</code> works only on code compiled with <small>GNU</small> CC.  It is not
compatible with any other profiling or test coverage mechanism.

<h2>Invoking gcov</h2>

<pre>gcov [-b] [-v] [-n] [-l] [-f] [-o directory] <var>sourcefile</var>
</pre>

<dl>
<dt><code>-b</code>
<dd>Write branch frequencies to the output file, and write branch summary
info to the standard output.  This option allows you to see how often
each branch in your program was taken.

<br><dt><code>-v</code>
<dd>Display the <code>gcov</code> version number (on the standard error stream).

<br><dt><code>-n</code>
<dd>Do not create the <code>gcov</code> output file.

<br><dt><code>-l</code>
<dd>Create long file names for included source files.  For example, if the
header file <code>x.h</code> contains code, and was included in the file
<code>a.c</code>, then running <code>gcov</code> on the file <code>a.c</code> will produce
an output file called <code>a.c.x.h.gcov</code> instead of <code>x.h.gcov</code>. 
This can be useful if <code>x.h</code> is included in multiple source files.

<br><dt><code>-f</code>
<dd>Output summaries for each function in addition to the file level summary.

<br><dt><code>-o</code>
<dd>The directory where the object files live.  Gcov will search for <code>.bb</code>,
<code>.bbg</code>, and <code>.da</code> files in this directory. 
</dl>

<p>When using <code>gcov</code>, you must first compile your program with two
special <small>GNU</small> CC options: <code>-fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage</code>. 
This tells the compiler to generate additional information needed by
gcov (basically a flow graph of the program) and also includes
additional code in the object files for generating the extra profiling
information needed by gcov.  These additional files are placed in the
directory where the source code is located.

<p>Running the program will cause profile output to be generated.  For each
source file compiled with -fprofile-arcs, an accompanying <code>.da</code>
file will be placed in the source directory.

<p>Running <code>gcov</code> with your program's source file names as arguments
will now produce a listing of the code along with frequency of execution
for each line.  For example, if your program is called <code>tmp.c</code>, this
is what you see when you use the basic <code>gcov</code> facility:

<pre>$ gcc -fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage tmp.c
$ a.out
$ gcov tmp.c
 87.50% of 8 source lines executed in file tmp.c
Creating tmp.c.gcov.
</pre>

<p>The file <code>tmp.c.gcov</code> contains output from <code>gcov</code>. 
Here is a sample:

<pre>                main()
                {
           1      int i, total;

           1      total = 0;

          11      for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)
          10        total += i;

           1      if (total != 45)
      ######        printf ("Failure\n");
                  else
           1        printf ("Success\n");
           1    }
</pre>

<p>When you use the <code>-b</code> option, your output looks like this:

<pre>$ gcov -b tmp.c
 87.50% of 8 source lines executed in file tmp.c
 80.00% of 5 branches executed in file tmp.c
 80.00% of 5 branches taken at least once in file tmp.c
 50.00% of 2 calls executed in file tmp.c
Creating tmp.c.gcov.
</pre>

<p>Here is a sample of a resulting <code>tmp.c.gcov</code> file:

<pre>                main()
                {
           1      int i, total;

           1      total = 0;

          11      for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)
branch 0 taken = 91%
branch 1 taken = 100%
branch 2 taken = 100%
          10        total += i;

           1      if (total != 45)
branch 0 taken = 100%
      ######        printf ("Failure\n");
call 0 never executed
branch 1 never executed
                  else
           1        printf ("Success\n");
call 0 returns = 100%
           1    }
</pre>

<p>For each basic block, a line is printed after the last line of the basic
block describing the branch or call that ends the basic block.  There can
be multiple branches and calls listed for a single source line if there
are multiple basic blocks that end on that line.  In this case, the
branches and calls are each given a number.  There is no simple way to map
these branches and calls back to source constructs.  In general, though,
the lowest numbered branch or call will correspond to the leftmost construct
on the source line.

<p>For a branch, if it was executed at least once, then a percentage
indicating the number of times the branch was taken divided by the
number of times the branch was executed will be printed.  Otherwise, the
message "never executed" is printed.

<p>For a call, if it was executed at least once, then a percentage
indicating the number of times the call returned divided by the number
of times the call was executed will be printed.  This will usually be
100%, but may be less for functions call <code>exit</code> or <code>longjmp</code>,
and thus may not return everytime they are called.

<p>The execution counts are cumulative.  If the example program were
executed again without removing the <code>.da</code> file, the count for the
number of times each line in the source was executed would be added to
the results of the previous run(s).  This is potentially useful in
several ways.  For example, it could be used to accumulate data over a
number of program runs as part of a test verification suite, or to
provide more accurate long-term information over a large number of
program runs.

<p>The data in the <code>.da</code> files is saved immediately before the program
exits.  For each source file compiled with -fprofile-arcs, the profiling
code first attempts to read in an existing <code>.da</code> file; if the file
doesn't match the executable (differing number of basic block counts) it
will ignore the contents of the file.  It then adds in the new execution
counts and finally writes the data to the file.

<h2>Using <code>gcov</code> with GCC Optimization</h2>

<p>If you plan to use <code>gcov</code> to help optimize your code, you must
first compile your program with two special <small>GNU</small> CC options:
<code>-fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage</code>.  Aside from that, you can use any
other <small>GNU</small> CC options; but if you want to prove that every single line
in your program was executed, you should not compile with optimization
at the same time.  On some machines the optimizer can eliminate some
simple code lines by combining them with other lines.  For example, code
like this:

<pre>if (a != b)
  c = 1;
else
  c = 0;
</pre>

<p>can be compiled into one instruction on some machines.  In this case,
there is no way for <code>gcov</code> to calculate separate execution counts
for each line because there isn't separate code for each line.  Hence
the <code>gcov</code> output looks like this if you compiled the program with
optimization:

<pre>      100  if (a != b)
      100    c = 1;
      100  else
      100    c = 0;
</pre>

<p>The output shows that this block of code, combined by optimization,
executed 100 times.  In one sense this result is correct, because there
was only one instruction representing all four of these lines.  However,
the output does not indicate how many times the result was 0 and how
many times the result was 1.

<h2>Brief description of <code>gcov</code> data files</h2>

<p><code>gcov</code> uses three files for doing profiling.  The names of these
files are derived from the original <em>source</em> file by substituting
the file suffix with either <code>.bb</code>, <code>.bbg</code>, or <code>.da</code>.  All
of these files are placed in the same directory as the source file, and
contain data stored in a platform-independent method.

<p>The <code>.bb</code> and <code>.bbg</code> files are generated when the source file
is compiled with the <small>GNU</small> CC <code>-ftest-coverage</code> option.  The
<code>.bb</code> file contains a list of source files (including headers),
functions within those files, and line numbers corresponding to each
basic block in the source file.

<p>The <code>.bb</code> file format consists of several lists of 4-byte integers
which correspond to the line numbers of each basic block in the
file.  Each list is terminated by a line number of 0.  A line number of -1
is used to designate that the source file name (padded to a 4-byte
boundary and followed by another -1) follows.  In addition, a line number
of -2 is used to designate that the name of a function (also padded to a
4-byte boundary and followed by a -2) follows.

<p>The <code>.bbg</code> file is used to reconstruct the program flow graph for
the source file.  It contains a list of the program flow arcs (possible
branches taken from one basic block to another) for each function which,
in combination with the <code>.bb</code> file, enables gcov to reconstruct the
program flow.

<p>In the <code>.bbg</code> file, the format is:
<pre>        number of basic blocks for function #0 (4-byte number)
        total number of arcs for function #0 (4-byte number)
        count of arcs in basic block #0 (4-byte number)
        destination basic block of arc #0 (4-byte number)
        flag bits (4-byte number)
        destination basic block of arc #1 (4-byte number)
        flag bits (4-byte number)
        ...
        destination basic block of arc #N (4-byte number)
        flag bits (4-byte number)
        count of arcs in basic block #1 (4-byte number)
        destination basic block of arc #0 (4-byte number)
        flag bits (4-byte number)
        ...
</pre>

<p>A -1 (stored as a 4-byte number) is used to separate each function's
list of basic blocks, and to verify that the file has been read
correctly.

<p>The <code>.da</code> file is generated when a program containing object files
built with the <small>GNU</small> CC <code>-fprofile-arcs</code> option is executed.  A
separate <code>.da</code> file is created for each source file compiled with
this option, and the name of the <code>.da</code> file is stored as an
absolute pathname in the resulting object file.  This path name is
derived from the source file name by substituting a <code>.da</code> suffix.

<p>The format of the <code>.da</code> file is fairly simple.  The first 8-byte
number is the number of counts in the file, followed by the counts
(stored as 8-byte numbers).  Each count corresponds to the number of
times each arc in the program is executed.  The counts are cumulative;
each time the program is executed, it attemps to combine the existing
<code>.da</code> files with the new counts for this invocation of the
program.  It ignores the contents of any <code>.da</code> files whose number of
arcs doesn't correspond to the current program, and merely overwrites
them instead.

<p>All three of these files use the functions in <code>gcov-io.h</code> to store
integers; the functions in this header provide a machine-independent
mechanism for storing and retrieving data from a stream.

of these are not GCC bugs per se--if they were, we would fix them. 
But the result for a user may be like the result of a bug.

<p>Some of these problems are due to bugs in other software, some are
missing features that are too much work to add, and some are places
where people's opinions differ as to what is best.

<h2>Actual Bugs We Haven't Fixed Yet</h2>

<ul>
<li>The <code>fixincludes</code> script interacts badly with automounters; if the
directory of system header files is automounted, it tends to be
unmounted while <code>fixincludes</code> is running.  This would seem to be a
bug in the automounter.  We don't know any good way to work around it.

<li>The <code>fixproto</code> script will sometimes add prototypes for the
<code>sigsetjmp</code> and <code>siglongjmp</code> functions that reference the
<code>jmp_buf</code> type before that type is defined.  To work around this,
edit the offending file and place the typedef in front of the
prototypes.

<li>There are several obscure case of mis-using struct, union, and
enum tags that are not detected as errors by the compiler.

<li>When <code>-pedantic-errors</code> is specified, GCC will incorrectly give
an error message when a function name is specified in an expression
involving the comma operator.

<li>Loop unrolling doesn't work properly for certain C++ programs.  This is
a bug in the C++ front end.  It sometimes emits incorrect debug info, and
the loop unrolling code is unable to recover from this error.

<h2>Installation Problems</h2>

<p>This is a list of problems (and some apparent problems which don't
really mean anything is wrong) that show up during installation of GNU
CC.

<ul>
<li>On certain systems, defining certain environment variables such as
<code>CC</code> can interfere with the functioning of <code>make</code>.

<li>If you encounter seemingly strange errors when trying to build the
compiler in a directory other than the source directory, it could be
because you have previously configured the compiler in the source
directory.  Make sure you have done all the necessary preparations. 
See <a href="#Other%20Dir">Other Dir</a>.

<li>If you build GCC on a BSD system using a directory stored in a System
V file system, problems may occur in running <code>fixincludes</code> if the
System V file system doesn't support symbolic links.  These problems
result in a failure to fix the declaration of <code>size_t</code> in
<code>sys/types.h</code>.  If you find that <code>size_t</code> is a signed type and
that type mismatches occur, this could be the cause.

<p>The solution is not to use such a directory for building GCC.

</p><li>In previous versions of GCC, the <code>gcc</code> driver program looked for
<code>as</code> and <code>ld</code> in various places; for example, in files
beginning with <code>/usr/local/lib/gcc-</code>.  GCC version 2 looks for
them in the directory
<code>/usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/<var>target</var>/<var>version</var></code>.

<p>Thus, to use a version of <code>as</code> or <code>ld</code> that is not the system
default, for example <code>gas</code> or GNU <code>ld</code>, you must put them in
that directory (or make links to them from that directory).

</p><li>Some commands executed when making the compiler may fail (return a
non-zero status) and be ignored by <code>make</code>.  These failures, which
are often due to files that were not found, are expected, and can safely
be ignored.

<li>It is normal to have warnings in compiling certain files about
unreachable code and about enumeration type clashes.  These files' names
begin with <code>insn-</code>.  Also, <code>real.c</code> may get some warnings that
you can ignore.

<li>Sometimes <code>make</code> recompiles parts of the compiler when installing
the compiler.  In one case, this was traced down to a bug in
<code>make</code>.  Either ignore the problem or switch to GNU Make.

<li>If you have installed a program known as purify, you may find that it
causes errors while linking <code>enquire</code>, which is part of building
GCC.  The fix is to get rid of the file <code>real-ld</code> which purify
installs--so that GCC won't try to use it.

<li>On GNU/Linux SLS 1.01, there is a problem with <code>libc.a</code>: it does not
contain the obstack functions.  However, GCC assumes that the obstack
functions are in <code>libc.a</code> when it is the GNU C library.  To work
around this problem, change the <code>__GNU_LIBRARY__</code> conditional
around line 31 to <code>#if 1</code>.

<li>On some 386 systems, building the compiler never finishes because
<code>enquire</code> hangs due to a hardware problem in the motherboard--it
reports floating point exceptions to the kernel incorrectly.  You can
install GCC except for <code>float.h</code> by patching out the command to
run <code>enquire</code>.  You may also be able to fix the problem for real by
getting a replacement motherboard.  This problem was observed in
Revision E of the Micronics motherboard, and is fixed in Revision F. 
It has also been observed in the MYLEX MXA-33 motherboard.

<p>If you encounter this problem, you may also want to consider removing
the FPU from the socket during the compilation.  Alternatively, if you
are running SCO Unix, you can reboot and force the FPU to be ignored. 
To do this, type <code>hd(40)unix auto ignorefpu</code>.

</p><li>On some 386 systems, GCC crashes trying to compile <code>enquire.c</code>. 
This happens on machines that don't have a 387 FPU chip.  On 386
machines, the system kernel is supposed to emulate the 387 when you
don't have one.  The crash is due to a bug in the emulator.

<p>One of these systems is the Unix from Interactive Systems: 386/ix. 
On this system, an alternate emulator is provided, and it does work. 
To use it, execute this command as super-user:

<pre>ln /etc/emulator.rel1 /etc/emulator
</pre>

<p>and then reboot the system.  (The default emulator file remains present
under the name <code>emulator.dflt</code>.)

<p>Try using <code>/etc/emulator.att</code>, if you have such a problem on the
SCO system.

<p>Another system which has this problem is Esix.  We don't know whether it
has an alternate emulator that works.

<p>On NetBSD 0.8, a similar problem manifests itself as these error messages:

<pre>enquire.c: In function `fprop':
enquire.c:2328: floating overflow
</pre>

</p><li>On SCO systems, when compiling GCC with the system's compiler,
do not use <code>-O</code>.  Some versions of the system's compiler miscompile
GCC with <code>-O</code>.

<li>Sometimes on a Sun 4 you may observe a crash in the program
<code>genflags</code> or <code>genoutput</code> while building GCC.  This is said to
be due to a bug in <code>sh</code>.  You can probably get around it by running
<code>genflags</code> or <code>genoutput</code> manually and then retrying the
<code>make</code>.

<li>On Solaris 2, executables of GCC version 2.0.2 are commonly
available, but they have a bug that shows up when compiling current
versions of GCC: undefined symbol errors occur during assembly if you
use <code>-g</code>.

<p>The solution is to compile the current version of GCC without
<code>-g</code>.  That makes a working compiler which you can use to recompile
with <code>-g</code>.

</p><li>Solaris 2 comes with a number of optional OS packages.  Some of these
packages are needed to use GCC fully.  If you did not install all
optional packages when installing Solaris, you will need to verify that
the packages that GCC needs are installed.

<p>To check whether an optional package is installed, use
the <code>pkginfo</code> command.  To add an optional package, use the
<code>pkgadd</code> command.  For further details, see the Solaris
documentation.

<p>For Solaris 2.0 and 2.1, GCC needs six packages: <code>SUNWarc</code>,
<code>SUNWbtool</code>, <code>SUNWesu</code>, <code>SUNWhea</code>, <code>SUNWlibm</code>, and
<code>SUNWtoo</code>.

<p>For Solaris 2.2, GCC needs an additional seventh package: <code>SUNWsprot</code>.

</p><li>On Solaris 2, trying to use the linker and other tools in
<code>/usr/ucb</code> to install GCC has been observed to cause trouble. 
For example, the linker may hang indefinitely.  The fix is to remove
<code>/usr/ucb</code> from your <code>PATH</code>.

<li>If you use the 1.31 version of the MIPS assembler (such as was shipped
with Ultrix 3.1), you will need to use the -fno-delayed-branch switch
when optimizing floating point code.  Otherwise, the assembler will
complain when the GCC compiler fills a branch delay slot with a
floating point instruction, such as <code>add.d</code>.

<li>If on a MIPS system you get an error message saying "does not have gp
sections for all it's [sic] sectons [sic]", don't worry about it.  This
happens whenever you use GAS with the MIPS linker, but there is not
really anything wrong, and it is okay to use the output file.  You can
stop such warnings by installing the GNU linker.

<p>It would be nice to extend GAS to produce the gp tables, but they are
optional, and there should not be a warning about their absence.

</p><li>In Ultrix 4.0 on the MIPS machine, <code>stdio.h</code> does not work with GNU
CC at all unless it has been fixed with <code>fixincludes</code>.  This causes
problems in building GCC.  Once GCC is installed, the problems go
away.

<p>To work around this problem, when making the stage 1 compiler, specify
this option to Make:

<pre>GCC_FOR_TARGET="./xgcc -B./ -I./include"
</pre>

<p>When making stage 2 and stage 3, specify this option:

<pre>CFLAGS="-g -I./include"
</pre>

</p><li>Users have reported some problems with version 2.0 of the MIPS
compiler tools that were shipped with Ultrix 4.1.  Version 2.10
which came with Ultrix 4.2 seems to work fine.

<p>Users have also reported some problems with version 2.20 of the
MIPS compiler tools that were shipped with RISC/os 4.x.  The earlier
version 2.11 seems to work fine.

</p><li>Some versions of the MIPS linker will issue an assertion failure
when linking code that uses <code>alloca</code> against shared
libraries on RISC-OS 5.0, and DEC's OSF/1 systems.  This is a bug
in the linker, that is supposed to be fixed in future revisions. 
To protect against this, GCC passes <code>-non_shared</code> to the
linker unless you pass an explicit <code>-shared</code> or
<code>-call_shared</code> switch.

<li>On System V release 3, you may get this error message
while linking:

<pre>ld fatal: failed to write symbol name <var>something</var>
 in strings table for file <var>whatever</var>
</pre>

<p>This probably indicates that the disk is full or your ULIMIT won't allow
the file to be as large as it needs to be.

<p>This problem can also result because the kernel parameter <code>MAXUMEM</code>
is too small.  If so, you must regenerate the kernel and make the value
much larger.  The default value is reported to be 1024; a value of 32768
is said to work.  Smaller values may also work.

</p><li>On System V, if you get an error like this,

<pre>/usr/local/lib/bison.simple: In function `yyparse':
/usr/local/lib/bison.simple:625: virtual memory exhausted
</pre>

<p>that too indicates a problem with disk space, ULIMIT, or <code>MAXUMEM</code>.

</p><li>Current GCC versions probably do not work on version 2 of the NeXT
operating system.

<li>On NeXTStep 3.0, the Objective C compiler does not work, due,
apparently, to a kernel bug that it happens to trigger.  This problem
does not happen on 3.1.

<li>On the Tower models 4<var>n</var>0 and 6<var>n</var>0, by default a process is not
allowed to have more than one megabyte of memory.  GCC cannot compile
itself (or many other programs) with <code>-O</code> in that much memory.

<p>To solve this problem, reconfigure the kernel adding the following line
to the configuration file:

<pre>MAXUMEM = 4096
</pre>

</p><li>On HP 9000 series 300 or 400 running HP-UX release 8.0, there is a bug
in the assembler that must be fixed before GCC can be built.  This
bug manifests itself during the first stage of compilation, while
building <code>libgcc2.a</code>:

<pre>_floatdisf
cc1: warning: `-g' option not supported on this version of GCC
cc1: warning: `-g1' option not supported on this version of GCC
./xgcc: Internal compiler error: program as got fatal signal 11
</pre>

<p>A patched version of the assembler is available by anonymous ftp from
<code>altdorf.ai.mit.edu</code> as the file
<code>archive/cph/hpux-8.0-assembler</code>.  If you have HP software support,
the patch can also be obtained directly from HP, as described in the
following note:

<blockquote>
This is the patched assembler, to patch SR#1653-010439, where the
assembler aborts on floating point constants.

<p>The bug is not really in the assembler, but in the shared library
version of the function "cvtnum(3c)".  The bug on "cvtnum(3c)" is
SR#4701-078451.  Anyway, the attached assembler uses the archive
library version of "cvtnum(3c)" and thus does not exhibit the bug. 
</blockquote>

<p>This patch is also known as PHCO_4484.

</p><li>On HP-UX version 8.05, but not on 8.07 or more recent versions,
the <code>fixproto</code> shell script triggers a bug in the system shell. 
If you encounter this problem, upgrade your operating system or
use BASH (the GNU shell) to run <code>fixproto</code>.

<li>Some versions of the Pyramid C compiler are reported to be unable to
compile GCC.  You must use an older version of GCC for
bootstrapping.  One indication of this problem is if you get a crash
when GCC compiles the function <code>muldi3</code> in file <code>libgcc2.c</code>.

<p>You may be able to succeed by getting GCC version 1, installing it,
and using it to compile GCC version 2.  The bug in the Pyramid C
compiler does not seem to affect GCC version 1.

</p><li>There may be similar problems on System V Release 3.1 on 386 systems.

<li>On the Intel Paragon (an i860 machine), if you are using operating
system version 1.0, you will get warnings or errors about redefinition
of <code>va_arg</code> when you build GCC.

<p>If this happens, then you need to link most programs with the library
<code>iclib.a</code>.  You must also modify <code>stdio.h</code> as follows: before
the lines

<pre>#if     defined(__i860__) &amp;&amp; !defined(_VA_LIST)
#include &lt;va_list.h&gt;
</pre>

<p>insert the line

<pre>#if __PGC__
</pre>

<p>and after the lines

<pre>extern int  vprintf(const char *, va_list );
extern int  vsprintf(char *, const char *, va_list );
#endif
</pre>

<p>insert the line

<pre>#endif /* __PGC__ */
</pre>

<p>These problems don't exist in operating system version 1.1.

</p><li>On the Altos 3068, programs compiled with GCC won't work unless you
fix a kernel bug.  This happens using system versions V.2.2 1.0gT1 and
V.2.2 1.0e and perhaps later versions as well.  See the file
<code>README.ALTOS</code>.

<li>You will get several sorts of compilation and linking errors on the
we32k if you don't follow the special instructions.  See <a href="#Configurations">Configurations</a>.

<li>A bug in the HP-UX 8.05 (and earlier) shell will cause the fixproto
program to report an error of the form:

<pre>./fixproto: sh internal 1K buffer overflow
</pre>

<p>To fix this, change the first line of the fixproto script to look like:

<pre>#!/bin/ksh
</pre>
</ul>

<h2>Cross-Compiler Problems</h2>

<p>You may run into problems with cross compilation on certain machines,
for several reasons.

<ul>
<li>Cross compilation can run into trouble for certain machines because
some target machines' assemblers require floating point numbers to be
written as <em>integer</em> constants in certain contexts.

<p>The compiler writes these integer constants by examining the floating
point value as an integer and printing that integer, because this is
simple to write and independent of the details of the floating point
representation.  But this does not work if the compiler is running on
a different machine with an incompatible floating point format, or
even a different byte-ordering.

<p>In addition, correct constant folding of floating point values
requires representing them in the target machine's format. 
(The C standard does not quite require this, but in practice
it is the only way to win.)

<p>It is now possible to overcome these problems by defining macros such
as <code>REAL_VALUE_TYPE</code>.  But doing so is a substantial amount of
work for each target machine. 
See <a href="#Cross-compilation">Cross-compilation</a>.

</p><li>At present, the program <code>mips-tfile</code> which adds debug
support to object files on MIPS systems does not work in a cross
compile environment. 
</ul>

<br>

<h2>Interoperation</h2>

<p>This section lists various difficulties encountered in using GNU C or
GNU C++ together with other compilers or with the assemblers, linkers,
libraries and debuggers on certain systems.

<ul>
<li>Objective C does not work on the RS/6000.

<li>GNU C++ does not do name mangling in the same way as other C++
compilers.  This means that object files compiled with one compiler
cannot be used with another.

<p>This effect is intentional, to protect you from more subtle problems. 
Compilers differ as to many internal details of C++ implementation,
including: how class instances are laid out, how multiple inheritance is
implemented, and how virtual function calls are handled.  If the name
encoding were made the same, your programs would link against libraries
provided from other compilers--but the programs would then crash when
run.  Incompatible libraries are then detected at link time, rather than
at run time.

</p><li>Older GDB versions sometimes fail to read the output of GCC version
2.  If you have trouble, get GDB version 4.4 or later.

<li>DBX rejects some files produced by GCC, though it accepts similar
constructs in output from PCC.  Until someone can supply a coherent
description of what is valid DBX input and what is not, there is
nothing I can do about these problems.  You are on your own.

<li>The GNU assembler (GAS) does not support PIC.  To generate PIC code, you
must use some other assembler, such as <code>/bin/as</code>.

<li>On some BSD systems, including some versions of Ultrix, use of profiling
causes static variable destructors (currently used only in C++) not to
be run.

<li>Use of <code>-I/usr/include</code> may cause trouble.

<p>Many systems come with header files that won't work with GCC unless
corrected by <code>fixincludes</code>.  The corrected header files go in a new
directory; GCC searches this directory before <code>/usr/include</code>. 
If you use <code>-I/usr/include</code>, this tells GCC to search
<code>/usr/include</code> earlier on, before the corrected headers.  The
result is that you get the uncorrected header files.

<p>Instead, you should use these options (when compiling C programs):

<pre>-I/usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/<var>target</var>/<var>version</var>/include -I/usr/include
</pre>

<p>For C++ programs, GCC also uses a special directory that defines C++
interfaces to standard C subroutines.  This directory is meant to be
searched <em>before</em> other standard include directories, so that it
takes precedence.  If you are compiling C++ programs and specifying
include directories explicitly, use this option first, then the two
options above:

<pre>-I/usr/local/lib/g++-include
</pre>

</p><li>On some SGI systems, when you use <code>-lgl_s</code> as an option,
it gets translated magically to <code>-lgl_s -lX11_s -lc_s</code>. 
Naturally, this does not happen when you use GCC. 
You must specify all three options explicitly.

<li>On a Sparc, GCC aligns all values of type <code>double</code> on an 8-byte
boundary, and it expects every <code>double</code> to be so aligned.  The Sun
compiler usually gives <code>double</code> values 8-byte alignment, with one
exception: function arguments of type <code>double</code> may not be aligned.

<p>As a result, if a function compiled with Sun CC takes the address of an
argument of type <code>double</code> and passes this pointer of type
<code>double *</code> to a function compiled with GCC, dereferencing the
pointer may cause a fatal signal.

<p>One way to solve this problem is to compile your entire program with GNU
CC.  Another solution is to modify the function that is compiled with
Sun CC to copy the argument into a local variable; local variables
are always properly aligned.  A third solution is to modify the function
that uses the pointer to dereference it via the following function
<code>access_double</code> instead of directly with <code>*</code>:

<pre>inline double
access_double (double *unaligned_ptr)
{
  union d2i { double d; int i[2]; };

  union d2i *p = (union d2i *) unaligned_ptr;
  union d2i u;

  u.i[0] = p-&gt;i[0];
  u.i[1] = p-&gt;i[1];

  return u.d;
}
</pre>

<p>Storing into the pointer can be done likewise with the same union.

</p><li>On Solaris, the <code>malloc</code> function in the <code>libmalloc.a</code> library
may allocate memory that is only 4 byte aligned.  Since GCC on the
Sparc assumes that doubles are 8 byte aligned, this may result in a
fatal signal if doubles are stored in memory allocated by the
<code>libmalloc.a</code> library.

<p>The solution is to not use the <code>libmalloc.a</code> library.  Use instead
<code>malloc</code> and related functions from <code>libc.a</code>; they do not have
this problem.

</p><li>Sun forgot to include a static version of <code>libdl.a</code> with some
versions of SunOS (mainly 4.1).  This results in undefined symbols when
linking static binaries (that is, if you use <code>-static</code>).  If you
see undefined symbols <code>_dlclose</code>, <code>_dlsym</code> or <code>_dlopen</code>
when linking, compile and link against the file
<code>mit/util/misc/dlsym.c</code> from the MIT version of X windows.

<li>The 128-bit long double format that the Sparc port supports currently
works by using the architecturally defined quad-word floating point
instructions.  Since there is no hardware that supports these
instructions they must be emulated by the operating system.  Long
doubles do not work in Sun OS versions 4.0.3 and earlier, because the
kernel emulator uses an obsolete and incompatible format.  Long doubles
do not work in Sun OS version 4.1.1 due to a problem in a Sun library. 
Long doubles do work on Sun OS versions 4.1.2 and higher, but GCC
does not enable them by default.  Long doubles appear to work in Sun OS
5.x (Solaris 2.x).

<li>On HP-UX version 9.01 on the HP PA, the HP compiler <code>cc</code> does not
compile GCC correctly.  We do not yet know why.  However, GCC
compiled on earlier HP-UX versions works properly on HP-UX 9.01 and can
compile itself properly on 9.01.

<li>On the HP PA machine, ADB sometimes fails to work on functions compiled
with GCC.  Specifically, it fails to work on functions that use
<code>alloca</code> or variable-size arrays.  This is because GCC doesn't
generate HP-UX unwind descriptors for such functions.  It may even be
impossible to generate them.

<li>Debugging (<code>-g</code>) is not supported on the HP PA machine, unless you use
the preliminary GNU tools (see <a href="#Installation">Installation</a>).

<li>Taking the address of a label may generate errors from the HP-UX
PA assembler.  GAS for the PA does not have this problem.

<li>Using floating point parameters for indirect calls to static functions
will not work when using the HP assembler.  There simply is no way for GCC
to specify what registers hold arguments for static functions when using
the HP assembler.  GAS for the PA does not have this problem.

<li>In extremely rare cases involving some very large functions you may
receive errors from the HP linker complaining about an out of bounds
unconditional branch offset.  This used to occur more often in previous
versions of GCC, but is now exceptionally rare.  If you should run
into it, you can work around by making your function smaller.

<li>GCC compiled code sometimes emits warnings from the HP-UX assembler of
the form:

<pre>(warning) Use of GR3 when
  frame &gt;= 8192 may cause conflict.
</pre>

<p>These warnings are harmless and can be safely ignored.

</p><li>The current version of the assembler (<code>/bin/as</code>) for the RS/6000
has certain problems that prevent the <code>-g</code> option in GCC from
working.  Note that <code>Makefile.in</code> uses <code>-g</code> by default when
compiling <code>libgcc2.c</code>.

<p>IBM has produced a fixed version of the assembler.  The upgraded
assembler unfortunately was not included in any of the AIX 3.2 update
PTF releases (3.2.2, 3.2.3, or 3.2.3e).  Users of AIX 3.1 should request
PTF U403044 from IBM and users of AIX 3.2 should request PTF U416277. 
See the file <code>README.RS6000</code> for more details on these updates.

<p>You can test for the presense of a fixed assembler by using the
command

<pre>as -u &lt; /dev/null
</pre>

<p>If the command exits normally, the assembler fix already is installed. 
If the assembler complains that "-u" is an unknown flag, you need to
order the fix.

</p><li>On the IBM RS/6000, compiling code of the form

<pre>extern int foo;

<small>...</small> foo <small>...</small>

static int foo;
</pre>

<p>will cause the linker to report an undefined symbol <code>foo</code>. 
Although this behavior differs from most other systems, it is not a
bug because redefining an <code>extern</code> variable as <code>static</code>
is undefined in ANSI C.

</p><li>AIX on the RS/6000 provides support (NLS) for environments outside of
the United States.  Compilers and assemblers use NLS to support
locale-specific representations of various objects including
floating-point numbers ("." vs "," for separating decimal fractions). 
There have been problems reported where the library linked with GCC does
not produce the same floating-point formats that the assembler accepts. 
If you have this problem, set the LANG environment variable to "C" or
"En_US".

<li>Even if you specify <code>-fdollars-in-identifiers</code>,
you cannot successfully use <code>$</code> in identifiers on the RS/6000 due
to a restriction in the IBM assembler.  GAS supports these
identifiers.

<li>On the RS/6000, XLC version 1.3.0.0 will miscompile <code>jump.c</code>.  XLC
version 1.3.0.1 or later fixes this problem.  You can obtain XLC-1.3.0.2
by requesting PTF 421749 from IBM.

<li>There is an assembler bug in versions of DG/UX prior to 5.4.2.01 that
occurs when the <code>fldcr</code> instruction is used.  GCC uses
<code>fldcr</code> on the 88100 to serialize volatile memory references.  Use
the option <code>-mno-serialize-volatile</code> if your version of the
assembler has this bug.

<li>On VMS, GAS versions 1.38.1 and earlier may cause spurious warning
messages from the linker.  These warning messages complain of mismatched
psect attributes.  You can ignore them.  See <a href="#VMS%20Install">VMS Install</a>.

<li>On NewsOS version 3, if you include both of the files <code>stddef.h</code>
and <code>sys/types.h</code>, you get an error because there are two typedefs
of <code>size_t</code>.  You should change <code>sys/types.h</code> by adding these
lines around the definition of <code>size_t</code>:

<pre>#ifndef _SIZE_T
#define _SIZE_T
<var>actual typedef here</var>
#endif
</pre>

<li>On the Alliant, the system's own convention for returning structures
and unions is unusual, and is not compatible with GCC no matter
what options are used.

<li>On the IBM RT PC, the MetaWare HighC compiler (hc) uses a different
convention for structure and union returning.  Use the option
<code>-mhc-struct-return</code> to tell GCC to use a convention compatible
with it.

<li>On Ultrix, the Fortran compiler expects registers 2 through 5 to be saved
by function calls.  However, the C compiler uses conventions compatible
with BSD Unix: registers 2 through 5 may be clobbered by function calls.

<p>GCC uses the same convention as the Ultrix C compiler.  You can use
these options to produce code compatible with the Fortran compiler:

<pre>-fcall-saved-r2 -fcall-saved-r3 -fcall-saved-r4 -fcall-saved-r5
</pre>

</p><li>On the WE32k, you may find that programs compiled with GCC do not
work with the standard shared C library.  You may need to link with
the ordinary C compiler.  If you do so, you must specify the following
options:

<pre>-L/usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/we32k-att-sysv/2.8.1 -lgcc -lc_s
</pre>

<p>The first specifies where to find the library <code>libgcc.a</code>
specified with the <code>-lgcc</code> option.

<p>GCC does linking by invoking <code>ld</code>, just as <code>cc</code> does, and
there is no reason why it <em>should</em> matter which compilation program
you use to invoke <code>ld</code>.  If someone tracks this problem down,
it can probably be fixed easily.

</p><li>On the Alpha, you may get assembler errors about invalid syntax as a
result of floating point constants.  This is due to a bug in the C
library functions <code>ecvt</code>, <code>fcvt</code> and <code>gcvt</code>.  Given valid
floating point numbers, they sometimes print <code>NaN</code>.

<li>On Irix 4.0.5F (and perhaps in some other versions), an assembler bug
sometimes reorders instructions incorrectly when optimization is turned
on.  If you think this may be happening to you, try using the GNU
assembler; GAS version 2.1 supports ECOFF on Irix.

<p>Or use the <code>-noasmopt</code> option when you compile GCC with itself,
and then again when you compile your program.  (This is a temporary
kludge to turn off assembler optimization on Irix.)  If this proves to
be what you need, edit the assembler spec in the file <code>specs</code> so
that it unconditionally passes <code>-O0</code> to the assembler, and never
passes <code>-O2</code> or <code>-O3</code>.

<h2>Problems Compiling Certain Programs</h2>

<p>Certain programs have problems compiling.

<ul>
<li>Parse errors may occur compiling X11 on a Decstation running Ultrix 4.2
because of problems in DEC's versions of the X11 header files
<code>X11/Xlib.h</code> and <code>X11/Xutil.h</code>.  People recommend adding
<code>-I/usr/include/mit</code> to use the MIT versions of the header files,
using the <code>-traditional</code> switch to turn off ANSI C, or fixing the
header files by adding this:

<pre>#ifdef __STDC__
#define NeedFunctionPrototypes 0
#endif
</pre>

<li>If you have trouble compiling Perl on a SunOS 4 system, it may be
because Perl specifies <code>-I/usr/ucbinclude</code>.  This accesses the
unfixed header files.  Perl specifies the options

<pre>-traditional -Dvolatile=__volatile__
-I/usr/include/sun -I/usr/ucbinclude
-fpcc-struct-return
</pre>

<p>most of which are unnecessary with GCC 2.4.5 and newer versions.  You
can make a properly working Perl by setting <code>ccflags</code> to
<code>-fwritable-strings</code> (implied by the <code>-traditional</code> in the
original options) and <code>cppflags</code> to empty in <code>config.sh</code>, then
typing <code>./doSH; make depend; make</code>.

</p><li>On various 386 Unix systems derived from System V, including SCO, ISC,
and ESIX, you may get error messages about running out of virtual memory
while compiling certain programs.

<p>You can prevent this problem by linking GCC with the GNU malloc
(which thus replaces the malloc that comes with the system).  GNU malloc
is available as a separate package, and also in the file
<code>src/gmalloc.c</code> in the GNU Emacs 19 distribution.

<p>If you have installed GNU malloc as a separate library package, use this
option when you relink GCC:

<pre>MALLOC=/usr/local/lib/libgmalloc.a
</pre>

<p>Alternatively, if you have compiled <code>gmalloc.c</code> from Emacs 19, copy
the object file to <code>gmalloc.o</code> and use this option when you relink
GCC:

<pre>MALLOC=gmalloc.o
</pre>
</ul>

<h2>Incompatibilities of GCC</h2>

<p>There are several noteworthy incompatibilities between GNU C and most
existing (non-ANSI) versions of C.  The <code>-traditional</code> option
eliminates many of these incompatibilities, <em>but not all</em>, by
telling GNU C to behave like the other C compilers.

<ul>
<li>GCC normally makes string constants read-only.  If several
identical-looking string constants are used, GCC stores only one
copy of the string.

<p>One consequence is that you cannot call <code>mktemp</code> with a string
constant argument.  The function <code>mktemp</code> always alters the
string its argument points to.

<p>Another consequence is that <code>sscanf</code> does not work on some systems
when passed a string constant as its format control string or input. 
This is because <code>sscanf</code> incorrectly tries to write into the string
constant.  Likewise <code>fscanf</code> and <code>scanf</code>.

<p>The best solution to these problems is to change the program to use
<code>char</code>-array variables with initialization strings for these
purposes instead of string constants.  But if this is not possible,
you can use the <code>-fwritable-strings</code> flag, which directs GCC
to handle string constants the same way most C compilers do. 
<code>-traditional</code> also has this effect, among others.

</p><li><code>-2147483648</code> is positive.

<p>This is because 2147483648 cannot fit in the type <code>int</code>, so
(following the ANSI C rules) its data type is <code>unsigned long int</code>. 
Negating this value yields 2147483648 again.

</p><li>GCC does not substitute macro arguments when they appear inside of
string constants.  For example, the following macro in GCC

<pre>#define foo(a) "a"
</pre>

<p>will produce output <code>"a"</code> regardless of what the argument <var>a</var> is.

<p>The <code>-traditional</code> option directs GCC to handle such cases
(among others) in the old-fashioned (non-ANSI) fashion.

</p><li>When you use <code>setjmp</code> and <code>longjmp</code>, the only automatic
variables guaranteed to remain valid are those declared
<code>volatile</code>.  This is a consequence of automatic register
allocation.  Consider this function:

<pre>jmp_buf j;

foo ()
{
  int a, b;

  a = fun1 ();
  if (setjmp (j))
    return a;

  a = fun2 ();
  /* <code>longjmp (j)</code> may occur in <code>fun3</code>. */
  return a + fun3 ();
}
</pre>

<p>Here <code>a</code> may or may not be restored to its first value when the
<code>longjmp</code> occurs.  If <code>a</code> is allocated in a register, then
its first value is restored; otherwise, it keeps the last value stored
in it.

<p>If you use the <code>-W</code> option with the <code>-O</code> option, you will
get a warning when GCC thinks such a problem might be possible.

<p>The <code>-traditional</code> option directs GNU C to put variables in
the stack by default, rather than in registers, in functions that
call <code>setjmp</code>.  This results in the behavior found in
traditional C compilers.

</p><li>Programs that use preprocessing directives in the middle of macro
arguments do not work with GCC.  For example, a program like this
will not work:

<pre>foobar (
#define luser
        hack)
</pre>

<p>ANSI C does not permit such a construct.  It would make sense to support
it when <code>-traditional</code> is used, but it is too much work to
implement.

</p><li>Declarations of external variables and functions within a block apply
only to the block containing the declaration.  In other words, they
have the same scope as any other declaration in the same place.

<p>In some other C compilers, a <code>extern</code> declaration affects all the
rest of the file even if it happens within a block.

<p>The <code>-traditional</code> option directs GNU C to treat all <code>extern</code>
declarations as global, like traditional compilers.

</p><li>In traditional C, you can combine <code>long</code>, etc., with a typedef name,
as shown here:

<pre>typedef int foo;
typedef long foo bar;
</pre>

<p>In ANSI C, this is not allowed: <code>long</code> and other type modifiers
require an explicit <code>int</code>.  Because this criterion is expressed
by Bison grammar rules rather than C code, the <code>-traditional</code>
flag cannot alter it.

</p><li>PCC allows typedef names to be used as function parameters.  The
difficulty described immediately above applies here too.

<li>PCC allows whitespace in the middle of compound assignment operators
such as <code>+=</code>.  GCC, following the ANSI standard, does not
allow this.  The difficulty described immediately above applies here
too.

<li>GCC complains about unterminated character constants inside of
preprocessing conditionals that fail.  Some programs have English
comments enclosed in conditionals that are guaranteed to fail; if these
comments contain apostrophes, GCC will probably report an error.  For
example, this code would produce an error:

<pre>#if 0
You can't expect this to work.
#endif
</pre>

<p>The best solution to such a problem is to put the text into an actual
C comment delimited by <code>/*<small>...</small>*/</code>.  However,
<code>-traditional</code> suppresses these error messages.

</p><li>Many user programs contain the declaration <code>long time ();</code>.  In the
past, the system header files on many systems did not actually declare
<code>time</code>, so it did not matter what type your program declared it to
return.  But in systems with ANSI C headers, <code>time</code> is declared to
return <code>time_t</code>, and if that is not the same as <code>long</code>, then
<code>long time ();</code> is erroneous.

<p>The solution is to change your program to use <code>time_t</code> as the return
type of <code>time</code>.

</p><li>When compiling functions that return <code>float</code>, PCC converts it to
a double.  GCC actually returns a <code>float</code>.  If you are concerned
with PCC compatibility, you should declare your functions to return
<code>double</code>; you might as well say what you mean.

<li>When compiling functions that return structures or unions, GCC
output code normally uses a method different from that used on most
versions of Unix.  As a result, code compiled with GCC cannot call
a structure-returning function compiled with PCC, and vice versa.

<p>The method used by GCC is as follows: a structure or union which is
1, 2, 4 or 8 bytes long is returned like a scalar.  A structure or union
with any other size is stored into an address supplied by the caller
(usually in a special, fixed register, but on some machines it is passed
on the stack).  The machine-description macros <code>STRUCT_VALUE</code> and
<code>STRUCT_INCOMING_VALUE</code> tell GCC where to pass this address.

<p>By contrast, PCC on most target machines returns structures and unions
of any size by copying the data into an area of static storage, and then
returning the address of that storage as if it were a pointer value. 
The caller must copy the data from that memory area to the place where
the value is wanted.  GCC does not use this method because it is
slower and nonreentrant.

<p>On some newer machines, PCC uses a reentrant convention for all
structure and union returning.  GCC on most of these machines uses a
compatible convention when returning structures and unions in memory,
but still returns small structures and unions in registers.

<p>You can tell GCC to use a compatible convention for all structure and
union returning with the option <code>-fpcc-struct-return</code>.

</p><li>GNU C complains about program fragments such as <code>0x74ae-0x4000</code>
which appear to be two hexadecimal constants separated by the minus
operator.  Actually, this string is a single <dfn>preprocessing token</dfn>. 
Each such token must correspond to one token in C.  Since this does not,
GNU C prints an error message.  Although it may appear obvious that what
is meant is an operator and two values, the ANSI C standard specifically
requires that this be treated as erroneous.

<p>A <dfn>preprocessing token</dfn> is a <dfn>preprocessing number</dfn> if it
begins with a digit and is followed by letters, underscores, digits,
periods and <code>e+</code>, <code>e-</code>, <code>E+</code>, or <code>E-</code> character
sequences.

<p>To make the above program fragment valid, place whitespace in front of
the minus sign.  This whitespace will end the preprocessing number.

<h2>Fixed Header Files</h2>

<p>GCC needs to install corrected versions of some system header files. 
This is because most target systems have some header files that won't
work with GCC unless they are changed.  Some have bugs, some are
incompatible with ANSI C, and some depend on special features of other
compilers.

<p>Installing GCC automatically creates and installs the fixed header
files, by running a program called <code>fixincludes</code> (or for certain
targets an alternative such as <code>fixinc.svr4</code>).  Normally, you
don't need to pay attention to this.  But there are cases where it
doesn't do the right thing automatically.

<ul>
<li>If you update the system's header files, such as by installing a new
system version, the fixed header files of GCC are not automatically
updated.  The easiest way to update them is to reinstall GCC.  (If
you want to be clever, look in the makefile and you can find a
shortcut.)

<li>On some systems, in particular SunOS 4, header file directories contain
machine-specific symbolic links in certain places.  This makes it
possible to share most of the header files among hosts running the
same version of SunOS 4 on different machine models.

<p>The programs that fix the header files do not understand this special
way of using symbolic links; therefore, the directory of fixed header
files is good only for the machine model used to build it.

<p>In SunOS 4, only programs that look inside the kernel will notice the
difference between machine models.  Therefore, for most purposes, you
need not be concerned about this.

<p>It is possible to make separate sets of fixed header files for the
different machine models, and arrange a structure of symbolic links so
as to use the proper set, but you'll have to do this by hand.

</p><li>On Lynxos, GCC by default does not fix the header files.  This is
because bugs in the shell cause the <code>fixincludes</code> script to fail.

<p>This means you will encounter problems due to bugs in the system header
files.  It may be no comfort that they aren't GCC's fault, but it
does mean that there's nothing for us to do about them.

<h2>Standard Libraries</h2>

<p>GCC by itself attempts to be what the ISO/ANSI C standard calls a
<dfn>conforming freestanding implementation</dfn>.  This means all ANSI
C language features are available, as well as the contents of
<code>float.h</code>, <code>limits.h</code>, <code>stdarg.h</code>, and
<code>stddef.h</code>.  The rest of the C library is supplied by the
vendor of the operating system.  If that C library doesn't conform to
the C standards, then your programs might get warnings (especially when
using <code>-Wall</code>) that you don't expect.

<p>For example, the <code>sprintf</code> function on SunOS 4.1.3 returns
<code>char *</code> while the C standard says that <code>sprintf</code> returns an
<code>int</code>.  The <code>fixincludes</code> program could make the prototype for
this function match the Standard, but that would be wrong, since the
function will still return <code>char *</code>.

<p>If you need a Standard compliant library, then you need to find one, as
GCC does not provide one.  The GNU C library (called <code>glibc</code>)
has been ported to a number of operating systems, and provides ANSI/ISO,
POSIX, BSD and SystemV compatibility.  You could also ask your operating
system vendor if newer libraries are available.

<h2>Disappointments and Misunderstandings</h2>

<p>These problems are perhaps regrettable, but we don't know any practical
way around them.

<ul>
<li>Certain local variables aren't recognized by debuggers when you compile
with optimization.

<p>This occurs because sometimes GCC optimizes the variable out of
existence.  There is no way to tell the debugger how to compute the
value such a variable "would have had", and it is not clear that would
be desirable anyway.  So GCC simply does not mention the eliminated
variable when it writes debugging information.

<p>You have to expect a certain amount of disagreement between the
executable and your source code, when you use optimization.

</p><li>Users often think it is a bug when GCC reports an error for code
like this:

<pre>int foo (struct mumble *);

struct mumble { <small>...</small> };

int foo (struct mumble *x)
{ <small>...</small> }
</pre>

<p>This code really is erroneous, because the scope of <code>struct
mumble</code> in the prototype is limited to the argument list containing it. 
It does not refer to the <code>struct mumble</code> defined with file scope
immediately below--they are two unrelated types with similar names in
different scopes.

<p>But in the definition of <code>foo</code>, the file-scope type is used
because that is available to be inherited.  Thus, the definition and
the prototype do not match, and you get an error.

<p>This behavior may seem silly, but it's what the ANSI standard specifies. 
It is easy enough for you to make your code work by moving the
definition of <code>struct mumble</code> above the prototype.  It's not worth
being incompatible with ANSI C just to avoid an error for the example
shown above.

</p><li>Accesses to bitfields even in volatile objects works by accessing larger
objects, such as a byte or a word.  You cannot rely on what size of
object is accessed in order to read or write the bitfield; it may even
vary for a given bitfield according to the precise usage.

<p>If you care about controlling the amount of memory that is accessed, use
volatile but do not use bitfields.

</p><li>GCC comes with shell scripts to fix certain known problems in system
header files.  They install corrected copies of various header files in
a special directory where only GCC will normally look for them.  The
scripts adapt to various systems by searching all the system header
files for the problem cases that we know about.

<p>If new system header files are installed, nothing automatically arranges
to update the corrected header files.  You will have to reinstall GCC
to fix the new header files.  More specifically, go to the build
directory and delete the files <code>stmp-fixinc</code> and
<code>stmp-headers</code>, and the subdirectory <code>include</code>; then do
<code>make install</code> again.

</p><li>On 68000 and x86 systems, for instance, you can get paradoxical results
if you test the precise values of floating point numbers.  For example,
you can find that a floating point value which is not a NaN is not equal
to itself.  This results from the fact that the floating point registers
hold a few more bits of precision than fit in a <code>double</code> in memory. 
Compiled code moves values between memory and floating point registers
at its convenience, and moving them into memory truncates them.

<p>You can partially avoid this problem by using the <code>-ffloat-store</code>
option (see <a href="#Optimize%20Options">Optimize Options</a>).

</p><li>On the MIPS, variable argument functions using <code>varargs.h</code>
cannot have a floating point value for the first argument.  The
reason for this is that in the absence of a prototype in scope,
if the first argument is a floating point, it is passed in a
floating point register, rather than an integer register.

<p>If the code is rewritten to use the ANSI standard <code>stdarg.h</code>
method of variable arguments, and the prototype is in scope at
the time of the call, everything will work fine.

</p><li>On the H8/300 and H8/300H, variable argument functions must be
implemented using the ANSI standard <code>stdarg.h</code> method of
variable arguments.  Furthermore, calls to functions using <code>stdarg.h</code>
variable arguments must have a prototype for the called function
in scope at the time of the call.

<h2>Common Misunderstandings with GNU C++</h2>

<p>C++ is a complex language and an evolving one, and its standard
definition (the ISO C++ standard) was only recently completed.  As a
result, your C++ compiler may occasionally surprise you, even when its
behavior is correct.  This section discusses some areas that frequently
give rise to questions of this sort.

<ul>
<li><a href="#Static%20Definitions">Static Definitions</a>:   Static member declarations are not definitions
<li><a href="#Temporaries">Temporaries</a>:          Temporaries may vanish before you expect
<li><a href="#Copy%20Assignment">Copy Assignment</a>:      Copy Assignment operators copy virtual bases twice
</ul>

<br>

<h3>Declare <em>and</em> Define Static Members</h3>

<p>When a class has static data members, it is not enough to <em>declare</em>
the static member; you must also <em>define</em> it.  For example:

<pre>class Foo
{
  <small>...</small>
  void method();
  static int bar;
};
</pre>

<p>This declaration only establishes that the class <code>Foo</code> has an
<code>int</code> named <code>Foo::bar</code>, and a member function named
<code>Foo::method</code>.  But you still need to define <em>both</em>
<code>method</code> and <code>bar</code> elsewhere.  According to the draft ANSI
standard, you must supply an initializer in one (and only one) source
file, such as:

<pre>int Foo::bar = 0;
</pre>

<p>Other C++ compilers may not correctly implement the standard behavior. 
As a result, when you switch to <code>g++</code> from one of these compilers,
you may discover that a program that appeared to work correctly in fact
does not conform to the standard: <code>g++</code> reports as undefined
symbols any static data members that lack definitions.

<br>

<h3>Temporaries May Vanish Before You Expect</h3>

<p>It is dangerous to use pointers or references to <em>portions</em> of a
temporary object.  The compiler may very well delete the object before
you expect it to, leaving a pointer to garbage.  The most common place
where this problem crops up is in classes like string classes,
especially ones that define a conversion function to type <code>char *</code>
or <code>const char *</code> - which is one reason why the standard
<code>string</code> class requires you to call the <code>c_str</code> member
function.  However, any class that returns a pointer to some internal
structure is potentially subject to this problem.

<p>For example, a program may use a function <code>strfunc</code> that returns
<code>string</code> objects, and another function <code>charfunc</code> that
operates on pointers to <code>char</code>:

<pre>string strfunc ();
void charfunc (const char *);

void
f ()
{
  const char *p = strfunc().c_str();
  ...
  charfunc (p);
  ...
  charfunc (p);
}
</pre>

<p>In this situation, it may seem reasonable to save a pointer to the C
string returned by the <code>c_str</code> member function and use that rather
than call <code>c_str</code> repeatedly.  However, the temporary string
created by the call to <code>strfunc</code> is destroyed after <code>p</code> is
initialized, at which point <code>p</code> is left pointing to freed memory.

<p>Code like this may run successfully under some other compilers,
particularly obsolete cfront-based compilers that delete temporaries
along with normal local variables.  However, the GNU C++ behavior is
standard-conforming, so if your program depends on late destruction of
temporaries it is not portable.

<p>The safe way to write such code is to give the temporary a name, which
forces it to remain until the end of the scope of the name.  For
example:

<pre>string&amp; tmp = strfunc ();
charfunc (tmp.c_str ());
</pre>

<h3>Implicit Copy-Assignment for Virtual Bases</h3>

<p>When a base class is virtual, only one subobject of the base class
belongs to each full object. Also, the constructors and destructors are
invoked only once, and called from the most-derived class. However, such
objects behave unspecified when being assigned. For example:

<pre>struct Base{
  char *name;
  Base(char *n) : name(strdup(n)){}
  Base&amp; operator= (const Base&amp; other){
   free (name);
   name = strdup (other.name);
  }
};

struct A:virtual Base{
  int val;
  A():Base("A"){}
};

struct B:virtual Base{
  int bval;
  B():Base("B"){}
};

struct Derived:public A, public B{
  Derived():Base("Derived"){}
};

void func(Derived &amp;d1, Derived &amp;d2)
{
  d1 = d2;
}
</pre>

<p>The C++ standard specifies that <code>Base::Base</code> is only called once
when constructing or copy-constructing a Derived object. It is
unspecified whether <code>Base::operator=</code> is called more than once when
the implicit copy-assignment for Derived objects is invoked (as it is
inside <code>func</code> in the example).

<p>g++ implements the "intuitive" algorithm for copy-assignment: assign all
direct bases, then assign all members. In that algorithm, the virtual
base subobject can be encountered many times. In the example, copying
proceeds in the following order: <code>val</code>, <code>name</code> (via
<code>strdup</code>), <code>bval</code>, and <code>name</code> again.

<p>If application code relies on copy-assignment, a user-defined
copy-assignment operator removes any uncertainties. With such an
operator, the application can define whether and how the virtual base
subobject is assigned.

<h2>Caveats of using <code>protoize</code></h2>

<p>The conversion programs <code>protoize</code> and <code>unprotoize</code> can
sometimes change a source file in a way that won't work unless you
rearrange it.

<ul>
<li><code>protoize</code> can insert references to a type name or type tag before
the definition, or in a file where they are not defined.

<p>If this happens, compiler error messages should show you where the new
references are, so fixing the file by hand is straightforward.

</p><li>There are some C constructs which <code>protoize</code> cannot figure out. 
For example, it can't determine argument types for declaring a
pointer-to-function variable; this you must do by hand.  <code>protoize</code>
inserts a comment containing <code>???</code> each time it finds such a
variable; so you can find all such variables by searching for this
string.  ANSI C does not require declaring the argument types of
pointer-to-function types.

<li>Using <code>unprotoize</code> can easily introduce bugs.  If the program
relied on prototypes to bring about conversion of arguments, these
conversions will not take place in the program without prototypes. 
One case in which you can be sure <code>unprotoize</code> is safe is when
you are removing prototypes that were made with <code>protoize</code>; if
the program worked before without any prototypes, it will work again
without them.

<p>You can find all the places where this problem might occur by compiling
the program with the <code>-Wconversion</code> option.  It prints a warning
whenever an argument is converted.

</p><li>Both conversion programs can be confused if there are macro calls in and
around the text to be converted.  In other words, the standard syntax
for a declaration or definition must not result from expanding a macro. 
This problem is inherent in the design of C and cannot be fixed.  If
only a few functions have confusing macro calls, you can easily convert
them manually.

<li><code>protoize</code> cannot get the argument types for a function whose
definition was not actually compiled due to preprocessing conditionals. 
When this happens, <code>protoize</code> changes nothing in regard to such
a function.  <code>protoize</code> tries to detect such instances and warn
about them.

<p>You can generally work around this problem by using <code>protoize</code> step
by step, each time specifying a different set of <code>-D</code> options for
compilation, until all of the functions have been converted.  There is
no automatic way to verify that you have got them all, however.

</p><li>Confusion may result if there is an occasion to convert a function
declaration or definition in a region of source code where there is more
than one formal parameter list present.  Thus, attempts to convert code
containing multiple (conditionally compiled) versions of a single
function header (in the same vicinity) may not produce the desired (or
expected) results.

<p>If you plan on converting source files which contain such code, it is
recommended that you first make sure that each conditionally compiled
region of source code which contains an alternative function header also
contains at least one additional follower token (past the final right
parenthesis of the function header).  This should circumvent the
problem.

</p><li><code>unprotoize</code> can become confused when trying to convert a function
definition or declaration which contains a declaration for a
pointer-to-function formal argument which has the same name as the
function being defined or declared.  We recommand you avoid such choices
of formal parameter names.

<li>You might also want to correct some of the indentation by hand and break
long lines.  (The conversion programs don't write lines longer than
eighty characters in any case.)

<h2>Certain Changes We Don't Want to Make</h2>

<p>This section lists changes that people frequently request, but which
we do not make because we think GCC is better without them.

<ul>
<li>Checking the number and type of arguments to a function which has an
old-fashioned definition and no prototype.

<p>Such a feature would work only occasionally--only for calls that appear
in the same file as the called function, following the definition.  The
only way to check all calls reliably is to add a prototype for the
function.  But adding a prototype eliminates the motivation for this
feature.  So the feature is not worthwhile.

</p><li>Warning about using an expression whose type is signed as a shift count.

<p>Shift count operands are probably signed more often than unsigned. 
Warning about this would cause far more annoyance than good.

</p><li>Warning about assigning a signed value to an unsigned variable.

<p>Such assignments must be very common; warning about them would cause
more annoyance than good.

</p><li>Warning about unreachable code.

<p>It's very common to have unreachable code in machine-generated
programs.  For example, this happens normally in some files of GNU C
itself.

</p><li>Warning when a non-void function value is ignored.

<p>Coming as I do from a Lisp background, I balk at the idea that there is
something dangerous about discarding a value.  There are functions that
return values which some callers may find useful; it makes no sense to
clutter the program with a cast to <code>void</code> whenever the value isn't
useful.

</p><li>Assuming (for optimization) that the address of an external symbol is
never zero.

<p>This assumption is false on certain systems when <code>#pragma weak</code> is
used.

</p><li>Making <code>-fshort-enums</code> the default.

<p>This would cause storage layout to be incompatible with most other C
compilers.  And it doesn't seem very important, given that you can get
the same result in other ways.  The case where it matters most is when
the enumeration-valued object is inside a structure, and in that case
you can specify a field width explicitly.

</p><li>Making bitfields unsigned by default on particular machines where "the
ABI standard" says to do so.

<p>The ANSI C standard leaves it up to the implementation whether a bitfield
declared plain <code>int</code> is signed or not.  This in effect creates two
alternative dialects of C.

<p>The GNU C compiler supports both dialects; you can specify the signed
dialect with <code>-fsigned-bitfields</code> and the unsigned dialect with
<code>-funsigned-bitfields</code>.  However, this leaves open the question of
which dialect to use by default.

<p>Currently, the preferred dialect makes plain bitfields signed, because
this is simplest.  Since <code>int</code> is the same as <code>signed int</code> in
every other context, it is cleanest for them to be the same in bitfields
as well.

<p>Some computer manufacturers have published Application Binary Interface
standards which specify that plain bitfields should be unsigned.  It is
a mistake, however, to say anything about this issue in an ABI.  This is
because the handling of plain bitfields distinguishes two dialects of C. 
Both dialects are meaningful on every type of machine.  Whether a
particular object file was compiled using signed bitfields or unsigned
is of no concern to other object files, even if they access the same
bitfields in the same data structures.

<p>A given program is written in one or the other of these two dialects. 
The program stands a chance to work on most any machine if it is
compiled with the proper dialect.  It is unlikely to work at all if
compiled with the wrong dialect.

<p>Many users appreciate the GNU C compiler because it provides an
environment that is uniform across machines.  These users would be
inconvenienced if the compiler treated plain bitfields differently on
certain machines.

<p>Occasionally users write programs intended only for a particular machine
type.  On these occasions, the users would benefit if the GNU C compiler
were to support by default the same dialect as the other compilers on
that machine.  But such applications are rare.  And users writing a
program to run on more than one type of machine cannot possibly benefit
from this kind of compatibility.

<p>This is why GCC does and will treat plain bitfields in the same
fashion on all types of machines (by default).

<p>There are some arguments for making bitfields unsigned by default on all
machines.  If, for example, this becomes a universal de facto standard,
it would make sense for GCC to go along with it.  This is something
to be considered in the future.

<p>(Of course, users strongly concerned about portability should indicate
explicitly in each bitfield whether it is signed or not.  In this way,
they write programs which have the same meaning in both C dialects.)

</p><li>Undefining <code>__STDC__</code> when <code>-ansi</code> is not used.

<p>Currently, GCC defines <code>__STDC__</code> as long as you don't use
<code>-traditional</code>.  This provides good results in practice.

<p>Programmers normally use conditionals on <code>__STDC__</code> to ask whether
it is safe to use certain features of ANSI C, such as function
prototypes or ANSI token concatenation.  Since plain <code>gcc</code> supports
all the features of ANSI C, the correct answer to these questions is
"yes".

<p>Some users try to use <code>__STDC__</code> to check for the availability of
certain library facilities.  This is actually incorrect usage in an ANSI
C program, because the ANSI C standard says that a conforming
freestanding implementation should define <code>__STDC__</code> even though it
does not have the library facilities.  <code>gcc -ansi -pedantic</code> is a
conforming freestanding implementation, and it is therefore required to
define <code>__STDC__</code>, even though it does not come with an ANSI C
library.

<p>Sometimes people say that defining <code>__STDC__</code> in a compiler that
does not completely conform to the ANSI C standard somehow violates the
standard.  This is illogical.  The standard is a standard for compilers
that claim to support ANSI C, such as <code>gcc -ansi</code>--not for other
compilers such as plain <code>gcc</code>.  Whatever the ANSI C standard says
is relevant to the design of plain <code>gcc</code> without <code>-ansi</code> only
for pragmatic reasons, not as a requirement.

<p>GCC normally defines <code>__STDC__</code> to be 1, and in addition
defines <code>__STRICT_ANSI__</code> if you specify the <code>-ansi</code> option. 
On some hosts, system include files use a different convention, where
<code>__STDC__</code> is normally 0, but is 1 if the user specifies strict
conformance to the C Standard.  GCC follows the host convention when
processing system include files, but when processing user files it follows
the usual GNU C convention.

</p><li>Undefining <code>__STDC__</code> in C++.

<p>Programs written to compile with C++-to-C translators get the
value of <code>__STDC__</code> that goes with the C compiler that is
subsequently used.  These programs must test <code>__STDC__</code>
to determine what kind of C preprocessor that compiler uses:
whether they should concatenate tokens in the ANSI C fashion
or in the traditional fashion.

<p>These programs work properly with GNU C++ if <code>__STDC__</code> is defined. 
They would not work otherwise.

<p>In addition, many header files are written to provide prototypes in ANSI
C but not in traditional C.  Many of these header files can work without
change in C++ provided <code>__STDC__</code> is defined.  If <code>__STDC__</code>
is not defined, they will all fail, and will all need to be changed to
test explicitly for C++ as well.

</p><li>Deleting "empty" loops.

<p>Historically, GCC has not deleted "empty" loops under the
assumption that the most likely reason you would put one in a program is
to have a delay, so deleting them will not make real programs run any
faster.

<p>However, the rationale here is that optimization of a nonempty loop
cannot produce an empty one, which holds for C but is not always the
case for C++.

<p>Moreover, with <code>-funroll-loops</code> small "empty" loops are already
removed, so the current behavior is both sub-optimal and inconsistent
and will change in the future.

</p><li>Making side effects happen in the same order as in some other compiler.

<p>It is never safe to depend on the order of evaluation of side effects. 
For example, a function call like this may very well behave differently
from one compiler to another:

<pre>void func (int, int);

int i = 2;
func (i++, i++);
</pre>

<p>There is no guarantee (in either the C or the C++ standard language
definitions) that the increments will be evaluated in any particular
order.  Either increment might happen first.  <code>func</code> might get the
arguments <code>2, 3</code>, or it might get <code>3, 2</code>, or even <code>2, 2</code>.

</p><li>Not allowing structures with volatile fields in registers.

<p>Strictly speaking, there is no prohibition in the ANSI C standard
against allowing structures with volatile fields in registers, but
it does not seem to make any sense and is probably not what you wanted
to do.  So the compiler will give an error message in this case.

<h2>Warning Messages and Error Messages</h2>

<p>The GNU compiler can produce two kinds of diagnostics: errors and
warnings.  Each kind has a different purpose:

<ul>
<li><em>Errors</em> report problems that make it impossible to compile your
program.  GCC reports errors with the source file name and line
number where the problem is apparent.

<li><em>Warnings</em> report other unusual conditions in your code that
<em>may</em> indicate a problem, although compilation can (and does)
proceed.  Warning messages also report the source file name and line
number, but include the text <code>warning:</code> to distinguish them
from error messages. 
</ul>

<p>Warnings may indicate danger points where you should check to make sure
that your program really does what you intend; or the use of obsolete
features; or the use of nonstandard features of GNU C or C++.  Many
warnings are issued only if you ask for them, with one of the <code>-W</code>
options (for instance, <code>-Wall</code> requests a variety of useful
warnings).

<p>GCC always tries to compile your program if possible; it never
gratuitously rejects a program whose meaning is clear merely because
(for instance) it fails to conform to a standard.  In some cases,
however, the C and C++ standards specify that certain extensions are
forbidden, and a diagnostic <em>must</em> be issued by a conforming
compiler.  The <code>-pedantic</code> option tells GCC to issue warnings in
such cases; <code>-pedantic-errors</code> says to make them errors instead. 
This does not mean that <em>all</em> non-ANSI constructs get warnings
or errors.

<p>See <a href="#Warning%20Options">Options to Request or Suppress Warnings</a>, for
more detail on these and related command-line options.

<h1>Reporting Bugs</h1>

<p>Your bug reports play an essential role in making GCC reliable.

<p>When you encounter a problem, the first thing to do is to see if it is
already known.  See <a href="#Trouble">Trouble</a>.  If it isn't known, then you should
report the problem.

<p>Reporting a bug may help you by bringing a solution to your problem, or
it may not.  (If it does not, look in the service directory; see
<a href="#Service">Service</a>.)  In any case, the principal function of a bug report is
to help the entire community by making the next version of GCC work
better.  Bug reports are your contribution to the maintenance of GCC.

<p>Since the maintainers are very overloaded, we cannot respond to every
bug report.  However, if the bug has not been fixed, we are likely to
send you a patch and ask you to tell us whether it works.

<p>In order for a bug report to serve its purpose, you must include the
information that makes for fixing the bug.

<h2>Have You Found a Bug?</h2>

<p>If you are not sure whether you have found a bug, here are some guidelines:

<ul>
<li>If the compiler gets a fatal signal, for any input whatever, that is a
compiler bug.  Reliable compilers never crash.

<li>If the compiler produces invalid assembly code, for any input whatever
(except an <code>asm</code> statement), that is a compiler bug, unless the
compiler reports errors (not just warnings) which would ordinarily
prevent the assembler from being run.

<li>If the compiler produces valid assembly code that does not correctly
execute the input source code, that is a compiler bug.

<p>However, you must double-check to make sure, because you may have run
into an incompatibility between GNU C and traditional C
(see <a href="#Incompatibilities">Incompatibilities</a>).  These incompatibilities might be considered
bugs, but they are inescapable consequences of valuable features.

<p>Or you may have a program whose behavior is undefined, which happened
by chance to give the desired results with another C or C++ compiler.

<p>For example, in many nonoptimizing compilers, you can write <code>x;</code>
at the end of a function instead of <code>return x;</code>, with the same
results.  But the value of the function is undefined if <code>return</code>
is omitted; it is not a bug when GCC produces different results.

<p>Problems often result from expressions with two increment operators,
as in <code>f (*p++, *p++)</code>.  Your previous compiler might have
interpreted that expression the way you intended; GCC might
interpret it another way.  Neither compiler is wrong.  The bug is
in your code.

<p>After you have localized the error to a single source line, it should
be easy to check for these things.  If your program is correct and
well defined, you have found a compiler bug.

</p><li>If the compiler produces an error message for valid input, that is a
compiler bug.

<li>If the compiler does not produce an error message for invalid input,
that is a compiler bug.  However, you should note that your idea of
"invalid input" might be my idea of "an extension" or "support
for traditional practice".

<li>If you are an experienced user of C or C++ (or Fortran or Objective-C)
compilers, your suggestions
for improvement of GCC are welcome in any case.

<h2>Where to Report Bugs</h2>

<p>Send bug reports for the GNU Compiler Collection to
<code>gcc-bugs@gcc.gnu.org</code>.  In accordance with the GNU-wide
convention, in which bug reports for tool "foo" are sent
to <code>bug-foo@gnu.org</code>, the address <code>bug-gcc@gnu.org</code>
may also be used; it will forward to the address given above.

<p>Please read <code>&lt;URL:http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/bugs.html&gt;</code> for
bug reporting instructions before you post a bug report.

<p>Often people think of posting bug reports to the newsgroup instead of
mailing them.  This appears to work, but it has one problem which can be
crucial: a newsgroup posting does not contain a mail path back to the
sender.  Thus, if maintainers need more information, they may be unable
to reach you.  For this reason, you should always send bug reports by
mail to the proper mailing list.

<p>As a last resort, send bug reports on paper to:

<h2>How to Report Bugs</h2>

<p>You may find additional and/or more up-to-date instructions at
<code>&lt;URL:http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/bugs.html&gt;</code>.

<p>The fundamental principle of reporting bugs usefully is this:
<strong>report all the facts</strong>.  If you are not sure whether to state a
fact or leave it out, state it!

<p>Often people omit facts because they think they know what causes the
problem and they conclude that some details don't matter.  Thus, you might
assume that the name of the variable you use in an example does not matter. 
Well, probably it doesn't, but one cannot be sure.  Perhaps the bug is a
stray memory reference which happens to fetch from the location where that
name is stored in memory; perhaps, if the name were different, the contents
of that location would fool the compiler into doing the right thing despite
the bug.  Play it safe and give a specific, complete example.  That is the
easiest thing for you to do, and the most helpful.

<p>Keep in mind that the purpose of a bug report is to enable someone to
fix the bug if it is not known.  It isn't very important what happens if
the bug is already known.  Therefore, always write your bug reports on
the assumption that the bug is not known.

<p>Sometimes people give a few sketchy facts and ask, "Does this ring a
bell?"  This cannot help us fix a bug, so it is basically useless.  We
respond by asking for enough details to enable us to investigate. 
You might as well expedite matters by sending them to begin with.

<p>Try to make your bug report self-contained.  If we have to ask you for
more information, it is best if you include all the previous information
in your response, as well as the information that was missing.

<p>Please report each bug in a separate message.  This makes it easier for
us to track which bugs have been fixed and to forward your bugs reports
to the appropriate maintainer.

<p>To enable someone to investigate the bug, you should include all these
things:

<ul>
<li>The version of GCC.  You can get this by running it with the
<code>-v</code> option.

<p>Without this, we won't know whether there is any point in looking for
the bug in the current version of GCC.

</p><li>A complete input file that will reproduce the bug.  If the bug is in the
C preprocessor, send a source file and any header files that it
requires.  If the bug is in the compiler proper (<code>cc1</code>), send the
preprocessor output generated by adding <code>-save-temps</code> to the
compilation command (see <a href="#Debugging%20Options">Debugging Options</a>).  When you do this, use
the same <code>-I</code>, <code>-D</code> or <code>-U</code> options that you used in
actual compilation. Then send the <var>input</var>.i or <var>input</var>.ii files
generated.

<p>A single statement is not enough of an example.  In order to compile it,
it must be embedded in a complete file of compiler input; and the bug
might depend on the details of how this is done.

<p>Without a real example one can compile, all anyone can do about your bug
report is wish you luck.  It would be futile to try to guess how to
provoke the bug.  For example, bugs in register allocation and reloading
frequently depend on every little detail of the function they happen in.

<p>Even if the input file that fails comes from a GNU program, you should
still send the complete test case.  Don't ask the GCC maintainers to
do the extra work of obtaining the program in question--they are all
overworked as it is.  Also, the problem may depend on what is in the
header files on your system; it is unreliable for the GCC maintainers
to try the problem with the header files available to them.  By sending
CPP output, you can eliminate this source of uncertainty and save us
a certain percentage of wild goose chases.

</p><li>The command arguments you gave GCC to compile that example
and observe the bug.  For example, did you use <code>-O</code>?  To guarantee
you won't omit something important, list all the options.

<p>If we were to try to guess the arguments, we would probably guess wrong
and then we would not encounter the bug.

</p><li>The type of machine you are using, and the operating system name and
version number.

<li>The operands you gave to the <code>configure</code> command when you installed
the compiler.

<li>A complete list of any modifications you have made to the compiler
source.  (We don't promise to investigate the bug unless it happens in
an unmodified compiler.  But if you've made modifications and don't tell
us, then you are sending us on a wild goose chase.)

<p>Be precise about these changes.  A description in English is not
enough--send a context diff for them.

<p>Adding files of your own (such as a machine description for a machine we
don't support) is a modification of the compiler source.

</p><li>Details of any other deviations from the standard procedure for installing
GCC.

<li>A description of what behavior you observe that you believe is
incorrect.  For example, "The compiler gets a fatal signal," or,
"The assembler instruction at line 208 in the output is incorrect."

<p>Of course, if the bug is that the compiler gets a fatal signal, then one
can't miss it.  But if the bug is incorrect output, the maintainer might
not notice unless it is glaringly wrong.  None of us has time to study
all the assembler code from a 50-line C program just on the chance that
one instruction might be wrong.  We need <em>you</em> to do this part!

<p>Even if the problem you experience is a fatal signal, you should still
say so explicitly.  Suppose something strange is going on, such as, your
copy of the compiler is out of synch, or you have encountered a bug in
the C library on your system.  (This has happened!)  Your copy might
crash and the copy here would not.  If you <i>said</i> to expect a crash,
then when the compiler here fails to crash, we would know that the bug
was not happening.  If you don't say to expect a crash, then we would
not know whether the bug was happening.  We would not be able to draw
any conclusion from our observations.

<p>If the problem is a diagnostic when compiling GCC with some other
compiler, say whether it is a warning or an error.

<p>Often the observed symptom is incorrect output when your program is run. 
Sad to say, this is not enough information unless the program is short
and simple.  None of us has time to study a large program to figure out
how it would work if compiled correctly, much less which line of it was
compiled wrong.  So you will have to do that.  Tell us which source line
it is, and what incorrect result happens when that line is executed.  A
person who understands the program can find this as easily as finding a
bug in the program itself.

</p><li>If you send examples of assembler code output from GCC,
please use <code>-g</code> when you make them.  The debugging information
includes source line numbers which are essential for correlating the
output with the input.

<li>If you wish to mention something in the GCC source, refer to it by
context, not by line number.

<p>The line numbers in the development sources don't match those in your
sources.  Your line numbers would convey no useful information to the
maintainers.

</p><li>Additional information from a debugger might enable someone to find a
problem on a machine which he does not have available.  However, you
need to think when you collect this information if you want it to have
any chance of being useful.

<p>For example, many people send just a backtrace, but that is never
useful by itself.  A simple backtrace with arguments conveys little
about GCC because the compiler is largely data-driven; the same
functions are called over and over for different RTL insns, doing
different things depending on the details of the insn.

<p>Most of the arguments listed in the backtrace are useless because they
are pointers to RTL list structure.  The numeric values of the
pointers, which the debugger prints in the backtrace, have no
significance whatever; all that matters is the contents of the objects
they point to (and most of the contents are other such pointers).

<p>In addition, most compiler passes consist of one or more loops that
scan the RTL insn sequence.  The most vital piece of information about
such a loop--which insn it has reached--is usually in a local variable,
not in an argument.

<p>What you need to provide in addition to a backtrace are the values of
the local variables for several stack frames up.  When a local
variable or an argument is an RTX, first print its value and then use
the GDB command <code>pr</code> to print the RTL expression that it points
to.  (If GDB doesn't run on your machine, use your debugger to call
the function <code>debug_rtx</code> with the RTX as an argument.)  In
general, whenever a variable is a pointer, its value is no use
without the data it points to. 
</ul>

<p>Here are some things that are not necessary:

<ul>
<li>A description of the envelope of the bug.

<p>Often people who encounter a bug spend a lot of time investigating
which changes to the input file will make the bug go away and which
changes will not affect it.

<p>This is often time consuming and not very useful, because the way we
will find the bug is by running a single example under the debugger with
breakpoints, not by pure deduction from a series of examples.  You might
as well save your time for something else.

<p>Of course, if you can find a simpler example to report <em>instead</em> of
the original one, that is a convenience.  Errors in the output will be
easier to spot, running under the debugger will take less time, etc. 
Most GCC bugs involve just one function, so the most straightforward
way to simplify an example is to delete all the function definitions
except the one where the bug occurs.  Those earlier in the file may be
replaced by external declarations if the crucial function depends on
them.  (Exception: inline functions may affect compilation of functions
defined later in the file.)

<p>However, simplification is not vital; if you don't want to do this,
report the bug anyway and send the entire test case you used.

</p><li>In particular, some people insert conditionals <code>#ifdef BUG</code> around
a statement which, if removed, makes the bug not happen.  These are just
clutter; we won't pay any attention to them anyway.  Besides, you should
send us cpp output, and that can't have conditionals.

<li>A patch for the bug.

<p>A patch for the bug is useful if it is a good one.  But don't omit the
necessary information, such as the test case, on the assumption that a
patch is all we need.  We might see problems with your patch and decide
to fix the problem another way, or we might not understand it at all.

<p>Sometimes with a program as complicated as GCC it is very hard to
construct an example that will make the program follow a certain path
through the code.  If you don't send the example, we won't be able to
construct one, so we won't be able to verify that the bug is fixed.

<p>And if we can't understand what bug you are trying to fix, or why your
patch should be an improvement, we won't install it.  A test case will
help us to understand.

<p>See <a href="#Sending%20Patches">Sending Patches</a>, for guidelines on how to make it easy for us to
understand and install your patches.

</p><li>A guess about what the bug is or what it depends on.

<p>Such guesses are usually wrong.  Even I can't guess right about such
things without first using the debugger to find the facts.

</p><li>A core dump file.

<p>We have no way of examining a core dump for your type of machine
unless we have an identical system--and if we do have one,
we should be able to reproduce the crash ourselves.

<h2>Sending Patches for GCC</h2>

<p>If you would like to write bug fixes or improvements for the GNU C
compiler, that is very helpful.  Send suggested fixes to the patches
mailing list, <code>gcc-patches@gcc.gnu.org</code>.

<p>Please follow these guidelines so we can study your patches efficiently. 
If you don't follow these guidelines, your information might still be
useful, but using it will take extra work.  Maintaining GNU C is a lot
of work in the best of circumstances, and we can't keep up unless you do
your best to help.

<ul>
<li>Send an explanation with your changes of what problem they fix or what
improvement they bring about.  For a bug fix, just include a copy of the
bug report, and explain why the change fixes the bug.

<p>(Referring to a bug report is not as good as including it, because then
we will have to look it up, and we have probably already deleted it if
we've already fixed the bug.)

</p><li>Always include a proper bug report for the problem you think you have
fixed.  We need to convince ourselves that the change is right before
installing it.  Even if it is right, we might have trouble judging it if
we don't have a way to reproduce the problem.

<li>Include all the comments that are appropriate to help people reading the
source in the future understand why this change was needed.

<li>Don't mix together changes made for different reasons. 
Send them <em>individually</em>.

<p>If you make two changes for separate reasons, then we might not want to
install them both.  We might want to install just one.  If you send them
all jumbled together in a single set of diffs, we have to do extra work
to disentangle them--to figure out which parts of the change serve
which purpose.  If we don't have time for this, we might have to ignore
your changes entirely.

<p>If you send each change as soon as you have written it, with its own
explanation, then the two changes never get tangled up, and we can
consider each one properly without any extra work to disentangle them.

<p>Ideally, each change you send should be impossible to subdivide into
parts that we might want to consider separately, because each of its
parts gets its motivation from the other parts.

</p><li>Send each change as soon as that change is finished.  Sometimes people
think they are helping us by accumulating many changes to send them all
together.  As explained above, this is absolutely the worst thing you
could do.

<p>Since you should send each change separately, you might as well send it
right away.  That gives us the option of installing it immediately if it
is important.

</p><li>Use <code>diff -c</code> to make your diffs.  Diffs without context are hard
for us to install reliably.  More than that, they make it hard for us to
study the diffs to decide whether we want to install them.  Unidiff
format is better than contextless diffs, but not as easy to read as
<code>-c</code> format.

<p>If you have GNU diff, use <code>diff -cp</code>, which shows the name of the
function that each change occurs in.

</p><li>Write the change log entries for your changes.  We get lots of changes,
and we don't have time to do all the change log writing ourselves.

<p>Read the <code>ChangeLog</code> file to see what sorts of information to put
in, and to learn the style that we use.  The purpose of the change log
is to show people where to find what was changed.  So you need to be
specific about what functions you changed; in large functions, it's
often helpful to indicate where within the function the change was.

<p>On the other hand, once you have shown people where to find the change,
you need not explain its purpose.  Thus, if you add a new function, all
you need to say about it is that it is new.  If you feel that the
purpose needs explaining, it probably does--but the explanation will be
much more useful if you put it in comments in the code.

<p>If you would like your name to appear in the header line for who made
the change, send us the header line.

</p><li>When you write the fix, keep in mind that we can't install a change that
would break other systems.

<p>People often suggest fixing a problem by changing machine-independent
files such as <code>toplev.c</code> to do something special that a particular
system needs.  Sometimes it is totally obvious that such changes would
break GCC for almost all users.  We can't possibly make a change like
that.  At best it might tell us how to write another patch that would
solve the problem acceptably.

<p>Sometimes people send fixes that <em>might</em> be an improvement in
general--but it is hard to be sure of this.  It's hard to install
such changes because we have to study them very carefully.  Of course,
a good explanation of the reasoning by which you concluded the change
was correct can help convince us.

<p>The safest changes are changes to the configuration files for a
particular machine.  These are safe because they can't create new bugs
on other machines.

<p>Please help us keep up with the workload by designing the patch in a
form that is good to install.

<br>

<h2>Include Files and VMS</h2>

<p>Due to the differences between the filesystems of Unix and VMS, GCC
attempts to translate file names in <code>#include</code> into names that VMS
will understand.  The basic strategy is to prepend a prefix to the
specification of the include file, convert the whole filename to a VMS
filename, and then try to open the file.  GCC tries various prefixes
one by one until one of them succeeds:

<ol type=1 start=1>
</p><li>The first prefix is the <code>GNU_CC_INCLUDE:</code> logical name: this is
where GNU C header files are traditionally stored.  If you wish to store
header files in non-standard locations, then you can assign the logical
<code>GNU_CC_INCLUDE</code> to be a search list, where each element of the
list is suitable for use with a rooted logical.

<li>The next prefix tried is <code>SYS$SYSROOT:[SYSLIB.]</code>.  This is where
VAX-C header files are traditionally stored.

<li>If the include file specification by itself is a valid VMS filename, the
preprocessor then uses this name with no prefix in an attempt to open
the include file.

<li>If the file specification is not a valid VMS filename (i.e. does not
contain a device or a directory specifier, and contains a <code>/</code>
character), the preprocessor tries to convert it from Unix syntax to
VMS syntax.

<p>Conversion works like this: the first directory name becomes a device,
and the rest of the directories are converted into VMS-format directory
names.  For example, the name <code>X11/foobar.h</code> is
translated to <code>X11:[000000]foobar.h</code> or <code>X11:foobar.h</code>,
whichever one can be opened.  This strategy allows you to assign a
logical name to point to the actual location of the header files.

</p><li>If none of these strategies succeeds, the <code>#include</code> fails.
</ol>

<p>Include directives of the form:

<pre>#include foobar
</pre>

<p>are a common source of incompatibility between VAX-C and GCC.  VAX-C
treats this much like a standard <code>#include &lt;foobar.h&gt;</code> directive. 
That is incompatible with the ANSI C behavior implemented by GCC: to
expand the name <code>foobar</code> as a macro.  Macro expansion should
eventually yield one of the two standard formats for <code>#include</code>:

<pre>#include "<var>file</var>"
#include &lt;<var>file</var>&gt;
</pre>

<p>If you have this problem, the best solution is to modify the source to
convert the <code>#include</code> directives to one of the two standard forms. 
That will work with either compiler.  If you want a quick and dirty fix,
define the file names as macros with the proper expansion, like this:

<pre>#define stdio &lt;stdio.h&gt;
</pre>

<p>This will work, as long as the name doesn't conflict with anything else
in the program.

<p>Another source of incompatibility is that VAX-C assumes that:

<pre>#include "foobar"
</pre>

<p>is actually asking for the file <code>foobar.h</code>.  GCC does not
make this assumption, and instead takes what you ask for literally;
it tries to read the file <code>foobar</code>.  The best way to avoid this
problem is to always specify the desired file extension in your include
directives.

<p>GCC for VMS is distributed with a set of include files that is
sufficient to compile most general purpose programs.  Even though the
GCC distribution does not contain header files to define constants
and structures for some VMS system-specific functions, there is no
reason why you cannot use GCC with any of these functions.  You first
may have to generate or create header files, either by using the public
domain utility <code>UNSDL</code> (which can be found on a DECUS tape), or by
extracting the relevant modules from one of the system macro libraries,
and using an editor to construct a C header file.

<p>A <code>#include</code> file name cannot contain a DECNET node name.  The
preprocessor reports an I/O error if you attempt to use a node name,
whether explicitly, or implicitly via a logical name.

<h2>Global Declarations and VMS</h2>

<p>GCC does not provide the <code>globalref</code>, <code>globaldef</code> and
<code>globalvalue</code> keywords of VAX-C.  You can get the same effect with
an obscure feature of GAS, the GNU assembler.  (This requires GAS
version 1.39 or later.)  The following macros allow you to use this
feature in a fairly natural way:

<pre>#ifdef __GNUC__
#define GLOBALREF(TYPE,NAME)                      \
  TYPE NAME                                       \
  asm ("_$$PsectAttributes_GLOBALSYMBOL$$" #NAME)
#define GLOBALDEF(TYPE,NAME,VALUE)                \
  TYPE NAME                                       \
  asm ("_$$PsectAttributes_GLOBALSYMBOL$$" #NAME) \
    = VALUE
#define GLOBALVALUEREF(TYPE,NAME)                 \
  const TYPE NAME[1]                              \
  asm ("_$$PsectAttributes_GLOBALVALUE$$" #NAME)
#define GLOBALVALUEDEF(TYPE,NAME,VALUE)           \
  const TYPE NAME[1]                              \
  asm ("_$$PsectAttributes_GLOBALVALUE$$" #NAME)  \
    = {VALUE}
#else
#define GLOBALREF(TYPE,NAME) \
  globalref TYPE NAME
#define GLOBALDEF(TYPE,NAME,VALUE) \
  globaldef TYPE NAME = VALUE
#define GLOBALVALUEDEF(TYPE,NAME,VALUE) \
  globalvalue TYPE NAME = VALUE
#define GLOBALVALUEREF(TYPE,NAME) \
  globalvalue TYPE NAME
#endif
</pre>

<p>(The <code>_$$PsectAttributes_GLOBALSYMBOL</code> prefix at the start of the
name is removed by the assembler, after it has modified the attributes
of the symbol).  These macros are provided in the VMS binaries
distribution in a header file <code>GNU_HACKS.H</code>.  An example of the
usage is:

<pre>GLOBALREF (int, ijk);
GLOBALDEF (int, jkl, 0);
</pre>

<p>The macros <code>GLOBALREF</code> and <code>GLOBALDEF</code> cannot be used
straightforwardly for arrays, since there is no way to insert the array
dimension into the declaration at the right place.  However, you can
declare an array with these macros if you first define a typedef for the
array type, like this:

<pre>typedef int intvector[10];
GLOBALREF (intvector, foo);
</pre>

<p>Array and structure initializers will also break the macros; you can
define the initializer to be a macro of its own, or you can expand the
<code>GLOBALDEF</code> macro by hand.  You may find a case where you wish to
use the <code>GLOBALDEF</code> macro with a large array, but you are not
interested in explicitly initializing each element of the array.  In
such cases you can use an initializer like: <code>{0,}</code>, which will
initialize the entire array to <code>0</code>.

<p>A shortcoming of this implementation is that a variable declared with
<code>GLOBALVALUEREF</code> or <code>GLOBALVALUEDEF</code> is always an array.  For
example, the declaration:

<pre>GLOBALVALUEREF(int, ijk);
</pre>

<p>declares the variable <code>ijk</code> as an array of type <code>int [1]</code>. 
This is done because a globalvalue is actually a constant; its "value"
is what the linker would normally consider an address.  That is not how
an integer value works in C, but it is how an array works.  So treating
the symbol as an array name gives consistent results--with the
exception that the value seems to have the wrong type.  <strong>Don't
try to access an element of the array.</strong>  It doesn't have any elements. 
The array "address" may not be the address of actual storage.

<p>The fact that the symbol is an array may lead to warnings where the
variable is used.  Insert type casts to avoid the warnings.  Here is an
example; it takes advantage of the ANSI C feature allowing macros that
expand to use the same name as the macro itself.

<pre>GLOBALVALUEREF (int, ss$_normal);
GLOBALVALUEDEF (int, xyzzy,123);
#ifdef __GNUC__
#define ss$_normal ((int) ss$_normal)
#define xyzzy ((int) xyzzy)
#endif
</pre>

<p>Don't use <code>globaldef</code> or <code>globalref</code> with a variable whose
type is an enumeration type; this is not implemented.  Instead, make the
variable an integer, and use a <code>globalvaluedef</code> for each of the
enumeration values.  An example of this would be:

<pre>#ifdef __GNUC__
GLOBALDEF (int, color, 0);
GLOBALVALUEDEF (int, RED, 0);
GLOBALVALUEDEF (int, BLUE, 1);
GLOBALVALUEDEF (int, GREEN, 3);
#else
enum globaldef color {RED, BLUE, GREEN = 3};
#endif
</pre>

<h2>Other VMS Issues</h2>

<p>GCC automatically arranges for <code>main</code> to return 1 by default if
you fail to specify an explicit return value.  This will be interpreted
by VMS as a status code indicating a normal successful completion. 
Version 1 of GCC did not provide this default.

<p>GCC on VMS works only with the GNU assembler, GAS.  You need version
1.37 or later of GAS in order to produce value debugging information for
the VMS debugger.  Use the ordinary VMS linker with the object files
produced by GAS.

<p>Under previous versions of GCC, the generated code would occasionally
give strange results when linked to the sharable <code>VAXCRTL</code> library. 
Now this should work.

<p>A caveat for use of <code>const</code> global variables: the <code>const</code>
modifier must be specified in every external declaration of the variable
in all of the source files that use that variable.  Otherwise the linker
will issue warnings about conflicting attributes for the variable.  Your
program will still work despite the warnings, but the variable will be
placed in writable storage.

<p>Although the VMS linker does distinguish between upper and lower case
letters in global symbols, most VMS compilers convert all such symbols
into upper case and most run-time library routines also have upper case
names.  To be able to reliably call such routines, GCC (by means of
the assembler GAS) converts global symbols into upper case like other
VMS compilers.  However, since the usual practice in C is to distinguish
case, GCC (via GAS) tries to preserve usual C behavior by augmenting
each name that is not all lower case.  This means truncating the name
to at most 23 characters and then adding more characters at the end
which encode the case pattern of those 23.   Names which contain at
least one dollar sign are an exception; they are converted directly into
upper case without augmentation.

<p>Name augmentation yields bad results for programs that use precompiled
libraries (such as Xlib) which were generated by another compiler.  You
can use the compiler option <code>/NOCASE_HACK</code> to inhibit augmentation;
it makes external C functions and variables case-independent as is usual
on VMS.  Alternatively, you could write all references to the functions
and variables in such libraries using lower case; this will work on VMS,
but is not portable to other systems.  The compiler option <code>/NAMES</code>
also provides control over global name handling.

<p>Function and variable names are handled somewhat differently with GNU
C++.  The GNU C++ compiler performs <dfn>name mangling</dfn> on function
names, which means that it adds information to the function name to
describe the data types of the arguments that the function takes.  One
result of this is that the name of a function can become very long. 
Since the VMS linker only recognizes the first 31 characters in a name,
special action is taken to ensure that each function and variable has a
unique name that can be represented in 31 characters.

<p>If the name (plus a name augmentation, if required) is less than 32
characters in length, then no special action is performed.  If the name
is longer than 31 characters, the assembler (GAS) will generate a
hash string based upon the function name, truncate the function name to
23 characters, and append the hash string to the truncated name.  If the
<code>/VERBOSE</code> compiler option is used, the assembler will print both
the full and truncated names of each symbol that is truncated.

<p>The <code>/NOCASE_HACK</code> compiler option should not be used when you are
compiling programs that use libg++.  libg++ has several instances of
objects (i.e.  <code>Filebuf</code> and <code>filebuf</code>) which become
indistinguishable in a case-insensitive environment.  This leads to
cases where you need to inhibit augmentation selectively (if you were
using libg++ and Xlib in the same program, for example).  There is no
special feature for doing this, but you can get the result by defining a
macro for each mixed case symbol for which you wish to inhibit
augmentation.  The macro should expand into the lower case equivalent of
itself.  For example:

<pre>#define StuDlyCapS studlycaps
</pre>

<p>These macro definitions can be placed in a header file to minimize the
number of changes to your source code.

<h1>GCC and Portability</h1>

<p>The main goal of GCC was to make a good, fast compiler for machines in
the class that the GNU system aims to run on: 32-bit machines that address
8-bit bytes and have several general registers.  Elegance, theoretical
power and simplicity are only secondary.

<p>GCC gets most of the information about the target machine from a machine
description which gives an algebraic formula for each of the machine's
instructions.  This is a very clean way to describe the target.  But when
the compiler needs information that is difficult to express in this
fashion, I have not hesitated to define an ad-hoc parameter to the machine
description.  The purpose of portability is to reduce the total work needed
on the compiler; it was not of interest for its own sake.

<p>GCC does not contain machine dependent code, but it does contain code
that depends on machine parameters such as endianness (whether the most
significant byte has the highest or lowest address of the bytes in a word)
and the availability of autoincrement addressing.  In the RTL-generation
pass, it is often necessary to have multiple strategies for generating code
for a particular kind of syntax tree, strategies that are usable for different
combinations of parameters.  Often I have not tried to address all possible
cases, but only the common ones or only the ones that I have encountered. 
As a result, a new target may require additional strategies.  You will know
if this happens because the compiler will call <code>abort</code>.  Fortunately,
the new strategies can be added in a machine-independent fashion, and will
affect only the target machines that need them.

<h1>Interfacing to GCC Output</h1>

<p>GCC is normally configured to use the same function calling convention
normally in use on the target system.  This is done with the
machine-description macros described (see <a href="#Target%20Macros">Target Macros</a>).

<p>However, returning of structure and union values is done differently on
some target machines.  As a result, functions compiled with PCC
returning such types cannot be called from code compiled with GCC,
and vice versa.  This does not cause trouble often because few Unix
library routines return structures or unions.

<p>GCC code returns structures and unions that are 1, 2, 4 or 8 bytes
long in the same registers used for <code>int</code> or <code>double</code> return
values.  (GCC typically allocates variables of such types in
registers also.)  Structures and unions of other sizes are returned by
storing them into an address passed by the caller (usually in a
register).  The machine-description macros <code>STRUCT_VALUE</code> and
<code>STRUCT_INCOMING_VALUE</code> tell GCC where to pass this address.

<p>By contrast, PCC on most target machines returns structures and unions
of any size by copying the data into an area of static storage, and then
returning the address of that storage as if it were a pointer value. 
The caller must copy the data from that memory area to the place where
the value is wanted.  This is slower than the method used by GCC, and
fails to be reentrant.

<p>On some target machines, such as RISC machines and the 80386, the
standard system convention is to pass to the subroutine the address of
where to return the value.  On these machines, GCC has been
configured to be compatible with the standard compiler, when this method
is used.  It may not be compatible for structures of 1, 2, 4 or 8 bytes.

<p>GCC uses the system's standard convention for passing arguments.  On
some machines, the first few arguments are passed in registers; in
others, all are passed on the stack.  It would be possible to use
registers for argument passing on any machine, and this would probably
result in a significant speedup.  But the result would be complete
incompatibility with code that follows the standard convention.  So this
change is practical only if you are switching to GCC as the sole C
compiler for the system.  We may implement register argument passing on
certain machines once we have a complete GNU system so that we can
compile the libraries with GCC.

<p>On some machines (particularly the Sparc), certain types of arguments
are passed "by invisible reference".  This means that the value is
stored in memory, and the address of the memory location is passed to
the subroutine.

<p>If you use <code>longjmp</code>, beware of automatic variables.  ANSI C says that
automatic variables that are not declared <code>volatile</code> have undefined
values after a <code>longjmp</code>.  And this is all GCC promises to do,
because it is very difficult to restore register variables correctly, and
one of GCC's features is that it can put variables in registers without
your asking it to.

<p>If you want a variable to be unaltered by <code>longjmp</code>, and you don't
want to write <code>volatile</code> because old C compilers don't accept it,
just take the address of the variable.  If a variable's address is ever
taken, even if just to compute it and ignore it, then the variable cannot
go in a register:

<pre>{
  int careful;
  &amp;careful;
  <small>...</small>
}
</pre>

<p>Code compiled with GCC may call certain library routines.  Most of
them handle arithmetic for which there are no instructions.  This
includes multiply and divide on some machines, and floating point
operations on any machine for which floating point support is disabled
with <code>-msoft-float</code>.  Some standard parts of the C library, such as
<code>bcopy</code> or <code>memcpy</code>, are also called automatically.  The usual
function call interface is used for calling the library routines.

<p>These library routines should be defined in the library <code>libgcc.a</code>,
which GCC automatically searches whenever it links a program.  On
machines that have multiply and divide instructions, if hardware
floating point is in use, normally <code>libgcc.a</code> is not needed, but it
is searched just in case.

<p>Each arithmetic function is defined in <code>libgcc1.c</code> to use the
corresponding C arithmetic operator.  As long as the file is compiled
with another C compiler, which supports all the C arithmetic operators,
this file will work portably.  However, <code>libgcc1.c</code> does not work if
compiled with GCC, because each arithmetic function would compile
into a call to itself!

<h1>Passes and Files of the Compiler</h1>

<p>The overall control structure of the compiler is in <code>toplev.c</code>.  This
file is responsible for initialization, decoding arguments, opening and
closing files, and sequencing the passes.

<p>The parsing pass is invoked only once, to parse the entire input.  The RTL
intermediate code for a function is generated as the function is parsed, a
statement at a time.  Each statement is read in as a syntax tree and then
converted to RTL; then the storage for the tree for the statement is
reclaimed.  Storage for types (and the expressions for their sizes),
declarations, and a representation of the binding contours and how they nest,
remain until the function is finished being compiled; these are all needed
to output the debugging information.

<p>Each time the parsing pass reads a complete function definition or
top-level declaration, it calls either the function
<code>rest_of_compilation</code>, or the function
<code>rest_of_decl_compilation</code> in <code>toplev.c</code>, which are
responsible for all further processing necessary, ending with output of
the assembler language.  All other compiler passes run, in sequence,
within <code>rest_of_compilation</code>.  When that function returns from
compiling a function definition, the storage used for that function
definition's compilation is entirely freed, unless it is an inline
function
(see <a href="#Inline">An Inline Function is As Fast As a Macro</a>).

<p>Here is a list of all the passes of the compiler and their source files. 
Also included is a description of where debugging dumps can be requested
with <code>-d</code> options.

<ul>
<li>Parsing.  This pass reads the entire text of a function definition,
constructing partial syntax trees.  This and RTL generation are no longer
truly separate passes (formerly they were), but it is easier to think
of them as separate.

<p>The tree representation does not entirely follow C syntax, because it is
intended to support other languages as well.

<p>Language-specific data type analysis is also done in this pass, and every
tree node that represents an expression has a data type attached. 
Variables are represented as declaration nodes.

<p>Constant folding and some arithmetic simplifications are also done
during this pass.

<p>The language-independent source files for parsing are
<code>stor-layout.c</code>, <code>fold-const.c</code>, and <code>tree.c</code>. 
There are also header files <code>tree.h</code> and <code>tree.def</code>
which define the format of the tree representation.

<p>The source files to parse C are
<code>c-parse.in</code>,
<code>c-decl.c</code>,
<code>c-typeck.c</code>,
<code>c-aux-info.c</code>,
<code>c-convert.c</code>,
and <code>c-lang.c</code>
along with header files
<code>c-lex.h</code>, and
<code>c-tree.h</code>.

<p>The source files for parsing C++ are <code>cp-parse.y</code>,
<code>cp-class.c</code>,<br>
<code>cp-cvt.c</code>, <code>cp-decl.c</code>, <code>cp-decl2.c</code>,
<code>cp-dem.c</code>, <code>cp-except.c</code>,<br>
<code>cp-expr.c</code>, <code>cp-init.c</code>, <code>cp-lex.c</code>,
<code>cp-method.c</code>, <code>cp-ptree.c</code>,<br>
<code>cp-search.c</code>, <code>cp-tree.c</code>, <code>cp-type2.c</code>, and
<code>cp-typeck.c</code>, along with header files <code>cp-tree.def</code>,
<code>cp-tree.h</code>, and <code>cp-decl.h</code>.

<p>The special source files for parsing Objective C are
<code>objc-parse.y</code>, <code>objc-actions.c</code>, <code>objc-tree.def</code>, and
<code>objc-actions.h</code>.  Certain C-specific files are used for this as
well.

<p>The file <code>c-common.c</code> is also used for all of the above languages.

</p><li>RTL generation.  This is the conversion of syntax tree into RTL code. 
It is actually done statement-by-statement during parsing, but for
most purposes it can be thought of as a separate pass.

<p>This is where the bulk of target-parameter-dependent code is found,
since often it is necessary for strategies to apply only when certain
standard kinds of instructions are available.  The purpose of named
instruction patterns is to provide this information to the RTL
generation pass.

<p>Optimization is done in this pass for <code>if</code>-conditions that are
comparisons, boolean operations or conditional expressions.  Tail
recursion is detected at this time also.  Decisions are made about how
best to arrange loops and how to output <code>switch</code> statements.

<p>The source files for RTL generation include
<code>stmt.c</code>,
<code>calls.c</code>,
<code>expr.c</code>,
<code>explow.c</code>,
<code>expmed.c</code>,
<code>function.c</code>,
<code>optabs.c</code>
and <code>emit-rtl.c</code>. 
Also, the file
<code>insn-emit.c</code>, generated from the machine description by the
program <code>genemit</code>, is used in this pass.  The header file
<code>expr.h</code> is used for communication within this pass.

<p>The header files <code>insn-flags.h</code> and <code>insn-codes.h</code>,
generated from the machine description by the programs <code>genflags</code>
and <code>gencodes</code>, tell this pass which standard names are available
for use and which patterns correspond to them.

<p>Aside from debugging information output, none of the following passes
refers to the tree structure representation of the function (only
part of which is saved).

<p>The decision of whether the function can and should be expanded inline
in its subsequent callers is made at the end of rtl generation.  The
function must meet certain criteria, currently related to the size of
the function and the types and number of parameters it has.  Note that
this function may contain loops, recursive calls to itself
(tail-recursive functions can be inlined!), gotos, in short, all
constructs supported by GCC.  The file <code>integrate.c</code> contains
the code to save a function's rtl for later inlining and to inline that
rtl when the function is called.  The header file <code>integrate.h</code>
is also used for this purpose.

<p>The option <code>-dr</code> causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after
this pass.  This dump file's name is made by appending <code>.rtl</code> to
the input file name.

</p><li>Jump optimization.  This pass simplifies jumps to the following
instruction, jumps across jumps, and jumps to jumps.  It deletes
unreferenced labels and unreachable code, except that unreachable code
that contains a loop is not recognized as unreachable in this pass. 
(Such loops are deleted later in the basic block analysis.)  It also
converts some code originally written with jumps into sequences of
instructions that directly set values from the results of comparisons,
if the machine has such instructions.

<p>Jump optimization is performed two or three times.  The first time is
immediately following RTL generation.  The second time is after CSE,
but only if CSE says repeated jump optimization is needed.  The
last time is right before the final pass.  That time, cross-jumping
and deletion of no-op move instructions are done together with the
optimizations described above.

<p>The source file of this pass is <code>jump.c</code>.

<p>The option <code>-dj</code> causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after
this pass is run for the first time.  This dump file's name is made by
appending <code>.jump</code> to the input file name.

</p><li>Register scan.  This pass finds the first and last use of each
register, as a guide for common subexpression elimination.  Its source
is in <code>regclass.c</code>.

<li>Jump threading.  This pass detects a condition jump that branches to an
identical or inverse test.  Such jumps can be <code>threaded</code> through
the second conditional test.  The source code for this pass is in
<code>jump.c</code>.  This optimization is only performed if
<code>-fthread-jumps</code> is enabled.

<li>Common subexpression elimination.  This pass also does constant
propagation.  Its source file is <code>cse.c</code>.  If constant
propagation causes conditional jumps to become unconditional or to
become no-ops, jump optimization is run again when CSE is finished.

<p>The option <code>-ds</code> causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after
this pass.  This dump file's name is made by appending <code>.cse</code> to
the input file name.

</p><li>Global common subexpression elimination.  This pass performs GCSE
using Morel-Renvoise Partial Redundancy Elimination, with the exception
that it does not try to move invariants out of loops - that is left to
the loop optimization pass.  This pass also performs global constant
and copy propagation.

<p>The source file for this pass is gcse.c.

<p>The option <code>-dG</code> causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after
this pass.  This dump file's name is made by appending <code>.gcse</code> to
the input file name.

</p><li>Loop optimization.  This pass moves constant expressions out of loops,
and optionally does strength-reduction and loop unrolling as well. 
Its source files are <code>loop.c</code> and <code>unroll.c</code>, plus the header
<code>loop.h</code> used for communication between them.  Loop unrolling uses
some functions in <code>integrate.c</code> and the header <code>integrate.h</code>.

<p>The option <code>-dL</code> causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after
this pass.  This dump file's name is made by appending <code>.loop</code> to
the input file name.

</p><li>If <code>-frerun-cse-after-loop</code> was enabled, a second common
subexpression elimination pass is performed after the loop optimization
pass.  Jump threading is also done again at this time if it was specified.

<p>The option <code>-dt</code> causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after
this pass.  This dump file's name is made by appending <code>.cse2</code> to
the input file name.

</p><li>Stupid register allocation is performed at this point in a
nonoptimizing compilation.  It does a little data flow analysis as
well.  When stupid register allocation is in use, the next pass
executed is the reloading pass; the others in between are skipped. 
The source file is <code>stupid.c</code>.

<li>Data flow analysis (<code>flow.c</code>).  This pass divides the program
into basic blocks (and in the process deletes unreachable loops); then
it computes which pseudo-registers are live at each point in the
program, and makes the first instruction that uses a value point at
the instruction that computed the value.

<p>This pass also deletes computations whose results are never used, and
combines memory references with add or subtract instructions to make
autoincrement or autodecrement addressing.

<p>The option <code>-df</code> causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after
this pass.  This dump file's name is made by appending <code>.flow</code> to
the input file name.  If stupid register allocation is in use, this
dump file reflects the full results of such allocation.

</p><li>Instruction combination (<code>combine.c</code>).  This pass attempts to
combine groups of two or three instructions that are related by data
flow into single instructions.  It combines the RTL expressions for
the instructions by substitution, simplifies the result using algebra,
and then attempts to match the result against the machine description.

<p>The option <code>-dc</code> causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after
this pass.  This dump file's name is made by appending <code>.combine</code>
to the input file name.

</p><li>Register movement (<code>regmove.c</code>). This pass looks for cases where
matching constraints would force an instruction to need a reload, and
this reload would be a register to register move.  It them attempts
to change the registers used by the instruction to avoid the move
instruction.

<p>The option <code>-dN</code> causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after
this pass.  This dump file's name is made by appending <code>.regmove</code>
to the input file name.

</p><li>Instruction scheduling (<code>sched.c</code>).  This pass looks for
instructions whose output will not be available by the time that it is
used in subsequent instructions.  (Memory loads and floating point
instructions often have this behavior on RISC machines).  It re-orders
instructions within a basic block to try to separate the definition and
use of items that otherwise would cause pipeline stalls.

<p>Instruction scheduling is performed twice.  The first time is immediately
after instruction combination and the second is immediately after reload.

<p>The option <code>-dS</code> causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after this
pass is run for the first time.  The dump file's name is made by
appending <code>.sched</code> to the input file name.

</p><li>Register class preferencing.  The RTL code is scanned to find out
which register class is best for each pseudo register.  The source
file is <code>regclass.c</code>.

<li>Local register allocation (<code>local-alloc.c</code>).  This pass allocates
hard registers to pseudo registers that are used only within one basic
block.  Because the basic block is linear, it can use fast and
powerful techniques to do a very good job.

<p>The option <code>-dl</code> causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after
this pass.  This dump file's name is made by appending <code>.lreg</code> to
the input file name.

</p><li>Global register allocation (<code>global.c</code>).  This pass
allocates hard registers for the remaining pseudo registers (those
whose life spans are not contained in one basic block).

<li>Reloading.  This pass renumbers pseudo registers with the hardware
registers numbers they were allocated.  Pseudo registers that did not
get hard registers are replaced with stack slots.  Then it finds
instructions that are invalid because a value has failed to end up in
a register, or has ended up in a register of the wrong kind.  It fixes
up these instructions by reloading the problematical values
temporarily into registers.  Additional instructions are generated to
do the copying.

<p>The reload pass also optionally eliminates the frame pointer and inserts
instructions to save and restore call-clobbered registers around calls.

<p>Source files are <code>reload.c</code> and <code>reload1.c</code>, plus the header
<code>reload.h</code> used for communication between them.

<p>The option <code>-dg</code> causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after
this pass.  This dump file's name is made by appending <code>.greg</code> to
the input file name.

</p><li>Instruction scheduling is repeated here to try to avoid pipeline stalls
due to memory loads generated for spilled pseudo registers.

<p>The option <code>-dR</code> causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after
this pass.  This dump file's name is made by appending <code>.sched2</code>
to the input file name.

</p><li>Jump optimization is repeated, this time including cross-jumping
and deletion of no-op move instructions.

<p>The option <code>-dJ</code> causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after
this pass.  This dump file's name is made by appending <code>.jump2</code>
to the input file name.

</p><li>Delayed branch scheduling.  This optional pass attempts to find
instructions that can go into the delay slots of other instructions,
usually jumps and calls.  The source file name is <code>reorg.c</code>.

<p>The option <code>-dd</code> causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after
this pass.  This dump file's name is made by appending <code>.dbr</code>
to the input file name.

</p><li>Conversion from usage of some hard registers to usage of a register
stack may be done at this point.  Currently, this is supported only
for the floating-point registers of the Intel 80387 coprocessor.   The
source file name is <code>reg-stack.c</code>.

<p>The options <code>-dk</code> causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after
this pass.  This dump file's name is made by appending <code>.stack</code>
to the input file name.

</p><li>Final.  This pass outputs the assembler code for the function.  It is
also responsible for identifying spurious test and compare
instructions.  Machine-specific peephole optimizations are performed
at the same time.  The function entry and exit sequences are generated
directly as assembler code in this pass; they never exist as RTL.

<p>The source files are <code>final.c</code> plus <code>insn-output.c</code>; the
latter is generated automatically from the machine description by the
tool <code>genoutput</code>.  The header file <code>conditions.h</code> is used
for communication between these files.

</p><li>Debugging information output.  This is run after final because it must
output the stack slot offsets for pseudo registers that did not get
hard registers.  Source files are <code>dbxout.c</code> for DBX symbol table
format, <code>sdbout.c</code> for SDB symbol table format, and
<code>dwarfout.c</code> for DWARF symbol table format. 
</ul>

<p>Some additional files are used by all or many passes:

<ul>
<li>Every pass uses <code>machmode.def</code> and <code>machmode.h</code> which define
the machine modes.

<li>Several passes use <code>real.h</code>, which defines the default
representation of floating point constants and how to operate on them.

<li>All the passes that work with RTL use the header files <code>rtl.h</code>
and <code>rtl.def</code>, and subroutines in file <code>rtl.c</code>.  The tools
<code>gen*</code> also use these files to read and work with the machine
description RTL.

<li>Several passes refer to the header file <code>insn-config.h</code> which
contains a few parameters (C macro definitions) generated
automatically from the machine description RTL by the tool
<code>genconfig</code>.

<li>Several passes use the instruction recognizer, which consists of
<code>recog.c</code> and <code>recog.h</code>, plus the files <code>insn-recog.c</code>
and <code>insn-extract.c</code> that are generated automatically from the
machine description by the tools <code>genrecog</code> and
<code>genextract</code>.

<li>Several passes use the header files <code>regs.h</code> which defines the
information recorded about pseudo register usage, and <code>basic-block.h</code>
which defines the information recorded about basic blocks.

<li><code>hard-reg-set.h</code> defines the type <code>HARD_REG_SET</code>, a bit-vector
with a bit for each hard register, and some macros to manipulate it. 
This type is just <code>int</code> if the machine has few enough hard registers;
otherwise it is an array of <code>int</code> and some of the macros expand
into loops.

<li>Several passes use instruction attributes.  A definition of the
attributes defined for a particular machine is in file
<code>insn-attr.h</code>, which is generated from the machine description by
the program <code>genattr</code>.  The file <code>insn-attrtab.c</code> contains
subroutines to obtain the attribute values for insns.  It is generated
from the machine description by the program <code>genattrtab</code>.

<h1>RTL Representation</h1>

<p>Most of the work of the compiler is done on an intermediate representation
called register transfer language.  In this language, the instructions to be
output are described, pretty much one by one, in an algebraic form that
describes what the instruction does.

<p>RTL is inspired by Lisp lists.  It has both an internal form, made up of
structures that point at other structures, and a textual form that is used
in the machine description and in printed debugging dumps.  The textual
form uses nested parentheses to indicate the pointers in the internal form.

<h2>RTL Object Types</h2>

<p>RTL uses five kinds of objects: expressions, integers, wide integers,
strings and vectors.  Expressions are the most important ones.  An RTL
expression ("RTX", for short) is a C structure, but it is usually
referred to with a pointer; a type that is given the typedef name
<code>rtx</code>.

<p>An integer is simply an <code>int</code>; their written form uses decimal digits. 
A wide integer is an integral object whose type is <code>HOST_WIDE_INT</code>
(see <a href="#Config">Config</a>); their written form uses decimal digits.

<p>A string is a sequence of characters.  In core it is represented as a
<code>char *</code> in usual C fashion, and it is written in C syntax as well. 
However, strings in RTL may never be null.  If you write an empty string in
a machine description, it is represented in core as a null pointer rather
than as a pointer to a null character.  In certain contexts, these null
pointers instead of strings are valid.  Within RTL code, strings are most
commonly found inside <code>symbol_ref</code> expressions, but they appear in
other contexts in the RTL expressions that make up machine descriptions.

<p>A vector contains an arbitrary number of pointers to expressions.  The
number of elements in the vector is explicitly present in the vector. 
The written form of a vector consists of square brackets
(<code>[<small>...</small>]</code>) surrounding the elements, in sequence and with
whitespace separating them.  Vectors of length zero are not created;
null pointers are used instead.

<p>Expressions are classified by <dfn>expression codes</dfn> (also called RTX
codes).  The expression code is a name defined in <code>rtl.def</code>, which is
also (in upper case) a C enumeration constant.  The possible expression
codes and their meanings are machine-independent.  The code of an RTX can
be extracted with the macro <code>GET_CODE (<var>x</var>)</code> and altered with
<code>PUT_CODE (<var>x</var>, <var>newcode</var>)</code>.

<p>The expression code determines how many operands the expression contains,
and what kinds of objects they are.  In RTL, unlike Lisp, you cannot tell
by looking at an operand what kind of object it is.  Instead, you must know
from its context--from the expression code of the containing expression. 
For example, in an expression of code <code>subreg</code>, the first operand is
to be regarded as an expression and the second operand as an integer.  In
an expression of code <code>plus</code>, there are two operands, both of which
are to be regarded as expressions.  In a <code>symbol_ref</code> expression,
there is one operand, which is to be regarded as a string.

<p>Expressions are written as parentheses containing the name of the
expression type, its flags and machine mode if any, and then the operands
of the expression (separated by spaces).

<p>Expression code names in the <code>md</code> file are written in lower case,
but when they appear in C code they are written in upper case.  In this
manual, they are shown as follows: <code>const_int</code>.

<p>In a few contexts a null pointer is valid where an expression is normally
wanted.  The written form of this is <code>(nil)</code>.

<br>

<h2>RTL Classes and Formats</h2>

<p>The various expression codes are divided into several <dfn>classes</dfn>,
which are represented by single characters.  You can determine the class
of an RTX code with the macro <code>GET_RTX_CLASS (<var>code</var>)</code>. 
Currently, <code>rtx.def</code> defines these classes:

<dl>
<dt><code>o</code>
<dd>An RTX code that represents an actual object, such as a register
(<code>REG</code>) or a memory location (<code>MEM</code>, <code>SYMBOL_REF</code>). 
Constants and basic transforms on objects (<code>ADDRESSOF</code>,
<code>HIGH</code>, <code>LO_SUM</code>) are also included.  Note that <code>SUBREG</code>
and <code>STRICT_LOW_PART</code> are not in this class, but in class <code>x</code>.

<br><dt><code>&lt;</code>
<dd>An RTX code for a comparison, such as <code>NE</code> or <code>LT</code>.

<br><dt><code>1</code>
<dd>An RTX code for a unary arithmetic operation, such as <code>NEG</code>,
<code>NOT</code>, or <code>ABS</code>.  This category also includes value extension
(sign or zero) and conversions between integer and floating point.

<br><dt><code>c</code>
<dd>An RTX code for a commutative binary operation, such as <code>PLUS</code> or
<code>AND</code>.  <code>NE</code> and <code>EQ</code> are comparisons, so they have class
<code>&lt;</code>.

<br><dt><code>2</code>
<dd>An RTX code for a non-commutative binary operation, such as <code>MINUS</code>,
<code>DIV</code>, or <code>ASHIFTRT</code>.

<br><dt><code>b</code>
<dd>An RTX code for a bitfield operation.  Currently only
<code>ZERO_EXTRACT</code> and <code>SIGN_EXTRACT</code>.  These have three inputs
and are lvalues (so they can be used for insertion as well).  See <a href="#Bit%20Fields">Bit Fields</a>.

<br><dt><code>3</code>
<dd>An RTX code for other three input operations.  Currently only
<code>IF_THEN_ELSE</code>.

<br><dt><code>i</code>
<dd>An RTX code for an entire instruction:  <code>INSN</code>, <code>JUMP_INSN</code>, and
<code>CALL_INSN</code>. See <a href="#Insns">Insns</a>.

<br><dt><code>m</code>
<dd>An RTX code for something that matches in insns, such as
<code>MATCH_DUP</code>.  These only occur in machine descriptions.

<br><dt><code>x</code>
<dd>All other RTX codes.  This category includes the remaining codes used
only in machine descriptions (<code>DEFINE_*</code>, etc.).  It also includes
all the codes describing side effects (<code>SET</code>, <code>USE</code>,
<code>CLOBBER</code>, etc.) and the non-insns that may appear on an insn
chain, such as <code>NOTE</code>, <code>BARRIER</code>, and <code>CODE_LABEL</code>. 
</dl>

<p>For each expression type <code>rtl.def</code> specifies the number of
contained objects and their kinds, with four possibilities: <code>e</code> for
expression (actually a pointer to an expression), <code>i</code> for integer,
<code>w</code> for wide integer, <code>s</code> for string, and <code>E</code> for vector
of expressions.  The sequence of letters for an expression code is
called its <dfn>format</dfn>.  For example, the format of <code>subreg</code> is
<code>ei</code>.

<p>A few other format characters are used occasionally:

<dl>
<dt><code>u</code>
<dd><code>u</code> is equivalent to <code>e</code> except that it is printed differently
in debugging dumps.  It is used for pointers to insns.

<br><dt><code>n</code>
<dd><code>n</code> is equivalent to <code>i</code> except that it is printed differently
in debugging dumps.  It is used for the line number or code number of a
<code>note</code> insn.

<br><dt><code>S</code>
<dd><code>S</code> indicates a string which is optional.  In the RTL objects in
core, <code>S</code> is equivalent to <code>s</code>, but when the object is read,
from an <code>md</code> file, the string value of this operand may be omitted. 
An omitted string is taken to be the null string.

<br><dt><code>V</code>
<dd><code>V</code> indicates a vector which is optional.  In the RTL objects in
core, <code>V</code> is equivalent to <code>E</code>, but when the object is read
from an <code>md</code> file, the vector value of this operand may be omitted. 
An omitted vector is effectively the same as a vector of no elements.

<br><dt><code>0</code>
<dd><code>0</code> means a slot whose contents do not fit any normal category. 
<code>0</code> slots are not printed at all in dumps, and are often used in
special ways by small parts of the compiler. 
</dl>

<p>There are macros to get the number of operands and the format
of an expression code:

<dl>
<dt><code>GET_RTX_LENGTH (<var>code</var>)</code>
<dd>Number of operands of an RTX of code <var>code</var>.

<br><dt><code>GET_RTX_FORMAT (<var>code</var>)</code>
<dd>The format of an RTX of code <var>code</var>, as a C string. 
</dl>

<p>Some classes of RTX codes always have the same format.  For example, it
is safe to assume that all comparison operations have format <code>ee</code>.

<dl>
<dt><code>1</code>
<dd>All codes of this class have format <code>e</code>.

<br><dt><code>&lt;</code>
<dt><code>c</code>
<dt><code>2</code>
<dd>All codes of these classes have format <code>ee</code>.

<br><dt><code>b</code>
<dt><code>3</code>
<dd>All codes of these classes have format <code>eee</code>.

<br><dt><code>i</code>
<dd>All codes of this class have formats that begin with <code>iuueiee</code>. 
See <a href="#Insns">Insns</a>.  Note that not all RTL objects linked onto an insn chain
are of class <code>i</code>.

<br><dt><code>o</code>
<dt><code>m</code>
<dt><code>x</code>
<dd>You can make no assumptions about the format of these codes.

<h2>Access to Operands</h2>

<p>Operands of expressions are accessed using the macros <code>XEXP</code>,
<code>XINT</code>, <code>XWINT</code> and <code>XSTR</code>.  Each of these macros takes
two arguments: an expression-pointer (RTX) and an operand number
(counting from zero).  Thus,

<pre>XEXP (<var>x</var>, 2)
</pre>

<p>accesses operand 2 of expression <var>x</var>, as an expression.

<pre>XINT (<var>x</var>, 2)
</pre>

<p>accesses the same operand as an integer.  <code>XSTR</code>, used in the same
fashion, would access it as a string.

<p>Any operand can be accessed as an integer, as an expression or as a string. 
You must choose the correct method of access for the kind of value actually
stored in the operand.  You would do this based on the expression code of
the containing expression.  That is also how you would know how many
operands there are.

<p>For example, if <var>x</var> is a <code>subreg</code> expression, you know that it has
two operands which can be correctly accessed as <code>XEXP (<var>x</var>, 0)</code>
and <code>XINT (<var>x</var>, 1)</code>.  If you did <code>XINT (<var>x</var>, 0)</code>, you
would get the address of the expression operand but cast as an integer;
that might occasionally be useful, but it would be cleaner to write
<code>(int) XEXP (<var>x</var>, 0)</code>.  <code>XEXP (<var>x</var>, 1)</code> would also
compile without error, and would return the second, integer operand cast as
an expression pointer, which would probably result in a crash when
accessed.  Nothing stops you from writing <code>XEXP (<var>x</var>, 28)</code> either,
but this will access memory past the end of the expression with
unpredictable results.

<p>Access to operands which are vectors is more complicated.  You can use the
macro <code>XVEC</code> to get the vector-pointer itself, or the macros
<code>XVECEXP</code> and <code>XVECLEN</code> to access the elements and length of a
vector.

<dl>
<dt><code>XVEC (<var>exp</var>, <var>idx</var>)</code>
<dd>Access the vector-pointer which is operand number <var>idx</var> in <var>exp</var>.

<br><dt><code>XVECLEN (<var>exp</var>, <var>idx</var>)</code>
<dd>Access the length (number of elements) in the vector which is
in operand number <var>idx</var> in <var>exp</var>.  This value is an <code>int</code>.

<br><dt><code>XVECEXP (<var>exp</var>, <var>idx</var>, <var>eltnum</var>)</code>
<dd>Access element number <var>eltnum</var> in the vector which is
in operand number <var>idx</var> in <var>exp</var>.  This value is an RTX.

<p>It is up to you to make sure that <var>eltnum</var> is not negative
and is less than <code>XVECLEN (<var>exp</var>, <var>idx</var>)</code>. 
</dl>

<p>All the macros defined in this section expand into lvalues and therefore
can be used to assign the operands, lengths and vector elements as well as
to access them.

<h2>Flags in an RTL Expression</h2>

<p>RTL expressions contain several flags (one-bit bitfields) and other
values that are used in certain types of expression.  Most often they
are accessed with the following macros:

<dl>
<dt><code>MEM_VOLATILE_P (<var>x</var>)</code>
<dd>In <code>mem</code> expressions, nonzero for volatile memory references. 
Stored in the <code>volatil</code> field and printed as <code>/v</code>.

<br><dt><code>MEM_IN_STRUCT_P (<var>x</var>)</code>
<dd>In <code>mem</code> expressions, nonzero for reference to an entire structure,
union or array, or to a component of one.  Zero for references to a
scalar variable or through a pointer to a scalar.  Stored in the
<code>in_struct</code> field and printed as <code>/s</code>.  If both this flag and
MEM_SCALAR_P are clear, then we don't know whether this MEM is in a
structure or not.  Both flags should never be simultaneously set.

<br><dt><code>MEM_SCALAR_P (<var>x</var>)</code>
<dd>In <code>mem</code> expressions, nonzero for reference to a scalar known not
to be a member of a structure, union, or array.  Zero for such
references and for indirections through pointers, even pointers pointing
to scalar types.  If both this flag and MEM_STRUCT_P are clear, then we
don't know whether this MEM is in a structure or not.  Both flags should
never be simultaneously set.

<br><dt><code>MEM_ALIAS_SET (<var>x</var>)</code>
<dd>In <code>mem</code> expressions, the alias set to which <var>x</var> belongs.  If
zero, <var>x</var> is not in any alias set, and may alias anything.  If
nonzero, <var>x</var> may only alias objects in the same alias set.  This
value is set (in a language-specific manner) by the front-end.  This
field is not a bit-field; it is in an integer, found as the second
argument to the <code>mem</code>.

<br><dt><code>REG_LOOP_TEST_P</code>
<dd>In <code>reg</code> expressions, nonzero if this register's entire life is
contained in the exit test code for some loop.  Stored in the
<code>in_struct</code> field and printed as <code>/s</code>.

<br><dt><code>REG_USERVAR_P (<var>x</var>)</code>
<dd>In a <code>reg</code>, nonzero if it corresponds to a variable present in
the user's source code.  Zero for temporaries generated internally by
the compiler.  Stored in the <code>volatil</code> field and printed as
<code>/v</code>.

<br><dt><code>REG_FUNCTION_VALUE_P (<var>x</var>)</code>
<dd>Nonzero in a <code>reg</code> if it is the place in which this function's
value is going to be returned.  (This happens only in a hard
register.)  Stored in the <code>integrated</code> field and printed as
<code>/i</code>.

<p>The same hard register may be used also for collecting the values of
functions called by this one, but <code>REG_FUNCTION_VALUE_P</code> is zero
in this kind of use.

<br><dt><code>SUBREG_PROMOTED_VAR_P</code>
<dd>Nonzero in a <code>subreg</code> if it was made when accessing an object that
was promoted to a wider mode in accord with the <code>PROMOTED_MODE</code> machine
description macro (see <a href="#Storage%20Layout">Storage Layout</a>).  In this case, the mode of
the <code>subreg</code> is the declared mode of the object and the mode of
<code>SUBREG_REG</code> is the mode of the register that holds the object. 
Promoted variables are always either sign- or zero-extended to the wider
mode on every assignment.  Stored in the <code>in_struct</code> field and
printed as <code>/s</code>.

<br><dt><code>SUBREG_PROMOTED_UNSIGNED_P</code>
<dd>Nonzero in a <code>subreg</code> that has <code>SUBREG_PROMOTED_VAR_P</code> nonzero
if the object being referenced is kept zero-extended and zero if it
is kept sign-extended.  Stored in the <code>unchanging</code> field and
printed as <code>/u</code>.

<br><dt><code>RTX_UNCHANGING_P (<var>x</var>)</code>
<dd>Nonzero in a <code>reg</code> or <code>mem</code> if the value is not changed. 
(This flag is not set for memory references via pointers to constants. 
Such pointers only guarantee that the object will not be changed
explicitly by the current function.  The object might be changed by
other functions or by aliasing.)  Stored in the
<code>unchanging</code> field and printed as <code>/u</code>.

<br><dt><code>RTX_INTEGRATED_P (<var>insn</var>)</code>
<dd>Nonzero in an insn if it resulted from an in-line function call. 
Stored in the <code>integrated</code> field and printed as <code>/i</code>.

<br><dt><code>RTX_FRAME_RELATED_P (<var>x</var>)</code>
<dd>Nonzero in an insn or expression which is part of a function
prologue and sets the stack pointer, sets the frame pointer, or saves a
register. This flag is required for exception handling support
on targets with RTL prologues.

<br><dt><code>SYMBOL_REF_USED (<var>x</var>)</code>
<dd>In a <code>symbol_ref</code>, indicates that <var>x</var> has been used.  This is
normally only used to ensure that <var>x</var> is only declared external
once.  Stored in the <code>used</code> field.

<br><dt><code>SYMBOL_REF_FLAG (<var>x</var>)</code>
<dd>In a <code>symbol_ref</code>, this is used as a flag for machine-specific purposes. 
Stored in the <code>volatil</code> field and printed as <code>/v</code>.

<br><dt><code>LABEL_OUTSIDE_LOOP_P</code>
<dd>In <code>label_ref</code> expressions, nonzero if this is a reference to a
label that is outside the innermost loop containing the reference to the
label.  Stored in the <code>in_struct</code> field and printed as <code>/s</code>.

<br><dt><code>INSN_DELETED_P (<var>insn</var>)</code>
<dd>In an insn, nonzero if the insn has been deleted.  Stored in the
<code>volatil</code> field and printed as <code>/v</code>.

<br><dt><code>INSN_ANNULLED_BRANCH_P (<var>insn</var>)</code>
<dd>In an <code>insn</code> in the delay slot of a branch insn, indicates that an
annulling branch should be used.  See the discussion under
<code>sequence</code> below.  Stored in the <code>unchanging</code> field and printed
as <code>/u</code>.

<br><dt><code>INSN_FROM_TARGET_P (<var>insn</var>)</code>
<dd>In an <code>insn</code> in a delay slot of a branch, indicates that the insn
is from the target of the branch.  If the branch insn has
<code>INSN_ANNULLED_BRANCH_P</code> set, this insn will only be executed if
the branch is taken.  For annulled branches with
<code>INSN_FROM_TARGET_P</code> clear, the insn will be executed only if the
branch is not taken.  When <code>INSN_ANNULLED_BRANCH_P</code> is not set,
this insn will always be executed.  Stored in the <code>in_struct</code>
field and printed as <code>/s</code>.

<br><dt><code>CONSTANT_POOL_ADDRESS_P (<var>x</var>)</code>
<dd>Nonzero in a <code>symbol_ref</code> if it refers to part of the current
function's "constants pool".  These are addresses close to the
beginning of the function, and GNU CC assumes they can be addressed
directly (perhaps with the help of base registers).  Stored in the
<code>unchanging</code> field and printed as <code>/u</code>.

<br><dt><code>CONST_CALL_P (<var>x</var>)</code>
<dd>In a <code>call_insn</code>, indicates that the insn represents a call to a const
function.  Stored in the <code>unchanging</code> field and printed as <code>/u</code>.

<br><dt><code>LABEL_PRESERVE_P (<var>x</var>)</code>
<dd>In a <code>code_label</code>, indicates that the label can never be deleted. 
Labels referenced by a non-local goto will have this bit set.  Stored
in the <code>in_struct</code> field and printed as <code>/s</code>.

<br><dt><code>SCHED_GROUP_P (<var>insn</var>)</code>
<dd>During instruction scheduling, in an insn, indicates that the previous insn
must be scheduled together with this insn.  This is used to ensure that
certain groups of instructions will not be split up by the instruction
scheduling pass, for example, <code>use</code> insns before a <code>call_insn</code> may
not be separated from the <code>call_insn</code>.  Stored in the <code>in_struct</code>
field and printed as <code>/s</code>. 
</dl>

<p>These are the fields which the above macros refer to:

<dl>
<dt><code>used</code>
<dd>Normally, this flag is used only momentarily, at the end of RTL
generation for a function, to count the number of times an expression
appears in insns.  Expressions that appear more than once are copied,
according to the rules for shared structure (see <a href="#Sharing">Sharing</a>).

<p>In a <code>symbol_ref</code>, it indicates that an external declaration for
the symbol has already been written.

<p>In a <code>reg</code>, it is used by the leaf register renumbering code to ensure
that each register is only renumbered once.

<br><dt><code>volatil</code>
<dd>This flag is used in <code>mem</code>, <code>symbol_ref</code> and <code>reg</code>
expressions and in insns.  In RTL dump files, it is printed as
<code>/v</code>.

<p>In a <code>mem</code> expression, it is 1 if the memory reference is volatile. 
Volatile memory references may not be deleted, reordered or combined.

<p>In a <code>symbol_ref</code> expression, it is used for machine-specific
purposes.

<p>In a <code>reg</code> expression, it is 1 if the value is a user-level variable. 
0 indicates an internal compiler temporary.

<p>In an insn, 1 means the insn has been deleted.

<br><dt><code>in_struct</code>
<dd>In <code>mem</code> expressions, it is 1 if the memory datum referred to is
all or part of a structure or array; 0 if it is (or might be) a scalar
variable.  A reference through a C pointer has 0 because the pointer
might point to a scalar variable.  This information allows the compiler
to determine something about possible cases of aliasing.

<p>In an insn in the delay slot of a branch, 1 means that this insn is from
the target of the branch.

<p>During instruction scheduling, in an insn, 1 means that this insn must be
scheduled as part of a group together with the previous insn.

<p>In <code>reg</code> expressions, it is 1 if the register has its entire life
contained within the test expression of some loop.

<p>In <code>subreg</code> expressions, 1 means that the <code>subreg</code> is accessing
an object that has had its mode promoted from a wider mode.

<p>In <code>label_ref</code> expressions, 1 means that the referenced label is
outside the innermost loop containing the insn in which the <code>label_ref</code>
was found.

<p>In <code>code_label</code> expressions, it is 1 if the label may never be deleted. 
This is used for labels which are the target of non-local gotos.

<p>In an RTL dump, this flag is represented as <code>/s</code>.

<br><dt><code>unchanging</code>
<dd>In <code>reg</code> and <code>mem</code> expressions, 1 means
that the value of the expression never changes.

<p>In <code>subreg</code> expressions, it is 1 if the <code>subreg</code> references an
unsigned object whose mode has been promoted to a wider mode.

<p>In an insn, 1 means that this is an annulling branch.

<p>In a <code>symbol_ref</code> expression, 1 means that this symbol addresses
something in the per-function constants pool.

<p>In a <code>call_insn</code>, 1 means that this instruction is a call to a
const function.

<p>In an RTL dump, this flag is represented as <code>/u</code>.

<br><dt><code>integrated</code>
<dd>In some kinds of expressions, including insns, this flag means the
rtl was produced by procedure integration.

<p>In a <code>reg</code> expression, this flag indicates the register
containing the value to be returned by the current function.  On
machines that pass parameters in registers, the same register number
may be used for parameters as well, but this flag is not set on such
uses.

<h2>Machine Modes</h2>

<p>A machine mode describes a size of data object and the representation used
for it.  In the C code, machine modes are represented by an enumeration
type, <code>enum machine_mode</code>, defined in <code>machmode.def</code>.  Each RTL
expression has room for a machine mode and so do certain kinds of tree
expressions (declarations and types, to be precise).

<p>In debugging dumps and machine descriptions, the machine mode of an RTL
expression is written after the expression code with a colon to separate
them.  The letters <code>mode</code> which appear at the end of each machine mode
name are omitted.  For example, <code>(reg:SI 38)</code> is a <code>reg</code>
expression with machine mode <code>SImode</code>.  If the mode is
<code>VOIDmode</code>, it is not written at all.

<p>Here is a table of machine modes.  The term "byte" below refers to an
object of <code>BITS_PER_UNIT</code> bits (see <a href="#Storage%20Layout">Storage Layout</a>).

<dl>
<dt><code>QImode</code>
<dd>"Quarter-Integer" mode represents a single byte treated as an integer.

<br><dt><code>HImode</code>
<dd>"Half-Integer" mode represents a two-byte integer.

<br><dt><code>PSImode</code>
<dd>"Partial Single Integer" mode represents an integer which occupies
four bytes but which doesn't really use all four.  On some machines,
this is the right mode to use for pointers.

<br><dt><code>SImode</code>
<dd>"Single Integer" mode represents a four-byte integer.

<br><dt><code>PDImode</code>
<dd>"Partial Double Integer" mode represents an integer which occupies
eight bytes but which doesn't really use all eight.  On some machines,
this is the right mode to use for certain pointers.

<br><dt><code>DImode</code>
<dd>"Double Integer" mode represents an eight-byte integer.

<br><dt><code>TImode</code>
<dd>"Tetra Integer" (?) mode represents a sixteen-byte integer.

<br><dt><code>SFmode</code>
<dd>"Single Floating" mode represents a single-precision (four byte) floating
point number.

<br><dt><code>DFmode</code>
<dd>"Double Floating" mode represents a double-precision (eight byte) floating
point number.

<br><dt><code>XFmode</code>
<dd>"Extended Floating" mode represents a triple-precision (twelve byte)
floating point number.  This mode is used for IEEE extended floating
point.  On some systems not all bits within these bytes will actually
be used.

<br><dt><code>TFmode</code>
<dd>"Tetra Floating" mode represents a quadruple-precision (sixteen byte)
floating point number.

<br><dt><code>CCmode</code>
<dd>"Condition Code" mode represents the value of a condition code, which
is a machine-specific set of bits used to represent the result of a
comparison operation.  Other machine-specific modes may also be used for
the condition code.  These modes are not used on machines that use
<code>cc0</code> (see see <a href="#Condition%20Code">Condition Code</a>).

<br><dt><code>BLKmode</code>
<dd>"Block" mode represents values that are aggregates to which none of
the other modes apply.  In RTL, only memory references can have this mode,
and only if they appear in string-move or vector instructions.  On machines
which have no such instructions, <code>BLKmode</code> will not appear in RTL.

<br><dt><code>VOIDmode</code>
<dd>Void mode means the absence of a mode or an unspecified mode. 
For example, RTL expressions of code <code>const_int</code> have mode
<code>VOIDmode</code> because they can be taken to have whatever mode the context
requires.  In debugging dumps of RTL, <code>VOIDmode</code> is expressed by
the absence of any mode.

<br><dt><code>SCmode, DCmode, XCmode, TCmode</code>
<dd>These modes stand for a complex number represented as a pair of floating
point values.  The floating point values are in <code>SFmode</code>,
<code>DFmode</code>, <code>XFmode</code>, and <code>TFmode</code>, respectively.

<br><dt><code>CQImode, CHImode, CSImode, CDImode, CTImode, COImode</code>
<dd>These modes stand for a complex number represented as a pair of integer
values.  The integer values are in <code>QImode</code>, <code>HImode</code>,
<code>SImode</code>, <code>DImode</code>, <code>TImode</code>, and <code>OImode</code>,
respectively. 
</dl>

<p>The machine description defines <code>Pmode</code> as a C macro which expands
into the machine mode used for addresses.  Normally this is the mode
whose size is <code>BITS_PER_WORD</code>, <code>SImode</code> on 32-bit machines.

<p>The only modes which a machine description <i>must</i> support are
<code>QImode</code>, and the modes corresponding to <code>BITS_PER_WORD</code>,
<code>FLOAT_TYPE_SIZE</code> and <code>DOUBLE_TYPE_SIZE</code>. 
The compiler will attempt to use <code>DImode</code> for 8-byte structures and
unions, but this can be prevented by overriding the definition of
<code>MAX_FIXED_MODE_SIZE</code>.  Alternatively, you can have the compiler
use <code>TImode</code> for 16-byte structures and unions.  Likewise, you can
arrange for the C type <code>short int</code> to avoid using <code>HImode</code>.

<p>Very few explicit references to machine modes remain in the compiler and
these few references will soon be removed.  Instead, the machine modes
are divided into mode classes.  These are represented by the enumeration
type <code>enum mode_class</code> defined in <code>machmode.h</code>.  The possible
mode classes are:

<dl>
<dt><code>MODE_INT</code>
<dd>Integer modes.  By default these are <code>QImode</code>, <code>HImode</code>,
<code>SImode</code>, <code>DImode</code>, and <code>TImode</code>.

<br><dt><code>MODE_PARTIAL_INT</code>
<dd>The "partial integer" modes, <code>PSImode</code> and <code>PDImode</code>.

<br><dt><code>MODE_FLOAT</code>
<dd>floating point modes.  By default these are <code>SFmode</code>, <code>DFmode</code>,
<code>XFmode</code> and <code>TFmode</code>.

<br><dt><code>MODE_COMPLEX_INT</code>
<dd>Complex integer modes.  (These are not currently implemented).

<br><dt><code>MODE_COMPLEX_FLOAT</code>
<dd>Complex floating point modes.  By default these are <code>SCmode</code>,
<code>DCmode</code>, <code>XCmode</code>, and <code>TCmode</code>.

<br><dt><code>MODE_FUNCTION</code>
<dd>Algol or Pascal function variables including a static chain. 
(These are not currently implemented).

<br><dt><code>MODE_CC</code>
<dd>Modes representing condition code values.  These are <code>CCmode</code> plus
any modes listed in the <code>EXTRA_CC_MODES</code> macro.  See <a href="#Jump%20Patterns">Jump Patterns</a>,
also see <a href="#Condition%20Code">Condition Code</a>.

<br><dt><code>MODE_RANDOM</code>
<dd>This is a catchall mode class for modes which don't fit into the above
classes.  Currently <code>VOIDmode</code> and <code>BLKmode</code> are in
<code>MODE_RANDOM</code>. 
</dl>

<p>Here are some C macros that relate to machine modes:

<dl>
<dt><code>GET_MODE (<var>x</var>)</code>
<dd>Returns the machine mode of the RTX <var>x</var>.

<br><dt><code>PUT_MODE (<var>x</var>, <var>newmode</var>)</code>
<dd>Alters the machine mode of the RTX <var>x</var> to be <var>newmode</var>.

<br><dt><code>NUM_MACHINE_MODES</code>
<dd>Stands for the number of machine modes available on the target
machine.  This is one greater than the largest numeric value of any
machine mode.

<br><dt><code>GET_MODE_NAME (<var>m</var>)</code>
<dd>Returns the name of mode <var>m</var> as a string.

<br><dt><code>GET_MODE_CLASS (<var>m</var>)</code>
<dd>Returns the mode class of mode <var>m</var>.

<br><dt><code>GET_MODE_WIDER_MODE (<var>m</var>)</code>
<dd>Returns the next wider natural mode.  For example, the expression
<code>GET_MODE_WIDER_MODE (QImode)</code> returns <code>HImode</code>.

<br><dt><code>GET_MODE_SIZE (<var>m</var>)</code>
<dd>Returns the size in bytes of a datum of mode <var>m</var>.

<br><dt><code>GET_MODE_BITSIZE (<var>m</var>)</code>
<dd>Returns the size in bits of a datum of mode <var>m</var>.

<br><dt><code>GET_MODE_MASK (<var>m</var>)</code>
<dd>Returns a bitmask containing 1 for all bits in a word that fit within
mode <var>m</var>.  This macro can only be used for modes whose bitsize is
less than or equal to <code>HOST_BITS_PER_INT</code>.

<br><dt><code>GET_MODE_ALIGNMENT (<var>m)</var>)</code>
<dd>Return the required alignment, in bits, for an object of mode <var>m</var>.

<br><dt><code>GET_MODE_UNIT_SIZE (<var>m</var>)</code>
<dd>Returns the size in bytes of the subunits of a datum of mode <var>m</var>. 
This is the same as <code>GET_MODE_SIZE</code> except in the case of complex
modes.  For them, the unit size is the size of the real or imaginary
part.

<br><dt><code>GET_MODE_NUNITS (<var>m</var>)</code>
<dd>Returns the number of units contained in a mode, i.e.,
<code>GET_MODE_SIZE</code> divided by <code>GET_MODE_UNIT_SIZE</code>.

<br><dt><code>GET_CLASS_NARROWEST_MODE (<var>c</var>)</code>
<dd>Returns the narrowest mode in mode class <var>c</var>. 
</dl>

<p>The global variables <code>byte_mode</code> and <code>word_mode</code> contain modes
whose classes are <code>MODE_INT</code> and whose bitsizes are either
<code>BITS_PER_UNIT</code> or <code>BITS_PER_WORD</code>, respectively.  On 32-bit
machines, these are <code>QImode</code> and <code>SImode</code>, respectively.

<h2>Constant Expression Types</h2>

<p>The simplest RTL expressions are those that represent constant values.

<dl>
<dt><code>(const_int <var>i</var>)</code>
<dd>This type of expression represents the integer value <var>i</var>.  <var>i</var>
is customarily accessed with the macro <code>INTVAL</code> as in
<code>INTVAL (<var>exp</var>)</code>, which is equivalent to <code>XWINT (<var>exp</var>, 0)</code>.

<p>There is only one expression object for the integer value zero; it is
the value of the variable <code>const0_rtx</code>.  Likewise, the only
expression for integer value one is found in <code>const1_rtx</code>, the only
expression for integer value two is found in <code>const2_rtx</code>, and the
only expression for integer value negative one is found in
<code>constm1_rtx</code>.  Any attempt to create an expression of code
<code>const_int</code> and value zero, one, two or negative one will return
<code>const0_rtx</code>, <code>const1_rtx</code>, <code>const2_rtx</code> or
<code>constm1_rtx</code> as appropriate.

<p>Similarly, there is only one object for the integer whose value is
<code>STORE_FLAG_VALUE</code>.  It is found in <code>const_true_rtx</code>.  If
<code>STORE_FLAG_VALUE</code> is one, <code>const_true_rtx</code> and
<code>const1_rtx</code> will point to the same object.  If
<code>STORE_FLAG_VALUE</code> is -1, <code>const_true_rtx</code> and
<code>constm1_rtx</code> will point to the same object.

<br><dt><code>(const_double:<var>m</var> <var>addr</var> <var>i0</var> <var>i1</var> <small>...</small>)</code>
<dd>Represents either a floating-point constant of mode <var>m</var> or an
integer constant too large to fit into <code>HOST_BITS_PER_WIDE_INT</code>
bits but small enough to fit within twice that number of bits (GNU CC
does not provide a mechanism to represent even larger constants).  In
the latter case, <var>m</var> will be <code>VOIDmode</code>.

<p><var>addr</var> is used to contain the <code>mem</code> expression that corresponds
to the location in memory that at which the constant can be found.  If
it has not been allocated a memory location, but is on the chain of all
<code>const_double</code> expressions in this compilation (maintained using an
undisplayed field), <var>addr</var> contains <code>const0_rtx</code>.  If it is not
on the chain, <var>addr</var> contains <code>cc0_rtx</code>.  <var>addr</var> is
customarily accessed with the macro <code>CONST_DOUBLE_MEM</code> and the
chain field via <code>CONST_DOUBLE_CHAIN</code>.

<p>If <var>m</var> is <code>VOIDmode</code>, the bits of the value are stored in
<var>i0</var> and <var>i1</var>.  <var>i0</var> is customarily accessed with the macro
<code>CONST_DOUBLE_LOW</code> and <var>i1</var> with <code>CONST_DOUBLE_HIGH</code>.

<p>If the constant is floating point (regardless of its precision), then
the number of integers used to store the value depends on the size of
<code>REAL_VALUE_TYPE</code> (see <a href="#Cross-compilation">Cross-compilation</a>).  The integers
represent a floating point number, but not precisely in the target
machine's or host machine's floating point format.  To convert them to
the precise bit pattern used by the target machine, use the macro
<code>REAL_VALUE_TO_TARGET_DOUBLE</code> and friends (see <a href="#Data%20Output">Data Output</a>).

<p>The macro <code>CONST0_RTX (<var>mode</var>)</code> refers to an expression with
value 0 in mode <var>mode</var>.  If mode <var>mode</var> is of mode class
<code>MODE_INT</code>, it returns <code>const0_rtx</code>.  Otherwise, it returns a
<code>CONST_DOUBLE</code> expression in mode <var>mode</var>.  Similarly, the macro
<code>CONST1_RTX (<var>mode</var>)</code> refers to an expression with value 1 in
mode <var>mode</var> and similarly for <code>CONST2_RTX</code>.

<br><dt><code>(const_string <var>str</var>)</code>
<dd>Represents a constant string with value <var>str</var>.  Currently this is
used only for insn attributes (see <a href="#Insn%20Attributes">Insn Attributes</a>) since constant
strings in C are placed in memory.

<br><dt><code>(symbol_ref:<var>mode</var> <var>symbol</var>)</code>
<dd>Represents the value of an assembler label for data.  <var>symbol</var> is
a string that describes the name of the assembler label.  If it starts
with a <code>*</code>, the label is the rest of <var>symbol</var> not including
the <code>*</code>.  Otherwise, the label is <var>symbol</var>, usually prefixed
with <code>_</code>.

<p>The <code>symbol_ref</code> contains a mode, which is usually <code>Pmode</code>. 
Usually that is the only mode for which a symbol is directly valid.

<br><dt><code>(label_ref <var>label</var>)</code>
<dd>Represents the value of an assembler label for code.  It contains one
operand, an expression, which must be a <code>code_label</code> that appears
in the instruction sequence to identify the place where the label
should go.

<p>The reason for using a distinct expression type for code label
references is so that jump optimization can distinguish them.

<br><dt><code>(const:<var>m</var> <var>exp</var>)</code>
<dd>Represents a constant that is the result of an assembly-time
arithmetic computation.  The operand, <var>exp</var>, is an expression that
contains only constants (<code>const_int</code>, <code>symbol_ref</code> and
<code>label_ref</code> expressions) combined with <code>plus</code> and
<code>minus</code>.  However, not all combinations are valid, since the
assembler cannot do arbitrary arithmetic on relocatable symbols.

<p><var>m</var> should be <code>Pmode</code>.

<br><dt><code>(high:<var>m</var> <var>exp</var>)</code>
<dd>Represents the high-order bits of <var>exp</var>, usually a
<code>symbol_ref</code>.  The number of bits is machine-dependent and is
normally the number of bits specified in an instruction that initializes
the high order bits of a register.  It is used with <code>lo_sum</code> to
represent the typical two-instruction sequence used in RISC machines to
reference a global memory location.

<p><var>m</var> should be <code>Pmode</code>.

<h2>Registers and Memory</h2>

<p>Here are the RTL expression types for describing access to machine
registers and to main memory.

<dl>
<dt><code>(reg:<var>m</var> <var>n</var>)</code>
<dd>For small values of the integer <var>n</var> (those that are less than
<code>FIRST_PSEUDO_REGISTER</code>), this stands for a reference to machine
register number <var>n</var>: a <dfn>hard register</dfn>.  For larger values of
<var>n</var>, it stands for a temporary value or <dfn>pseudo register</dfn>. 
The compiler's strategy is to generate code assuming an unlimited
number of such pseudo registers, and later convert them into hard
registers or into memory references.

<p><var>m</var> is the machine mode of the reference.  It is necessary because
machines can generally refer to each register in more than one mode. 
For example, a register may contain a full word but there may be
instructions to refer to it as a half word or as a single byte, as
well as instructions to refer to it as a floating point number of
various precisions.

<p>Even for a register that the machine can access in only one mode,
the mode must always be specified.

<p>The symbol <code>FIRST_PSEUDO_REGISTER</code> is defined by the machine
description, since the number of hard registers on the machine is an
invariant characteristic of the machine.  Note, however, that not
all of the machine registers must be general registers.  All the
machine registers that can be used for storage of data are given
hard register numbers, even those that can be used only in certain
instructions or can hold only certain types of data.

<p>A hard register may be accessed in various modes throughout one
function, but each pseudo register is given a natural mode
and is accessed only in that mode.  When it is necessary to describe
an access to a pseudo register using a nonnatural mode, a <code>subreg</code>
expression is used.

<p>A <code>reg</code> expression with a machine mode that specifies more than
one word of data may actually stand for several consecutive registers. 
If in addition the register number specifies a hardware register, then
it actually represents several consecutive hardware registers starting
with the specified one.

<p>Each pseudo register number used in a function's RTL code is
represented by a unique <code>reg</code> expression.

<p>Some pseudo register numbers, those within the range of
<code>FIRST_VIRTUAL_REGISTER</code> to <code>LAST_VIRTUAL_REGISTER</code> only
appear during the RTL generation phase and are eliminated before the
optimization phases.  These represent locations in the stack frame that
cannot be determined until RTL generation for the function has been
completed.  The following virtual register numbers are defined:

<dl>
<dt><code>VIRTUAL_INCOMING_ARGS_REGNUM</code>
<dd>This points to the first word of the incoming arguments passed on the
stack.  Normally these arguments are placed there by the caller, but the
callee may have pushed some arguments that were previously passed in
registers.

<p>When RTL generation is complete, this virtual register is replaced
by the sum of the register given by <code>ARG_POINTER_REGNUM</code> and the
value of <code>FIRST_PARM_OFFSET</code>.

<br><dt><code>VIRTUAL_STACK_VARS_REGNUM</code>
<dd>If <code>FRAME_GROWS_DOWNWARD</code> is defined, this points to immediately
above the first variable on the stack.  Otherwise, it points to the
first variable on the stack.

<p><code>VIRTUAL_STACK_VARS_REGNUM</code> is replaced with the sum of the
register given by <code>FRAME_POINTER_REGNUM</code> and the value
<code>STARTING_FRAME_OFFSET</code>.

<br><dt><code>VIRTUAL_STACK_DYNAMIC_REGNUM</code>
<dd>This points to the location of dynamically allocated memory on the stack
immediately after the stack pointer has been adjusted by the amount of
memory desired.

<p>This virtual register is replaced by the sum of the register given by
<code>STACK_POINTER_REGNUM</code> and the value <code>STACK_DYNAMIC_OFFSET</code>.

<br><dt><code>VIRTUAL_OUTGOING_ARGS_REGNUM</code>
<dd>This points to the location in the stack at which outgoing arguments
should be written when the stack is pre-pushed (arguments pushed using
push insns should always use <code>STACK_POINTER_REGNUM</code>).

<p>This virtual register is replaced by the sum of the register given by
<code>STACK_POINTER_REGNUM</code> and the value <code>STACK_POINTER_OFFSET</code>. 
</dl>

<br><dt><code>(subreg:<var>m</var> <var>reg</var> <var>wordnum</var>)</code>
<dd><code>subreg</code> expressions are used to refer to a register in a machine
mode other than its natural one, or to refer to one register of
a multi-word <code>reg</code> that actually refers to several registers.

<p>Each pseudo-register has a natural mode.  If it is necessary to
operate on it in a different mode--for example, to perform a fullword
move instruction on a pseudo-register that contains a single
byte--the pseudo-register must be enclosed in a <code>subreg</code>.  In
such a case, <var>wordnum</var> is zero.

<p>Usually <var>m</var> is at least as narrow as the mode of <var>reg</var>, in which
case it is restricting consideration to only the bits of <var>reg</var> that
are in <var>m</var>.

<p>Sometimes <var>m</var> is wider than the mode of <var>reg</var>.  These
<code>subreg</code> expressions are often called <dfn>paradoxical</dfn>.  They are
used in cases where we want to refer to an object in a wider mode but do
not care what value the additional bits have.  The reload pass ensures
that paradoxical references are only made to hard registers.

<p>The other use of <code>subreg</code> is to extract the individual registers of
a multi-register value.  Machine modes such as <code>DImode</code> and
<code>TImode</code> can indicate values longer than a word, values which
usually require two or more consecutive registers.  To access one of the
registers, use a <code>subreg</code> with mode <code>SImode</code> and a
<var>wordnum</var> that says which register.

<p>Storing in a non-paradoxical <code>subreg</code> has undefined results for
bits belonging to the same word as the <code>subreg</code>.  This laxity makes
it easier to generate efficient code for such instructions.  To
represent an instruction that preserves all the bits outside of those in
the <code>subreg</code>, use <code>strict_low_part</code> around the <code>subreg</code>.

<p>The compilation parameter <code>WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN</code>, if set to 1, says
that word number zero is the most significant part; otherwise, it is
the least significant part.

<p>On a few targets, <code>FLOAT_WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN</code> disagrees with
<code>WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN</code>. 
However, most parts of the compiler treat floating point values as if
they had the same endianness as integer values.  This works because
they handle them solely as a collection of integer values, with no
particular numerical value.  Only real.c and the runtime libraries
care about <code>FLOAT_WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN</code>.

<p>Between the combiner pass and the reload pass, it is possible to have a
paradoxical <code>subreg</code> which contains a <code>mem</code> instead of a
<code>reg</code> as its first operand.  After the reload pass, it is also
possible to have a non-paradoxical <code>subreg</code> which contains a
<code>mem</code>; this usually occurs when the <code>mem</code> is a stack slot
which replaced a pseudo register.

<p>Note that it is not valid to access a <code>DFmode</code> value in <code>SFmode</code>
using a <code>subreg</code>.  On some machines the most significant part of a
<code>DFmode</code> value does not have the same format as a single-precision
floating value.

<p>It is also not valid to access a single word of a multi-word value in a
hard register when less registers can hold the value than would be
expected from its size.  For example, some 32-bit machines have
floating-point registers that can hold an entire <code>DFmode</code> value. 
If register 10 were such a register <code>(subreg:SI (reg:DF 10) 1)</code>
would be invalid because there is no way to convert that reference to
a single machine register.  The reload pass prevents <code>subreg</code>
expressions such as these from being formed.

<p>The first operand of a <code>subreg</code> expression is customarily accessed
with the <code>SUBREG_REG</code> macro and the second operand is customarily
accessed with the <code>SUBREG_WORD</code> macro.

<br><dt><code>(scratch:<var>m</var>)</code>
<dd>This represents a scratch register that will be required for the
execution of a single instruction and not used subsequently.  It is
converted into a <code>reg</code> by either the local register allocator or
the reload pass.

<p><code>scratch</code> is usually present inside a <code>clobber</code> operation
(see <a href="#Side%20Effects">Side Effects</a>).

<br><dt><code>(cc0)</code>
<dd>This refers to the machine's condition code register.  It has no
operands and may not have a machine mode.  There are two ways to use it:

<ul>
<li>To stand for a complete set of condition code flags.  This is best on
most machines, where each comparison sets the entire series of flags.

<p>With this technique, <code>(cc0)</code> may be validly used in only two
contexts: as the destination of an assignment (in test and compare
instructions) and in comparison operators comparing against zero
(<code>const_int</code> with value zero; that is to say, <code>const0_rtx</code>).

</p><li>To stand for a single flag that is the result of a single condition. 
This is useful on machines that have only a single flag bit, and in
which comparison instructions must specify the condition to test.

<p>With this technique, <code>(cc0)</code> may be validly used in only two
contexts: as the destination of an assignment (in test and compare
instructions) where the source is a comparison operator, and as the
first operand of <code>if_then_else</code> (in a conditional branch). 
</ul>

<p>There is only one expression object of code <code>cc0</code>; it is the
value of the variable <code>cc0_rtx</code>.  Any attempt to create an
expression of code <code>cc0</code> will return <code>cc0_rtx</code>.

<p>Instructions can set the condition code implicitly.  On many machines,
nearly all instructions set the condition code based on the value that
they compute or store.  It is not necessary to record these actions
explicitly in the RTL because the machine description includes a
prescription for recognizing the instructions that do so (by means of
the macro <code>NOTICE_UPDATE_CC</code>).  See <a href="#Condition%20Code">Condition Code</a>.  Only
instructions whose sole purpose is to set the condition code, and
instructions that use the condition code, need mention <code>(cc0)</code>.

<p>On some machines, the condition code register is given a register number
and a <code>reg</code> is used instead of <code>(cc0)</code>.  This is usually the
preferable approach if only a small subset of instructions modify the
condition code.  Other machines store condition codes in general
registers; in such cases a pseudo register should be used.

<p>Some machines, such as the Sparc and RS/6000, have two sets of
arithmetic instructions, one that sets and one that does not set the
condition code.  This is best handled by normally generating the
instruction that does not set the condition code, and making a pattern
that both performs the arithmetic and sets the condition code register
(which would not be <code>(cc0)</code> in this case).  For examples, search
for <code>addcc</code> and <code>andcc</code> in <code>sparc.md</code>.

<br><dt><code>(pc)</code>
<dd>This represents the machine's program counter.  It has no operands and
may not have a machine mode.  <code>(pc)</code> may be validly used only in
certain specific contexts in jump instructions.

<p>There is only one expression object of code <code>pc</code>; it is the value
of the variable <code>pc_rtx</code>.  Any attempt to create an expression of
code <code>pc</code> will return <code>pc_rtx</code>.

<p>All instructions that do not jump alter the program counter implicitly
by incrementing it, but there is no need to mention this in the RTL.

<br><dt><code>(mem:<var>m</var> <var>addr</var>)</code>
<dd>This RTX represents a reference to main memory at an address
represented by the expression <var>addr</var>.  <var>m</var> specifies how large
a unit of memory is accessed.

<br><dt><code>(addressof:<var>m</var> <var>reg</var>)</code>
<dd>This RTX represents a request for the address of register <var>reg</var>.  Its mode
is always <code>Pmode</code>.  If there are any <code>addressof</code>
expressions left in the function after CSE, <var>reg</var> is forced into the
stack and the <code>addressof</code> expression is replaced with a <code>plus</code>
expression for the address of its stack slot.

<h2>RTL Expressions for Arithmetic</h2>

<p>Unless otherwise specified, all the operands of arithmetic expressions
must be valid for mode <var>m</var>.  An operand is valid for mode <var>m</var>
if it has mode <var>m</var>, or if it is a <code>const_int</code> or
<code>const_double</code> and <var>m</var> is a mode of class <code>MODE_INT</code>.

<p>For commutative binary operations, constants should be placed in the
second operand.

<dl>
<dt><code>(plus:<var>m</var> <var>x</var> <var>y</var>)</code>
<dd>Represents the sum of the values represented by <var>x</var> and <var>y</var>
carried out in machine mode <var>m</var>.

<br><dt><code>(lo_sum:<var>m</var> <var>x</var> <var>y</var>)</code>
<dd>Like <code>plus</code>, except that it represents that sum of <var>x</var> and the
low-order bits of <var>y</var>.  The number of low order bits is
machine-dependent but is normally the number of bits in a <code>Pmode</code>
item minus the number of bits set by the <code>high</code> code
(see <a href="#Constants">Constants</a>).

<p><var>m</var> should be <code>Pmode</code>.

<br><dt><code>(minus:<var>m</var> <var>x</var> <var>y</var>)</code>
<dd>Like <code>plus</code> but represents subtraction.

<br><dt><code>(compare:<var>m</var> <var>x</var> <var>y</var>)</code>
<dd>Represents the result of subtracting <var>y</var> from <var>x</var> for purposes
of comparison.  The result is computed without overflow, as if with
infinite precision.

<p>Of course, machines can't really subtract with infinite precision. 
However, they can pretend to do so when only the sign of the
result will be used, which is the case when the result is stored
in the condition code.   And that is the only way this kind of expression
may validly be used: as a value to be stored in the condition codes.

<p>The mode <var>m</var> is not related to the modes of <var>x</var> and <var>y</var>,
but instead is the mode of the condition code value.  If <code>(cc0)</code>
is used, it is <code>VOIDmode</code>.  Otherwise it is some mode in class
<code>MODE_CC</code>, often <code>CCmode</code>.  See <a href="#Condition%20Code">Condition Code</a>.

<p>Normally, <var>x</var> and <var>y</var> must have the same mode.  Otherwise,
<code>compare</code> is valid only if the mode of <var>x</var> is in class
<code>MODE_INT</code> and <var>y</var> is a <code>const_int</code> or
<code>const_double</code> with mode <code>VOIDmode</code>.  The mode of <var>x</var>
determines what mode the comparison is to be done in; thus it must not
be <code>VOIDmode</code>.

<p>If one of the operands is a constant, it should be placed in the
second operand and the comparison code adjusted as appropriate.

<p>A <code>compare</code> specifying two <code>VOIDmode</code> constants is not valid
since there is no way to know in what mode the comparison is to be
performed; the comparison must either be folded during the compilation
or the first operand must be loaded into a register while its mode is
still known.

<br><dt><code>(neg:<var>m</var> <var>x</var>)</code>
<dd>Represents the negation (subtraction from zero) of the value represented
by <var>x</var>, carried out in mode <var>m</var>.

<br><dt><code>(mult:<var>m</var> <var>x</var> <var>y</var>)</code>
<dd>Represents the signed product of the values represented by <var>x</var> and
<var>y</var> carried out in machine mode <var>m</var>.

<p>Some machines support a multiplication that generates a product wider
than the operands.  Write the pattern for this as

<pre>(mult:<var>m</var> (sign_extend:<var>m</var> <var>x</var>) (sign_extend:<var>m</var> <var>y</var>))
</pre>

<p>where <var>m</var> is wider than the modes of <var>x</var> and <var>y</var>, which need
not be the same.

<p>Write patterns for unsigned widening multiplication similarly using
<code>zero_extend</code>.

<br><dt><code>(div:<var>m</var> <var>x</var> <var>y</var>)</code>
<dd>Represents the quotient in signed division of <var>x</var> by <var>y</var>,
carried out in machine mode <var>m</var>.  If <var>m</var> is a floating point
mode, it represents the exact quotient; otherwise, the integerized
quotient.

<p>Some machines have division instructions in which the operands and
quotient widths are not all the same; you should represent
such instructions using <code>truncate</code> and <code>sign_extend</code> as in,

<pre>(truncate:<var>m1</var> (div:<var>m2</var> <var>x</var> (sign_extend:<var>m2</var> <var>y</var>)))
</pre>

<br><dt><code>(udiv:<var>m</var> <var>x</var> <var>y</var>)</code>
<dd>Like <code>div</code> but represents unsigned division.

<br><dt><code>(mod:<var>m</var> <var>x</var> <var>y</var>)</code>
<dt><code>(umod:<var>m</var> <var>x</var> <var>y</var>)</code>
<dd>Like <code>div</code> and <code>udiv</code> but represent the remainder instead of
the quotient.

<br><dt><code>(smin:<var>m</var> <var>x</var> <var>y</var>)</code>
<dt><code>(smax:<var>m</var> <var>x</var> <var>y</var>)</code>
<dd>Represents the smaller (for <code>smin</code>) or larger (for <code>smax</code>) of
<var>x</var> and <var>y</var>, interpreted as signed integers in mode <var>m</var>.

<br><dt><code>(umin:<var>m</var> <var>x</var> <var>y</var>)</code>
<dt><code>(umax:<var>m</var> <var>x</var> <var>y</var>)</code>
<dd>Like <code>smin</code> and <code>smax</code>, but the values are interpreted as unsigned
integers.

<br><dt><code>(not:<var>m</var> <var>x</var>)</code>
<dd>Represents the bitwise complement of the value represented by <var>x</var>,
carried out in mode <var>m</var>, which must be a fixed-point machine mode.

<br><dt><code>(and:<var>m</var> <var>x</var> <var>y</var>)</code>
<dd>Represents the bitwise logical-and of the values represented by
<var>x</var> and <var>y</var>, carried out in machine mode <var>m</var>, which must be
a fixed-point machine mode.

<br><dt><code>(ior:<var>m</var> <var>x</var> <var>y</var>)</code>
<dd>Represents the bitwise inclusive-or of the values represented by <var>x</var>
and <var>y</var>, carried out in machine mode <var>m</var>, which must be a
fixed-point mode.

<br><dt><code>(xor:<var>m</var> <var>x</var> <var>y</var>)</code>
<dd>Represents the bitwise exclusive-or of the values represented by <var>x</var>
and <var>y</var>, carried out in machine mode <var>m</var>, which must be a
fixed-point mode.

<br><dt><code>(ashift:<var>m</var> <var>x</var> <var>c</var>)</code>
<dd>Represents the result of arithmetically shifting <var>x</var> left by <var>c</var>
places.  <var>x</var> have mode <var>m</var>, a fixed-point machine mode.  <var>c</var>
be a fixed-point mode or be a constant with mode <code>VOIDmode</code>; which
mode is determined by the mode called for in the machine description
entry for the left-shift instruction.  For example, on the Vax, the mode
of <var>c</var> is <code>QImode</code> regardless of <var>m</var>.

<br><dt><code>(lshiftrt:<var>m</var> <var>x</var> <var>c</var>)</code>
<dt><code>(ashiftrt:<var>m</var> <var>x</var> <var>c</var>)</code>
<dd>Like <code>ashift</code> but for right shift.  Unlike the case for left shift,
these two operations are distinct.

<br><dt><code>(rotate:<var>m</var> <var>x</var> <var>c</var>)</code>
<dt><code>(rotatert:<var>m</var> <var>x</var> <var>c</var>)</code>
<dd>Similar but represent left and right rotate.  If <var>c</var> is a constant,
use <code>rotate</code>.

<br><dt><code>(abs:<var>m</var> <var>x</var>)</code>
<dd>Represents the absolute value of <var>x</var>, computed in mode <var>m</var>.

<br><dt><code>(sqrt:<var>m</var> <var>x</var>)</code>
<dd>Represents the square root of <var>x</var>, computed in mode <var>m</var>. 
Most often <var>m</var> will be a floating point mode.

<br><dt><code>(ffs:<var>m</var> <var>x</var>)</code>
<dd>Represents one plus the index of the least significant 1-bit in
<var>x</var>, represented as an integer of mode <var>m</var>.  (The value is
zero if <var>x</var> is zero.)  The mode of <var>x</var> need not be <var>m</var>;
depending on the target machine, various mode combinations may be
valid.

<h2>Comparison Operations</h2>

<p>Comparison operators test a relation on two operands and are considered
to represent a machine-dependent nonzero value described by, but not
necessarily equal to, <code>STORE_FLAG_VALUE</code> (see <a href="#Misc">Misc</a>)
if the relation holds, or zero if it does not.  The mode of the
comparison operation is independent of the mode of the data being
compared.  If the comparison operation is being tested (e.g., the first
operand of an <code>if_then_else</code>), the mode must be <code>VOIDmode</code>. 
If the comparison operation is producing data to be stored in some
variable, the mode must be in class <code>MODE_INT</code>.  All comparison
operations producing data must use the same mode, which is
machine-specific.

<p>There are two ways that comparison operations may be used.  The
comparison operators may be used to compare the condition codes
<code>(cc0)</code> against zero, as in <code>(eq (cc0) (const_int 0))</code>.  Such
a construct actually refers to the result of the preceding instruction
in which the condition codes were set.  The instructing setting the
condition code must be adjacent to the instruction using the condition
code; only <code>note</code> insns may separate them.

<p>Alternatively, a comparison operation may directly compare two data
objects.  The mode of the comparison is determined by the operands; they
must both be valid for a common machine mode.  A comparison with both
operands constant would be invalid as the machine mode could not be
deduced from it, but such a comparison should never exist in RTL due to
constant folding.

<p>In the example above, if <code>(cc0)</code> were last set to
<code>(compare <var>x</var> <var>y</var>)</code>, the comparison operation is
identical to <code>(eq <var>x</var> <var>y</var>)</code>.  Usually only one style
of comparisons is supported on a particular machine, but the combine
pass will try to merge the operations to produce the <code>eq</code> shown
in case it exists in the context of the particular insn involved.

<p>Inequality comparisons come in two flavors, signed and unsigned.  Thus,
there are distinct expression codes <code>gt</code> and <code>gtu</code> for signed and
unsigned greater-than.  These can produce different results for the same
pair of integer values: for example, 1 is signed greater-than -1 but not
unsigned greater-than, because -1 when regarded as unsigned is actually
<code>0xffffffff</code> which is greater than 1.

<p>The signed comparisons are also used for floating point values.  Floating
point comparisons are distinguished by the machine modes of the operands.

<dl>
<dt><code>(eq:<var>m</var> <var>x</var> <var>y</var>)</code>
<dd>1 if the values represented by <var>x</var> and <var>y</var> are equal,
otherwise 0.

<br><dt><code>(ne:<var>m</var> <var>x</var> <var>y</var>)</code>
<dd>1 if the values represented by <var>x</var> and <var>y</var> are not equal,
otherwise 0.

<br><dt><code>(gt:<var>m</var> <var>x</var> <var>y</var>)</code>
<dd>1 if the <var>x</var> is greater than <var>y</var>.  If they are fixed-point,
the comparison is done in a signed sense.

<br><dt><code>(gtu:<var>m</var> <var>x</var> <var>y</var>)</code>
<dd>Like <code>gt</code> but does unsigned comparison, on fixed-point numbers only.

<br><dt><code>(lt:<var>m</var> <var>x</var> <var>y</var>)</code>
<dt><code>(ltu:<var>m</var> <var>x</var> <var>y</var>)</code>
<dd>Like <code>gt</code> and <code>gtu</code> but test for "less than".

<br><dt><code>(ge:<var>m</var> <var>x</var> <var>y</var>)</code>
<dt><code>(geu:<var>m</var> <var>x</var> <var>y</var>)</code>
<dd>Like <code>gt</code> and <code>gtu</code> but test for "greater than or equal".

<br><dt><code>(le:<var>m</var> <var>x</var> <var>y</var>)</code>
<dt><code>(leu:<var>m</var> <var>x</var> <var>y</var>)</code>
<dd>Like <code>gt</code> and <code>gtu</code> but test for "less than or equal".

<br><dt><code>(if_then_else <var>cond</var> <var>then</var> <var>else</var>)</code>
<dd>This is not a comparison operation but is listed here because it is
always used in conjunction with a comparison operation.  To be
precise, <var>cond</var> is a comparison expression.  This expression
represents a choice, according to <var>cond</var>, between the value
represented by <var>then</var> and the one represented by <var>else</var>.

<p>On most machines, <code>if_then_else</code> expressions are valid only
to express conditional jumps.

<br><dt><code>(cond [<var>test1</var> <var>value1</var> <var>test2</var> <var>value2</var> <small>...</small>] <var>default</var>)</code>
<dd>Similar to <code>if_then_else</code>, but more general.  Each of <var>test1</var>,
<var>test2</var>, <small>...</small> is performed in turn.  The result of this expression is
the <var>value</var> corresponding to the first non-zero test, or <var>default</var> if
none of the tests are non-zero expressions.

<p>This is currently not valid for instruction patterns and is supported only
for insn attributes.  See <a href="#Insn%20Attributes">Insn Attributes</a>.

<h2>Bit Fields</h2>

<p>Special expression codes exist to represent bitfield instructions. 
These types of expressions are lvalues in RTL; they may appear
on the left side of an assignment, indicating insertion of a value
into the specified bit field.

<dl>
<dt><code>(sign_extract:<var>m</var> <var>loc</var> <var>size</var> <var>pos</var>)</code>
<dd>This represents a reference to a sign-extended bit field contained or
starting in <var>loc</var> (a memory or register reference).  The bit field
is <var>size</var> bits wide and starts at bit <var>pos</var>.  The compilation
option <code>BITS_BIG_ENDIAN</code> says which end of the memory unit
<var>pos</var> counts from.

<p>If <var>loc</var> is in memory, its mode must be a single-byte integer mode. 
If <var>loc</var> is in a register, the mode to use is specified by the
operand of the <code>insv</code> or <code>extv</code> pattern
(see <a href="#Standard%20Names">Standard Names</a>) and is usually a full-word integer mode,
which is the default if none is specified.

<p>The mode of <var>pos</var> is machine-specific and is also specified
in the <code>insv</code> or <code>extv</code> pattern.

<p>The mode <var>m</var> is the same as the mode that would be used for
<var>loc</var> if it were a register.

<br><dt><code>(zero_extract:<var>m</var> <var>loc</var> <var>size</var> <var>pos</var>)</code>
<dd>Like <code>sign_extract</code> but refers to an unsigned or zero-extended
bit field.  The same sequence of bits are extracted, but they
are filled to an entire word with zeros instead of by sign-extension.

<h2>Conversions</h2>

<p>All conversions between machine modes must be represented by
explicit conversion operations.  For example, an expression
which is the sum of a byte and a full word cannot be written as
<code>(plus:SI (reg:QI 34) (reg:SI 80))</code> because the <code>plus</code>
operation requires two operands of the same machine mode. 
Therefore, the byte-sized operand is enclosed in a conversion
operation, as in

<pre>(plus:SI (sign_extend:SI (reg:QI 34)) (reg:SI 80))
</pre>

<p>The conversion operation is not a mere placeholder, because there
may be more than one way of converting from a given starting mode
to the desired final mode.  The conversion operation code says how
to do it.

<p>For all conversion operations, <var>x</var> must not be <code>VOIDmode</code>
because the mode in which to do the conversion would not be known. 
The conversion must either be done at compile-time or <var>x</var>
must be placed into a register.

<dl>
<dt><code>(sign_extend:<var>m</var> <var>x</var>)</code>
<dd>Represents the result of sign-extending the value <var>x</var>
to machine mode <var>m</var>.  <var>m</var> must be a fixed-point mode
and <var>x</var> a fixed-point value of a mode narrower than <var>m</var>.

<br><dt><code>(zero_extend:<var>m</var> <var>x</var>)</code>
<dd>Represents the result of zero-extending the value <var>x</var>
to machine mode <var>m</var>.  <var>m</var> must be a fixed-point mode
and <var>x</var> a fixed-point value of a mode narrower than <var>m</var>.

<br><dt><code>(float_extend:<var>m</var> <var>x</var>)</code>
<dd>Represents the result of extending the value <var>x</var>
to machine mode <var>m</var>.  <var>m</var> must be a floating point mode
and <var>x</var> a floating point value of a mode narrower than <var>m</var>.

<br><dt><code>(truncate:<var>m</var> <var>x</var>)</code>
<dd>Represents the result of truncating the value <var>x</var>
to machine mode <var>m</var>.  <var>m</var> must be a fixed-point mode
and <var>x</var> a fixed-point value of a mode wider than <var>m</var>.

<br><dt><code>(float_truncate:<var>m</var> <var>x</var>)</code>
<dd>Represents the result of truncating the value <var>x</var>
to machine mode <var>m</var>.  <var>m</var> must be a floating point mode
and <var>x</var> a floating point value of a mode wider than <var>m</var>.

<br><dt><code>(float:<var>m</var> <var>x</var>)</code>
<dd>Represents the result of converting fixed point value <var>x</var>,
regarded as signed, to floating point mode <var>m</var>.

<br><dt><code>(unsigned_float:<var>m</var> <var>x</var>)</code>
<dd>Represents the result of converting fixed point value <var>x</var>,
regarded as unsigned, to floating point mode <var>m</var>.

<br><dt><code>(fix:<var>m</var> <var>x</var>)</code>
<dd>When <var>m</var> is a fixed point mode, represents the result of
converting floating point value <var>x</var> to mode <var>m</var>, regarded as
signed.  How rounding is done is not specified, so this operation may
be used validly in compiling C code only for integer-valued operands.

<br><dt><code>(unsigned_fix:<var>m</var> <var>x</var>)</code>
<dd>Represents the result of converting floating point value <var>x</var> to
fixed point mode <var>m</var>, regarded as unsigned.  How rounding is done
is not specified.

<br><dt><code>(fix:<var>m</var> <var>x</var>)</code>
<dd>When <var>m</var> is a floating point mode, represents the result of
converting floating point value <var>x</var> (valid for mode <var>m</var>) to an
integer, still represented in floating point mode <var>m</var>, by rounding
towards zero.

<h2>Declarations</h2>

<p>Declaration expression codes do not represent arithmetic operations
but rather state assertions about their operands.

<dl>
<dt><code>(strict_low_part (subreg:<var>m</var> (reg:<var>n</var> <var>r</var>) 0))</code>
<dd>This expression code is used in only one context: as the destination operand of a
<code>set</code> expression.  In addition, the operand of this expression
must be a non-paradoxical <code>subreg</code> expression.

<p>The presence of <code>strict_low_part</code> says that the part of the
register which is meaningful in mode <var>n</var>, but is not part of
mode <var>m</var>, is not to be altered.  Normally, an assignment to such
a subreg is allowed to have undefined effects on the rest of the
register when <var>m</var> is less than a word.

<h2>Side Effect Expressions</h2>

<p>The expression codes described so far represent values, not actions. 
But machine instructions never produce values; they are meaningful
only for their side effects on the state of the machine.  Special
expression codes are used to represent side effects.

<p>The body of an instruction is always one of these side effect codes;
the codes described above, which represent values, appear only as
the operands of these.

<dl>
<dt><code>(set <var>lval</var> <var>x</var>)</code>
<dd>Represents the action of storing the value of <var>x</var> into the place
represented by <var>lval</var>.  <var>lval</var> must be an expression
representing a place that can be stored in: <code>reg</code> (or
<code>subreg</code> or <code>strict_low_part</code>), <code>mem</code>, <code>pc</code> or
<code>cc0</code>.

<p>If <var>lval</var> is a <code>reg</code>, <code>subreg</code> or <code>mem</code>, it has a
machine mode; then <var>x</var> must be valid for that mode.

<p>If <var>lval</var> is a <code>reg</code> whose machine mode is less than the full
width of the register, then it means that the part of the register
specified by the machine mode is given the specified value and the
rest of the register receives an undefined value.  Likewise, if
<var>lval</var> is a <code>subreg</code> whose machine mode is narrower than
the mode of the register, the rest of the register can be changed in
an undefined way.

<p>If <var>lval</var> is a <code>strict_low_part</code> of a <code>subreg</code>, then the
part of the register specified by the machine mode of the
<code>subreg</code> is given the value <var>x</var> and the rest of the register
is not changed.

<p>If <var>lval</var> is <code>(cc0)</code>, it has no machine mode, and <var>x</var> may
be either a <code>compare</code> expression or a value that may have any mode. 
The latter case represents a "test" instruction.  The expression
<code>(set (cc0) (reg:<var>m</var> <var>n</var>))</code> is equivalent to
<code>(set (cc0) (compare (reg:<var>m</var> <var>n</var>) (const_int 0)))</code>. 
Use the former expression to save space during the compilation.

<p>If <var>lval</var> is <code>(pc)</code>, we have a jump instruction, and the
possibilities for <var>x</var> are very limited.  It may be a
<code>label_ref</code> expression (unconditional jump).  It may be an
<code>if_then_else</code> (conditional jump), in which case either the
second or the third operand must be <code>(pc)</code> (for the case which
does not jump) and the other of the two must be a <code>label_ref</code>
(for the case which does jump).  <var>x</var> may also be a <code>mem</code> or
<code>(plus:SI (pc) <var>y</var>)</code>, where <var>y</var> may be a <code>reg</code> or a
<code>mem</code>; these unusual patterns are used to represent jumps through
branch tables.

<p>If <var>lval</var> is neither <code>(cc0)</code> nor <code>(pc)</code>, the mode of
<var>lval</var> must not be <code>VOIDmode</code> and the mode of <var>x</var> must be
valid for the mode of <var>lval</var>.

<p><var>lval</var> is customarily accessed with the <code>SET_DEST</code> macro and
<var>x</var> with the <code>SET_SRC</code> macro.

<br><dt><code>(return)</code>
<dd>As the sole expression in a pattern, represents a return from the
current function, on machines where this can be done with one
instruction, such as Vaxes.  On machines where a multi-instruction
"epilogue" must be executed in order to return from the function,
returning is done by jumping to a label which precedes the epilogue, and
the <code>return</code> expression code is never used.

<p>Inside an <code>if_then_else</code> expression, represents the value to be
placed in <code>pc</code> to return to the caller.

<p>Note that an insn pattern of <code>(return)</code> is logically equivalent to
<code>(set (pc) (return))</code>, but the latter form is never used.

<br><dt><code>(call <var>function</var> <var>nargs</var>)</code>
<dd>Represents a function call.  <var>function</var> is a <code>mem</code> expression
whose address is the address of the function to be called. 
<var>nargs</var> is an expression which can be used for two purposes: on
some machines it represents the number of bytes of stack argument; on
others, it represents the number of argument registers.

<p>Each machine has a standard machine mode which <var>function</var> must
have.  The machine description defines macro <code>FUNCTION_MODE</code> to
expand into the requisite mode name.  The purpose of this mode is to
specify what kind of addressing is allowed, on machines where the
allowed kinds of addressing depend on the machine mode being
addressed.

<br><dt><code>(clobber <var>x</var>)</code>
<dd>Represents the storing or possible storing of an unpredictable,
undescribed value into <var>x</var>, which must be a <code>reg</code>,
<code>scratch</code> or <code>mem</code> expression.

<p>One place this is used is in string instructions that store standard
values into particular hard registers.  It may not be worth the
trouble to describe the values that are stored, but it is essential to
inform the compiler that the registers will be altered, lest it
attempt to keep data in them across the string instruction.

<p>If <var>x</var> is <code>(mem:BLK (const_int 0))</code>, it means that all memory
locations must be presumed clobbered.

<p>Note that the machine description classifies certain hard registers as
"call-clobbered".  All function call instructions are assumed by
default to clobber these registers, so there is no need to use
<code>clobber</code> expressions to indicate this fact.  Also, each function
call is assumed to have the potential to alter any memory location,
unless the function is declared <code>const</code>.

<p>If the last group of expressions in a <code>parallel</code> are each a
<code>clobber</code> expression whose arguments are <code>reg</code> or
<code>match_scratch</code> (see <a href="#RTL%20Template">RTL Template</a>) expressions, the combiner
phase can add the appropriate <code>clobber</code> expressions to an insn it
has constructed when doing so will cause a pattern to be matched.

<p>This feature can be used, for example, on a machine that whose multiply
and add instructions don't use an MQ register but which has an
add-accumulate instruction that does clobber the MQ register.  Similarly,
a combined instruction might require a temporary register while the
constituent instructions might not.

<p>When a <code>clobber</code> expression for a register appears inside a
<code>parallel</code> with other side effects, the register allocator
guarantees that the register is unoccupied both before and after that
insn.  However, the reload phase may allocate a register used for one of
the inputs unless the <code>&amp;</code> constraint is specified for the selected
alternative (see <a href="#Modifiers">Modifiers</a>).  You can clobber either a specific hard
register, a pseudo register, or a <code>scratch</code> expression; in the
latter two cases, GNU CC will allocate a hard register that is available
there for use as a temporary.

<p>For instructions that require a temporary register, you should use
<code>scratch</code> instead of a pseudo-register because this will allow the
combiner phase to add the <code>clobber</code> when required.  You do this by
coding (<code>clobber</code> (<code>match_scratch</code> <small>...</small>)).  If you do
clobber a pseudo register, use one which appears nowhere else--generate
a new one each time.  Otherwise, you may confuse CSE.

<p>There is one other known use for clobbering a pseudo register in a
<code>parallel</code>: when one of the input operands of the insn is also
clobbered by the insn.  In this case, using the same pseudo register in
the clobber and elsewhere in the insn produces the expected results.

<br><dt><code>(use <var>x</var>)</code>
<dd>Represents the use of the value of <var>x</var>.  It indicates that the
value in <var>x</var> at this point in the program is needed, even though
it may not be apparent why this is so.  Therefore, the compiler will
not attempt to delete previous instructions whose only effect is to
store a value in <var>x</var>.  <var>x</var> must be a <code>reg</code> expression.

<p>During the reload phase, an insn that has a <code>use</code> as pattern
can carry a reg_equal note.  These <code>use</code> insns will be deleted
before the reload phase exits.

<p>During the delayed branch scheduling phase, <var>x</var> may be an insn. 
This indicates that <var>x</var> previously was located at this place in the
code and its data dependencies need to be taken into account.  These
<code>use</code> insns will be deleted before the delayed branch scheduling
phase exits.

<br><dt><code>(parallel [<var>x0</var> <var>x1</var> <small>...</small>])</code>
<dd>Represents several side effects performed in parallel.  The square
brackets stand for a vector; the operand of <code>parallel</code> is a
vector of expressions.  <var>x0</var>, <var>x1</var> and so on are individual
side effect expressions--expressions of code <code>set</code>, <code>call</code>,
<code>return</code>, <code>clobber</code> or <code>use</code>.

<p>"In parallel" means that first all the values used in the individual
side-effects are computed, and second all the actual side-effects are
performed.  For example,

<pre>(parallel [(set (reg:SI 1) (mem:SI (reg:SI 1)))
           (set (mem:SI (reg:SI 1)) (reg:SI 1))])
</pre>

<p>says unambiguously that the values of hard register 1 and the memory
location addressed by it are interchanged.  In both places where
<code>(reg:SI 1)</code> appears as a memory address it refers to the value
in register 1 <em>before</em> the execution of the insn.

<p>It follows that it is <em>incorrect</em> to use <code>parallel</code> and
expect the result of one <code>set</code> to be available for the next one. 
For example, people sometimes attempt to represent a jump-if-zero
instruction this way:

<pre>(parallel [(set (cc0) (reg:SI 34))
           (set (pc) (if_then_else
                        (eq (cc0) (const_int 0))
                        (label_ref <small>...</small>)
                        (pc)))])
</pre>

<p>But this is incorrect, because it says that the jump condition depends
on the condition code value <em>before</em> this instruction, not on the
new value that is set by this instruction.

<p>Peephole optimization, which takes place together with final assembly
code output, can produce insns whose patterns consist of a <code>parallel</code>
whose elements are the operands needed to output the resulting
assembler code--often <code>reg</code>, <code>mem</code> or constant expressions. 
This would not be well-formed RTL at any other stage in compilation,
but it is ok then because no further optimization remains to be done. 
However, the definition of the macro <code>NOTICE_UPDATE_CC</code>, if
any, must deal with such insns if you define any peephole optimizations.

<br><dt><code>(sequence [<var>insns</var> <small>...</small>])</code>
<dd>Represents a sequence of insns.  Each of the <var>insns</var> that appears
in the vector is suitable for appearing in the chain of insns, so it
must be an <code>insn</code>, <code>jump_insn</code>, <code>call_insn</code>,
<code>code_label</code>, <code>barrier</code> or <code>note</code>.

<p>A <code>sequence</code> RTX is never placed in an actual insn during RTL
generation.  It represents the sequence of insns that result from a
<code>define_expand</code> <em>before</em> those insns are passed to
<code>emit_insn</code> to insert them in the chain of insns.  When actually
inserted, the individual sub-insns are separated out and the
<code>sequence</code> is forgotten.

<p>After delay-slot scheduling is completed, an insn and all the insns that
reside in its delay slots are grouped together into a <code>sequence</code>. 
The insn requiring the delay slot is the first insn in the vector;
subsequent insns are to be placed in the delay slot.

<p><code>INSN_ANNULLED_BRANCH_P</code> is set on an insn in a delay slot to
indicate that a branch insn should be used that will conditionally annul
the effect of the insns in the delay slots.  In such a case,
<code>INSN_FROM_TARGET_P</code> indicates that the insn is from the target of
the branch and should be executed only if the branch is taken; otherwise
the insn should be executed only if the branch is not taken. 
See <a href="#Delay%20Slots">Delay Slots</a>.

<p>These expression codes appear in place of a side effect, as the body of
an insn, though strictly speaking they do not always describe side
effects as such:

<dl>
<dt><code>(asm_input <var>s</var>)</code>
<dd>Represents literal assembler code as described by the string <var>s</var>.

<br><dt><code>(unspec [<var>operands</var> <small>...</small>] <var>index</var>)</code>
<dt><code>(unspec_volatile [<var>operands</var> <small>...</small>] <var>index</var>)</code>
<dd>Represents a machine-specific operation on <var>operands</var>.  <var>index</var>
selects between multiple machine-specific operations. 
<code>unspec_volatile</code> is used for volatile operations and operations
that may trap; <code>unspec</code> is used for other operations.

<p>These codes may appear inside a <code>pattern</code> of an
insn, inside a <code>parallel</code>, or inside an expression.

<br><dt><code>(addr_vec:<var>m</var> [<var>lr0</var> <var>lr1</var> <small>...</small>])</code>
<dd>Represents a table of jump addresses.  The vector elements <var>lr0</var>,

how much space is given to each address; normally <var>m</var> would be

<h2>Embedded Side-Effects on Addresses</h2>

<p>Six special side-effect expression codes appear as memory addresses.

<dl>
<dt><code>(pre_dec:<var>m</var> <var>x</var>)</code>
<dd>Represents the side effect of decrementing <var>x</var> by a standard
amount and represents also the value that <var>x</var> has after being
decremented.  <var>x</var> must be a <code>reg</code> or <code>mem</code>, but most
machines allow only a <code>reg</code>.  <var>m</var> must be the machine mode
for pointers on the machine in use.  The amount <var>x</var> is decremented
by is the length in bytes of the machine mode of the containing memory
reference of which this expression serves as the address.  Here is an
example of its use:

<pre>(mem:DF (pre_dec:SI (reg:SI 39)))
</pre>

<p>This says to decrement pseudo register 39 by the length of a <code>DFmode</code>
value and use the result to address a <code>DFmode</code> value.

<br><dt><code>(pre_inc:<var>m</var> <var>x</var>)</code>
<dd>Similar, but specifies incrementing <var>x</var> instead of decrementing it.

<br><dt><code>(post_dec:<var>m</var> <var>x</var>)</code>
<dd>Represents the same side effect as <code>pre_dec</code> but a different
value.  The value represented here is the value <var>x</var> has <i>before</i>
being decremented.

<br><dt><code>(post_inc:<var>m</var> <var>x</var>)</code>
<dd>Similar, but specifies incrementing <var>x</var> instead of decrementing it.

<br><dt><code>(post_modify:<var>m</var> <var>x</var> <var>y</var>)</code>
<dd>
Represents the side effect of setting <var>x</var> to <var>y</var> and
represents <var>x</var> before <var>x</var> is modified.  <var>x</var> must be a
<code>reg</code> or <code>mem</code>, but most machines allow only a <code>reg</code>. 
<var>m</var> must be the machine mode for pointers on the machine in use. 
The amount <var>x</var> is decremented by is the length in bytes of the
machine mode of the containing memory reference of which this expression
serves as the address.  Note that this is not currently implemented.

<p>The expression <var>y</var> must be one of three forms:
<dl>
<code>(plus:<var>m</var> <var>x</var> <var>z</var>)</code>,
<code>(minus:<var>m</var> <var>x</var> <var>z</var>)</code>, or
<code>(plus:<var>m</var> <var>x</var> <var>i</var>)</code>,
</dl>
where <var>z</var> is an index register and <var>i</var> is a constant.

<p>Here is an example of its use:

<pre>(mem:SF (post_modify:SI (reg:SI 42) (plus (reg:SI 42) (reg:SI 48))))
</pre>

<p>This says to modify pseudo register 42 by adding the contents of pseudo
register 48 to it, after the use of what ever 42 points to.

<br><dt><code>(pre_modify:<var>m</var> <var>x</var> <var>expr</var>)</code>
<dd>Similar except side effects happen before the use. 
</dl>

<p>These embedded side effect expressions must be used with care.  Instruction
patterns may not use them.  Until the <code>flow</code> pass of the compiler,
they may occur only to represent pushes onto the stack.  The <code>flow</code>
pass finds cases where registers are incremented or decremented in one
instruction and used as an address shortly before or after; these cases are
then transformed to use pre- or post-increment or -decrement.

<p>If a register used as the operand of these expressions is used in
another address in an insn, the original value of the register is used. 
Uses of the register outside of an address are not permitted within the
same insn as a use in an embedded side effect expression because such
insns behave differently on different machines and hence must be treated
as ambiguous and disallowed.

<p>An instruction that can be represented with an embedded side effect
could also be represented using <code>parallel</code> containing an additional
<code>set</code> to describe how the address register is altered.  This is not
done because machines that allow these operations at all typically
allow them wherever a memory address is called for.  Describing them as
additional parallel stores would require doubling the number of entries
in the machine description.

<h2>Assembler Instructions as Expressions</h2>

<p>The RTX code <code>asm_operands</code> represents a value produced by a
user-specified assembler instruction.  It is used to represent
an <code>asm</code> statement with arguments.  An <code>asm</code> statement with
a single output operand, like this:

<pre>asm ("foo %1,%2,%0" : "=a" (outputvar) : "g" (x + y), "di" (*z));
</pre>

<p>is represented using a single <code>asm_operands</code> RTX which represents
the value that is stored in <code>outputvar</code>:

<pre>(set <var>rtx-for-outputvar</var>
     (asm_operands "foo %1,%2,%0" "a" 0
                   [<var>rtx-for-addition-result</var> <var>rtx-for-*z</var>]
                   [(asm_input:<var>m1</var> "g")
                    (asm_input:<var>m2</var> "di")]))
</pre>

<p>Here the operands of the <code>asm_operands</code> RTX are the assembler
template string, the output-operand's constraint, the index-number of the
output operand among the output operands specified, a vector of input
operand RTX's, and a vector of input-operand modes and constraints.  The
mode <var>m1</var> is the mode of the sum <code>x+y</code>; <var>m2</var> is that of
<code>*z</code>.

<p>When an <code>asm</code> statement has multiple output values, its insn has
several such <code>set</code> RTX's inside of a <code>parallel</code>.  Each <code>set</code>
contains a <code>asm_operands</code>; all of these share the same assembler
template and vectors, but each contains the constraint for the respective
output operand.  They are also distinguished by the output-operand index
number, which is 0, 1, <small>...</small> for successive output operands.

<h2>Insns</h2>

<p>The RTL representation of the code for a function is a doubly-linked
chain of objects called <dfn>insns</dfn>.  Insns are expressions with
special codes that are used for no other purpose.  Some insns are
actual instructions; others represent dispatch tables for <code>switch</code>
statements; others represent labels to jump to or various sorts of
declarative information.

<p>In addition to its own specific data, each insn must have a unique
id-number that distinguishes it from all other insns in the current
function (after delayed branch scheduling, copies of an insn with the
same id-number may be present in multiple places in a function, but
these copies will always be identical and will only appear inside a
<code>sequence</code>), and chain pointers to the preceding and following
insns.  These three fields occupy the same position in every insn,
independent of the expression code of the insn.  They could be accessed
with <code>XEXP</code> and <code>XINT</code>, but instead three special macros are
always used:

<dl>
<dt><code>INSN_UID (<var>i</var>)</code>
<dd>Accesses the unique id of insn <var>i</var>.

<br><dt><code>PREV_INSN (<var>i</var>)</code>
<dd>Accesses the chain pointer to the insn preceding <var>i</var>. 
If <var>i</var> is the first insn, this is a null pointer.

<br><dt><code>NEXT_INSN (<var>i</var>)</code>
<dd>Accesses the chain pointer to the insn following <var>i</var>. 
If <var>i</var> is the last insn, this is a null pointer. 
</dl>

<p>The first insn in the chain is obtained by calling <code>get_insns</code>; the
last insn is the result of calling <code>get_last_insn</code>.  Within the
chain delimited by these insns, the <code>NEXT_INSN</code> and
<code>PREV_INSN</code> pointers must always correspond: if <var>insn</var> is not
the first insn,

<pre>NEXT_INSN (PREV_INSN (<var>insn</var>)) == <var>insn</var>
</pre>

<p>is always true and if <var>insn</var> is not the last insn,

<pre>PREV_INSN (NEXT_INSN (<var>insn</var>)) == <var>insn</var>
</pre>

<p>is always true.

<p>After delay slot scheduling, some of the insns in the chain might be
<code>sequence</code> expressions, which contain a vector of insns.  The value
of <code>NEXT_INSN</code> in all but the last of these insns is the next insn
in the vector; the value of <code>NEXT_INSN</code> of the last insn in the vector
is the same as the value of <code>NEXT_INSN</code> for the <code>sequence</code> in
which it is contained.  Similar rules apply for <code>PREV_INSN</code>.

<p>This means that the above invariants are not necessarily true for insns
inside <code>sequence</code> expressions.  Specifically, if <var>insn</var> is the
first insn in a <code>sequence</code>, <code>NEXT_INSN (PREV_INSN (<var>insn</var>))</code>
is the insn containing the <code>sequence</code> expression, as is the value
of <code>PREV_INSN (NEXT_INSN (<var>insn</var>))</code> is <var>insn</var> is the last
insn in the <code>sequence</code> expression.  You can use these expressions
to find the containing <code>sequence</code> expression.

<p>Every insn has one of the following six expression codes:

<dl>
<dt><code>insn</code>
<dd>The expression code <code>insn</code> is used for instructions that do not jump
and do not do function calls.  <code>sequence</code> expressions are always
contained in insns with code <code>insn</code> even if one of those insns
should jump or do function calls.

<p>Insns with code <code>insn</code> have four additional fields beyond the three
mandatory ones listed above.  These four are described in a table below.

<br><dt><code>jump_insn</code>
<dd>The expression code <code>jump_insn</code> is used for instructions that may
jump (or, more generally, may contain <code>label_ref</code> expressions).  If
there is an instruction to return from the current function, it is
recorded as a <code>jump_insn</code>.

<p><code>jump_insn</code> insns have the same extra fields as <code>insn</code> insns,
accessed in the same way and in addition contain a field
<code>JUMP_LABEL</code> which is defined once jump optimization has completed.

<p>For simple conditional and unconditional jumps, this field contains the
<code>code_label</code> to which this insn will (possibly conditionally)
branch.  In a more complex jump, <code>JUMP_LABEL</code> records one of the
labels that the insn refers to; the only way to find the others
is to scan the entire body of the insn.

<p>Return insns count as jumps, but since they do not refer to any labels,
they have zero in the <code>JUMP_LABEL</code> field.

<br><dt><code>call_insn</code>
<dd>The expression code <code>call_insn</code> is used for instructions that may do
function calls.  It is important to distinguish these instructions because
they imply that certain registers and memory locations may be altered
unpredictably.

<p><code>call_insn</code> insns have the same extra fields as <code>insn</code> insns,
accessed in the same way and in addition contain a field
<code>CALL_INSN_FUNCTION_USAGE</code>, which contains a list (chain of
<code>expr_list</code> expressions) containing <code>use</code> and <code>clobber</code>
expressions that denote hard registers used or clobbered by the called
function.  A register specified in a <code>clobber</code> in this list is
modified <em>after</em> the execution of the <code>call_insn</code>, while a
register in a <code>clobber</code> in the body of the <code>call_insn</code> is
clobbered before the insn completes execution.  <code>clobber</code>
expressions in this list augment registers specified in
<code>CALL_USED_REGISTERS</code> (see <a href="#Register%20Basics">Register Basics</a>).

<br><dt><code>code_label</code>
<dd>A <code>code_label</code> insn represents a label that a jump insn can jump
to.  It contains two special fields of data in addition to the three
standard ones.  <code>CODE_LABEL_NUMBER</code> is used to hold the <dfn>label
number</dfn>, a number that identifies this label uniquely among all the
labels in the compilation (not just in the current function). 
Ultimately, the label is represented in the assembler output as an
assembler label, usually of the form <code>L<var>n</var></code> where <var>n</var> is
the label number.

<p>When a <code>code_label</code> appears in an RTL expression, it normally
appears within a <code>label_ref</code> which represents the address of
the label, as a number.

<p>The field <code>LABEL_NUSES</code> is only defined once the jump optimization
phase is completed and contains the number of times this label is
referenced in the current function.

<br><dt><code>barrier</code>
<dd>Barriers are placed in the instruction stream when control cannot flow
past them.  They are placed after unconditional jump instructions to
indicate that the jumps are unconditional and after calls to
<code>volatile</code> functions, which do not return (e.g., <code>exit</code>). 
They contain no information beyond the three standard fields.

<br><dt><code>note</code>
<dd><code>note</code> insns are used to represent additional debugging and
declarative information.  They contain two nonstandard fields, an
integer which is accessed with the macro <code>NOTE_LINE_NUMBER</code> and a
string accessed with <code>NOTE_SOURCE_FILE</code>.

<p>If <code>NOTE_LINE_NUMBER</code> is positive, the note represents the
position of a source line and <code>NOTE_SOURCE_FILE</code> is the source file name
that the line came from.  These notes control generation of line
number data in the assembler output.

<p>Otherwise, <code>NOTE_LINE_NUMBER</code> is not really a line number but a
code with one of the following values (and <code>NOTE_SOURCE_FILE</code>
must contain a null pointer):

<dl>
<dt><code>NOTE_INSN_DELETED</code>
<dd>Such a note is completely ignorable.  Some passes of the compiler
delete insns by altering them into notes of this kind.

<br><dt><code>NOTE_INSN_BLOCK_BEG</code>
<dt><code>NOTE_INSN_BLOCK_END</code>
<dd>These types of notes indicate the position of the beginning and end
of a level of scoping of variable names.  They control the output
of debugging information.

<br><dt><code>NOTE_INSN_EH_REGION_BEG</code>
<dt><code>NOTE_INSN_EH_REGION_END</code>
<dd>These types of notes indicate the position of the beginning and end of a
level of scoping for exception handling.  <code>NOTE_BLOCK_NUMBER</code>
identifies which <code>CODE_LABEL</code> is associated with the given region.

<br><dt><code>NOTE_INSN_LOOP_BEG</code>
<dt><code>NOTE_INSN_LOOP_END</code>
<dd>These types of notes indicate the position of the beginning and end
of a <code>while</code> or <code>for</code> loop.  They enable the loop optimizer
to find loops quickly.

<br><dt><code>NOTE_INSN_LOOP_CONT</code>
<dd>Appears at the place in a loop that <code>continue</code> statements jump to.

<br><dt><code>NOTE_INSN_LOOP_VTOP</code>
<dd>This note indicates the place in a loop where the exit test begins for
those loops in which the exit test has been duplicated.  This position
becomes another virtual start of the loop when considering loop
invariants.

<br><dt><code>NOTE_INSN_FUNCTION_END</code>
<dd>Appears near the end of the function body, just before the label that
<code>return</code> statements jump to (on machine where a single instruction
does not suffice for returning).  This note may be deleted by jump
optimization.

<br><dt><code>NOTE_INSN_SETJMP</code>
<dd>Appears following each call to <code>setjmp</code> or a related function. 
</dl>

<p>These codes are printed symbolically when they appear in debugging dumps. 
</dl>

<p>The machine mode of an insn is normally <code>VOIDmode</code>, but some
phases use the mode for various purposes.

<p>The common subexpression elimination pass sets the mode of an insn to
<code>QImode</code> when it is the first insn in a block that has already
been processed.

<p>The second Haifa scheduling pass, for targets that can multiple issue,
sets the mode of an insn to <code>TImode</code> when it is believed that the
instruction begins an issue group.  That is, when the instruction
cannot issue simultaneously with the previous.  This may be relied on
by later passes, in particular machine-dependant reorg.

<p>Here is a table of the extra fields of <code>insn</code>, <code>jump_insn</code>
and <code>call_insn</code> insns:

<dl>
<dt><code>PATTERN (<var>i</var>)</code>
<dd>An expression for the side effect performed by this insn.  This must be
one of the following codes: <code>set</code>, <code>call</code>, <code>use</code>,
<code>clobber</code>, <code>return</code>, <code>asm_input</code>, <code>asm_output</code>,
<code>addr_vec</code>, <code>addr_diff_vec</code>, <code>trap_if</code>, <code>unspec</code>,
<code>unspec_volatile</code>, <code>parallel</code>, or <code>sequence</code>.  If it is a <code>parallel</code>,
each element of the <code>parallel</code> must be one these codes, except that
<code>parallel</code> expressions cannot be nested and <code>addr_vec</code> and
<code>addr_diff_vec</code> are not permitted inside a <code>parallel</code> expression.

<br><dt><code>INSN_CODE (<var>i</var>)</code>
<dd>An integer that says which pattern in the machine description matches
this insn, or -1 if the matching has not yet been attempted.

<p>Such matching is never attempted and this field remains -1 on an insn
whose pattern consists of a single <code>use</code>, <code>clobber</code>,
<code>asm_input</code>, <code>addr_vec</code> or <code>addr_diff_vec</code> expression.

<p>Matching is also never attempted on insns that result from an <code>asm</code>
statement.  These contain at least one <code>asm_operands</code> expression. 
The function <code>asm_noperands</code> returns a non-negative value for
such insns.

<p>In the debugging output, this field is printed as a number followed by
a symbolic representation that locates the pattern in the <code>md</code>
file as some small positive or negative offset from a named pattern.

<br><dt><code>LOG_LINKS (<var>i</var>)</code>
<dd>A list (chain of <code>insn_list</code> expressions) giving information about
dependencies between instructions within a basic block.  Neither a jump
nor a label may come between the related insns.

<br><dt><code>REG_NOTES (<var>i</var>)</code>
<dd>A list (chain of <code>expr_list</code> and <code>insn_list</code> expressions)
giving miscellaneous information about the insn.  It is often
information pertaining to the registers used in this insn. 
</dl>

<p>The <code>LOG_LINKS</code> field of an insn is a chain of <code>insn_list</code>
expressions.  Each of these has two operands: the first is an insn,
and the second is another <code>insn_list</code> expression (the next one in
the chain).  The last <code>insn_list</code> in the chain has a null pointer
as second operand.  The significant thing about the chain is which
insns appear in it (as first operands of <code>insn_list</code>
expressions).  Their order is not significant.

<p>This list is originally set up by the flow analysis pass; it is a null
pointer until then.  Flow only adds links for those data dependencies
which can be used for instruction combination.  For each insn, the flow
analysis pass adds a link to insns which store into registers values
that are used for the first time in this insn.  The instruction
scheduling pass adds extra links so that every dependence will be
represented.  Links represent data dependencies, antidependencies and
output dependencies; the machine mode of the link distinguishes these
three types: antidependencies have mode <code>REG_DEP_ANTI</code>, output
dependencies have mode <code>REG_DEP_OUTPUT</code>, and data dependencies have
mode <code>VOIDmode</code>.

<p>The <code>REG_NOTES</code> field of an insn is a chain similar to the
<code>LOG_LINKS</code> field but it includes <code>expr_list</code> expressions in
addition to <code>insn_list</code> expressions.  There are several kinds of
register notes, which are distinguished by the machine mode, which in a
register note is really understood as being an <code>enum reg_note</code>. 
The first operand <var>op</var> of the note is data whose meaning depends on
the kind of note.

<p>The macro <code>REG_NOTE_KIND (<var>x</var>)</code> returns the kind of
register note.  Its counterpart, the macro <code>PUT_REG_NOTE_KIND
(<var>x</var>, <var>newkind</var>)</code> sets the register note type of <var>x</var> to be
<var>newkind</var>.

<p>Register notes are of three classes: They may say something about an
input to an insn, they may say something about an output of an insn, or
they may create a linkage between two insns.  There are also a set
of values that are only used in <code>LOG_LINKS</code>.

<p>These register notes annotate inputs to an insn:

<dl>
<dt><code>REG_DEAD</code>
<dd>The value in <var>op</var> dies in this insn; that is to say, altering the
value immediately after this insn would not affect the future behavior
of the program.

<p>This does not necessarily mean that the register <var>op</var> has no useful
value after this insn since it may also be an output of the insn.  In
such a case, however, a <code>REG_DEAD</code> note would be redundant and is
usually not present until after the reload pass, but no code relies on
this fact.

<br><dt><code>REG_INC</code>
<dd>The register <var>op</var> is incremented (or decremented; at this level
there is no distinction) by an embedded side effect inside this insn. 
This means it appears in a <code>post_inc</code>, <code>pre_inc</code>,
<code>post_dec</code> or <code>pre_dec</code> expression.

<br><dt><code>REG_NONNEG</code>
<dd>The register <var>op</var> is known to have a nonnegative value when this
insn is reached.  This is used so that decrement and branch until zero
instructions, such as the m68k dbra, can be matched.

<p>The <code>REG_NONNEG</code> note is added to insns only if the machine
description has a <code>decrement_and_branch_until_zero</code> pattern.

<br><dt><code>REG_NO_CONFLICT</code>
<dd>This insn does not cause a conflict between <var>op</var> and the item
being set by this insn even though it might appear that it does. 
In other words, if the destination register and <var>op</var> could
otherwise be assigned the same register, this insn does not
prevent that assignment.

<p>Insns with this note are usually part of a block that begins with a
<code>clobber</code> insn specifying a multi-word pseudo register (which will
be the output of the block), a group of insns that each set one word of
the value and have the <code>REG_NO_CONFLICT</code> note attached, and a final
insn that copies the output to itself with an attached <code>REG_EQUAL</code>
note giving the expression being computed.  This block is encapsulated
with <code>REG_LIBCALL</code> and <code>REG_RETVAL</code> notes on the first and
last insns, respectively.

<br><dt><code>REG_LABEL</code>
<dd>This insn uses <var>op</var>, a <code>code_label</code>, but is not a
<code>jump_insn</code>.  The presence of this note allows jump optimization to
be aware that <var>op</var> is, in fact, being used. 
</dl>

<p>The following notes describe attributes of outputs of an insn:

<dl>
<dt><code>REG_EQUIV</code>
<dt><code>REG_EQUAL</code>
<dd>This note is only valid on an insn that sets only one register and
indicates that that register will be equal to <var>op</var> at run time; the
scope of this equivalence differs between the two types of notes.  The
value which the insn explicitly copies into the register may look
different from <var>op</var>, but they will be equal at run time.  If the
output of the single <code>set</code> is a <code>strict_low_part</code> expression,
the note refers to the register that is contained in <code>SUBREG_REG</code>
of the <code>subreg</code> expression.

<p>For <code>REG_EQUIV</code>, the register is equivalent to <var>op</var> throughout
the entire function, and could validly be replaced in all its
occurrences by <var>op</var>.  ("Validly" here refers to the data flow of
the program; simple replacement may make some insns invalid.)  For
example, when a constant is loaded into a register that is never
assigned any other value, this kind of note is used.

<p>When a parameter is copied into a pseudo-register at entry to a function,
a note of this kind records that the register is equivalent to the stack
slot where the parameter was passed.  Although in this case the register
may be set by other insns, it is still valid to replace the register
by the stack slot throughout the function.

<p>A <code>REG_EQUIV</code> note is also used on an instruction which copies a
register parameter into a pseudo-register at entry to a function, if
there is a stack slot where that parameter could be stored.  Although
other insns may set the pseudo-register, it is valid for the compiler to
replace the pseudo-register by stack slot throughout the function,
provided the compiler ensures that the stack slot is properly
initialized by making the replacement in the initial copy instruction as
well.  This is used on machines for which the calling convention
allocates stack space for register parameters.  See
<code>REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE</code> in <a href="#Stack%20Arguments">Stack Arguments</a>.

<p>In the case of <code>REG_EQUAL</code>, the register that is set by this insn
will be equal to <var>op</var> at run time at the end of this insn but not
necessarily elsewhere in the function.  In this case, <var>op</var>
is typically an arithmetic expression.  For example, when a sequence of
insns such as a library call is used to perform an arithmetic operation,
this kind of note is attached to the insn that produces or copies the
final value.

<p>These two notes are used in different ways by the compiler passes. 
<code>REG_EQUAL</code> is used by passes prior to register allocation (such as
common subexpression elimination and loop optimization) to tell them how
to think of that value.  <code>REG_EQUIV</code> notes are used by register
allocation to indicate that there is an available substitute expression
(either a constant or a <code>mem</code> expression for the location of a
parameter on the stack) that may be used in place of a register if
insufficient registers are available.

<p>Except for stack homes for parameters, which are indicated by a
<code>REG_EQUIV</code> note and are not useful to the early optimization
passes and pseudo registers that are equivalent to a memory location
throughout there entire life, which is not detected until later in
the compilation, all equivalences are initially indicated by an attached
<code>REG_EQUAL</code> note.  In the early stages of register allocation, a
<code>REG_EQUAL</code> note is changed into a <code>REG_EQUIV</code> note if
<var>op</var> is a constant and the insn represents the only set of its
destination register.

<p>Thus, compiler passes prior to register allocation need only check for
<code>REG_EQUAL</code> notes and passes subsequent to register allocation
need only check for <code>REG_EQUIV</code> notes.

<br><dt><code>REG_UNUSED</code>
<dd>The register <var>op</var> being set by this insn will not be used in a
subsequent insn.  This differs from a <code>REG_DEAD</code> note, which
indicates that the value in an input will not be used subsequently. 
These two notes are independent; both may be present for the same
register.

<br><dt><code>REG_WAS_0</code>
<dd>The single output of this insn contained zero before this insn. 
<var>op</var> is the insn that set it to zero.  You can rely on this note if
it is present and <var>op</var> has not been deleted or turned into a <code>note</code>;

<p>These notes describe linkages between insns.  They occur in pairs: one
insn has one of a pair of notes that points to a second insn, which has
the inverse note pointing back to the first insn.

<dl>
<dt><code>REG_RETVAL</code>
<dd>This insn copies the value of a multi-insn sequence (for example, a
library call), and <var>op</var> is the first insn of the sequence (for a
library call, the first insn that was generated to set up the arguments
for the library call).

<p>Loop optimization uses this note to treat such a sequence as a single
operation for code motion purposes and flow analysis uses this note to
delete such sequences whose results are dead.

<p>A <code>REG_EQUAL</code> note will also usually be attached to this insn to
provide the expression being computed by the sequence.

<p>These notes will be deleted after reload, since they are no longer
accurate or useful.

<br><dt><code>REG_LIBCALL</code>
<dd>This is the inverse of <code>REG_RETVAL</code>: it is placed on the first
insn of a multi-insn sequence, and it points to the last one.

<p>These notes are deleted after reload, since they are no longer useful or
accurate.

<br><dt><code>REG_CC_SETTER</code>
<dt><code>REG_CC_USER</code>
<dd>On machines that use <code>cc0</code>, the insns which set and use <code>cc0</code>
set and use <code>cc0</code> are adjacent.  However, when branch delay slot
filling is done, this may no longer be true.  In this case a
<code>REG_CC_USER</code> note will be placed on the insn setting <code>cc0</code> to
point to the insn using <code>cc0</code> and a <code>REG_CC_SETTER</code> note will
be placed on the insn using <code>cc0</code> to point to the insn setting
<code>cc0</code>. 
</dl>

<p>These values are only used in the <code>LOG_LINKS</code> field, and indicate
the type of dependency that each link represents.  Links which indicate
a data dependence (a read after write dependence) do not use any code,
they simply have mode <code>VOIDmode</code>, and are printed without any
descriptive text.

<dl>
<dt><code>REG_DEP_ANTI</code>
<dd>This indicates an anti dependence (a write after read dependence).

<br><dt><code>REG_DEP_OUTPUT</code>
<dd>This indicates an output dependence (a write after write dependence).

<p>These notes describe information gathered from gcov profile data.  They
are stored in the <code>REG_NOTES</code> field of an insn as an
<code>expr_list</code>.

<dl>
<dt><code>REG_EXEC_COUNT</code>
<dd>This is used to indicate the number of times a basic block was executed
according to the profile data.  The note is attached to the first insn in
the basic block.

<br><dt><code>REG_BR_PROB</code>
<dd>This is used to specify the ratio of branches to non-branches of a
branch insn according to the profile data.  The value is stored as a
value between 0 and REG_BR_PROB_BASE; larger values indicate a higher
probability that the branch will be taken.

<br><dt><code>REG_BR_PRED</code>
<dd>These notes are found in JUMP insns after delayed branch scheduling
has taken place.  They indicate both the direction and the likelyhood
of the JUMP.  The format is a bitmask of ATTR_FLAG_* values.

<br><dt><code>REG_FRAME_RELATED_EXPR</code>
<dd>This is used on an RTX_FRAME_RELATED_P insn wherein the attached expression
is used in place of the actual insn pattern.  This is done in cases where
the pattern is either complex or misleading. 
</dl>

<p>For convenience, the machine mode in an <code>insn_list</code> or
<code>expr_list</code> is printed using these symbolic codes in debugging dumps.

<p>The only difference between the expression codes <code>insn_list</code> and
<code>expr_list</code> is that the first operand of an <code>insn_list</code> is
assumed to be an insn and is printed in debugging dumps as the insn's
unique id; the first operand of an <code>expr_list</code> is printed in the
ordinary way as an expression.

<h2>RTL Representation of Function-Call Insns</h2>

<p>Insns that call subroutines have the RTL expression code <code>call_insn</code>. 
These insns must satisfy special rules, and their bodies must use a special
RTL expression code, <code>call</code>.

<p>A <code>call</code> expression has two operands, as follows:

<pre>(call (mem:<var>fm</var> <var>addr</var>) <var>nbytes</var>)
</pre>

<p>Here <var>nbytes</var> is an operand that represents the number of bytes of
argument data being passed to the subroutine, <var>fm</var> is a machine mode
(which must equal as the definition of the <code>FUNCTION_MODE</code> macro in
the machine description) and <var>addr</var> represents the address of the
subroutine.

<p>For a subroutine that returns no value, the <code>call</code> expression as
shown above is the entire body of the insn, except that the insn might
also contain <code>use</code> or <code>clobber</code> expressions.

<p>For a subroutine that returns a value whose mode is not <code>BLKmode</code>,
the value is returned in a hard register.  If this register's number is
<var>r</var>, then the body of the call insn looks like this:

<pre>(set (reg:<var>m</var> <var>r</var>)
     (call (mem:<var>fm</var> <var>addr</var>) <var>nbytes</var>))
</pre>

<p>This RTL expression makes it clear (to the optimizer passes) that the
appropriate register receives a useful value in this insn.

<p>When a subroutine returns a <code>BLKmode</code> value, it is handled by
passing to the subroutine the address of a place to store the value. 
So the call insn itself does not "return" any value, and it has the
same RTL form as a call that returns nothing.

<p>On some machines, the call instruction itself clobbers some register,
for example to contain the return address.  <code>call_insn</code> insns
on these machines should have a body which is a <code>parallel</code>
that contains both the <code>call</code> expression and <code>clobber</code>
expressions that indicate which registers are destroyed.  Similarly,
if the call instruction requires some register other than the stack
pointer that is not explicitly mentioned it its RTL, a <code>use</code>
subexpression should mention that register.

<p>Functions that are called are assumed to modify all registers listed in
the configuration macro <code>CALL_USED_REGISTERS</code> (see <a href="#Register%20Basics">Register Basics</a>) and, with the exception of <code>const</code> functions and library
calls, to modify all of memory.

<p>Insns containing just <code>use</code> expressions directly precede the
<code>call_insn</code> insn to indicate which registers contain inputs to the
function.  Similarly, if registers other than those in
<code>CALL_USED_REGISTERS</code> are clobbered by the called function, insns
containing a single <code>clobber</code> follow immediately after the call to
indicate which registers.

<h2>Structure Sharing Assumptions</h2>

<p>The compiler assumes that certain kinds of RTL expressions are unique;
there do not exist two distinct objects representing the same value. 
In other cases, it makes an opposite assumption: that no RTL expression
object of a certain kind appears in more than one place in the
containing structure.

<p>These assumptions refer to a single function; except for the RTL
objects that describe global variables and external functions,
and a few standard objects such as small integer constants,
no RTL objects are common to two functions.

<ul>
<li>Each pseudo-register has only a single <code>reg</code> object to represent it,
and therefore only a single machine mode.

<li>For any symbolic label, there is only one <code>symbol_ref</code> object
referring to it.

<li>There is only one <code>const_int</code> expression with value 0, only
one with value 1, and only one with value -1. 
Some other integer values are also stored uniquely.

<li>There is only one <code>pc</code> expression.

<li>There is only one <code>cc0</code> expression.

<li>There is only one <code>const_double</code> expression with value 0 for
each floating point mode.  Likewise for values 1 and 2.

<li>No <code>label_ref</code> or <code>scratch</code> appears in more than one place in
the RTL structure; in other words, it is safe to do a tree-walk of all
the insns in the function and assume that each time a <code>label_ref</code>
or <code>scratch</code> is seen it is distinct from all others that are seen.

<li>Only one <code>mem</code> object is normally created for each static
variable or stack slot, so these objects are frequently shared in all
the places they appear.  However, separate but equal objects for these
variables are occasionally made.

<li>When a single <code>asm</code> statement has multiple output operands, a
distinct <code>asm_operands</code> expression is made for each output operand. 
However, these all share the vector which contains the sequence of input
operands.  This sharing is used later on to test whether two
<code>asm_operands</code> expressions come from the same statement, so all
optimizations must carefully preserve the sharing if they copy the
vector at all.

<li>No RTL object appears in more than one place in the RTL structure
except as described above.  Many passes of the compiler rely on this
by assuming that they can modify RTL objects in place without unwanted
side-effects on other insns.

<li>During initial RTL generation, shared structure is freely introduced. 
After all the RTL for a function has been generated, all shared
structure is copied by <code>unshare_all_rtl</code> in <code>emit-rtl.c</code>,
after which the above rules are guaranteed to be followed.

<li>During the combiner pass, shared structure within an insn can exist
temporarily.  However, the shared structure is copied before the
combiner is finished with the insn.  This is done by calling
<code>copy_rtx_if_shared</code>, which is a subroutine of
<code>unshare_all_rtl</code>.

<h2>Reading RTL</h2>

<p>To read an RTL object from a file, call <code>read_rtx</code>.  It takes one
argument, a stdio stream, and returns a single RTL object.

<p>Reading RTL from a file is very slow.  This is not currently a
problem since reading RTL occurs only as part of building the
compiler.

<p>People frequently have the idea of using RTL stored as text in a file as
an interface between a language front end and the bulk of GNU CC.  This
idea is not feasible.

<p>GNU CC was designed to use RTL internally only.  Correct RTL for a given
program is very dependent on the particular target machine.  And the RTL
does not contain all the information about the program.

<p>The proper way to interface GNU CC to a new language front end is with
the "tree" data structure.  There is no manual for this data
structure, but it is described in the files <code>tree.h</code> and
<code>tree.def</code>.

<h1>Machine Descriptions</h1>

<p>A machine description has two parts: a file of instruction patterns
(<code>.md</code> file) and a C header file of macro definitions.

<p>The <code>.md</code> file for a target machine contains a pattern for each
instruction that the target machine supports (or at least each instruction
that is worth telling the compiler about).  It may also contain comments. 
A semicolon causes the rest of the line to be a comment, unless the semicolon
is inside a quoted string.

<h2>Everything about Instruction Patterns</h2>

<p>Each instruction pattern contains an incomplete RTL expression, with pieces
to be filled in later, operand constraints that restrict how the pieces can
be filled in, and an output pattern or C code to generate the assembler
output, all wrapped up in a <code>define_insn</code> expression.

<p>A <code>define_insn</code> is an RTL expression containing four or five operands:

<ol type=1 start=1>
</p><li>An optional name.  The presence of a name indicate that this instruction
pattern can perform a certain standard job for the RTL-generation
pass of the compiler.  This pass knows certain names and will use
the instruction patterns with those names, if the names are defined
in the machine description.

<p>The absence of a name is indicated by writing an empty string
where the name should go.  Nameless instruction patterns are never
used for generating RTL code, but they may permit several simpler insns
to be combined later on.

<p>Names that are not thus known and used in RTL-generation have no
effect; they are equivalent to no name at all.

</p><li>The <dfn>RTL template</dfn> (see <a href="#RTL%20Template">RTL Template</a>) is a vector of incomplete
RTL expressions which show what the instruction should look like.  It is
incomplete because it may contain <code>match_operand</code>,
<code>match_operator</code>, and <code>match_dup</code> expressions that stand for
operands of the instruction.

<p>If the vector has only one element, that element is the template for the
instruction pattern.  If the vector has multiple elements, then the
instruction pattern is a <code>parallel</code> expression containing the
elements described.

</p><li>A condition.  This is a string which contains a C expression that is
the final test to decide whether an insn body matches this pattern.

<p>For a named pattern, the condition (if present) may not depend on
the data in the insn being matched, but only the target-machine-type
flags.  The compiler needs to test these conditions during
initialization in order to learn exactly which named instructions are
available in a particular run.

<p>For nameless patterns, the condition is applied only when matching an
individual insn, and only after the insn has matched the pattern's
recognition template.  The insn's operands may be found in the vector
<code>operands</code>.

</p><li>The <dfn>output template</dfn>: a string that says how to output matching
insns as assembler code.  <code>%</code> in this string specifies where
to substitute the value of an operand.  See <a href="#Output%20Template">Output Template</a>.

<p>When simple substitution isn't general enough, you can specify a piece
of C code to compute the output.  See <a href="#Output%20Statement">Output Statement</a>.

</p><li>Optionally, a vector containing the values of attributes for insns matching
this pattern.  See <a href="#Insn%20Attributes">Insn Attributes</a>.
</ol>

<h2>Example of <code>define_insn</code></h2>

<p>Here is an actual example of an instruction pattern, for the 68000/68020.

<pre>(define_insn "tstsi"
  [(set (cc0)
        (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "rm"))]
  ""
  "*
{ if (TARGET_68020 || ! ADDRESS_REG_P (operands[0]))
    return \"tstl %0\";
  return \"cmpl #0,%0\"; }")
</pre>

<p>This is an instruction that sets the condition codes based on the value of
a general operand.  It has no condition, so any insn whose RTL description
has the form shown may be handled according to this pattern.  The name
<code>tstsi</code> means "test a <code>SImode</code> value" and tells the RTL generation
pass that, when it is necessary to test such a value, an insn to do so
can be constructed using this pattern.

<p>The output control string is a piece of C code which chooses which
output template to return based on the kind of operand and the specific
type of CPU for which code is being generated.

<p><code>"rm"</code> is an operand constraint.  Its meaning is explained below.

<h2>RTL Template</h2>

<p>The RTL template is used to define which insns match the particular pattern
and how to find their operands.  For named patterns, the RTL template also
says how to construct an insn from specified operands.

<p>Construction involves substituting specified operands into a copy of the
template.  Matching involves determining the values that serve as the
operands in the insn being matched.  Both of these activities are
controlled by special expression types that direct matching and
substitution of the operands.

<dl>
<dt><code>(match_operand:<var>m</var> <var>n</var> <var>predicate</var> <var>constraint</var>)</code>
<dd>This expression is a placeholder for operand number <var>n</var> of
the insn.  When constructing an insn, operand number <var>n</var>
will be substituted at this point.  When matching an insn, whatever
appears at this position in the insn will be taken as operand
number <var>n</var>; but it must satisfy <var>predicate</var> or this instruction
pattern will not match at all.

<p>Operand numbers must be chosen consecutively counting from zero in
each instruction pattern.  There may be only one <code>match_operand</code>
expression in the pattern for each operand number.  Usually operands
are numbered in the order of appearance in <code>match_operand</code>
expressions.  In the case of a <code>define_expand</code>, any operand numbers
used only in <code>match_dup</code> expressions have higher values than all
other operand numbers.

<p><var>predicate</var> is a string that is the name of a C function that accepts two
arguments, an expression and a machine mode.  During matching, the
function will be called with the putative operand as the expression and
<var>m</var> as the mode argument (if <var>m</var> is not specified,
<code>VOIDmode</code> will be used, which normally causes <var>predicate</var> to accept
any mode).  If it returns zero, this instruction pattern fails to match. 
<var>predicate</var> may be an empty string; then it means no test is to be done
on the operand, so anything which occurs in this position is valid.

<p>Most of the time, <var>predicate</var> will reject modes other than <var>m</var>--but
not always.  For example, the predicate <code>address_operand</code> uses
<var>m</var> as the mode of memory ref that the address should be valid for. 
Many predicates accept <code>const_int</code> nodes even though their mode is
<code>VOIDmode</code>.

<p><var>constraint</var> controls reloading and the choice of the best register
class to use for a value, as explained later (see <a href="#Constraints">Constraints</a>).

<p>People are often unclear on the difference between the constraint and the
predicate.  The predicate helps decide whether a given insn matches the
pattern.  The constraint plays no role in this decision; instead, it
controls various decisions in the case of an insn which does match.

<p>On CISC machines, the most common <var>predicate</var> is
<code>"general_operand"</code>.  This function checks that the putative
operand is either a constant, a register or a memory reference, and that
it is valid for mode <var>m</var>.

<p>For an operand that must be a register, <var>predicate</var> should be
<code>"register_operand"</code>.  Using <code>"general_operand"</code> would be
valid, since the reload pass would copy any non-register operands
through registers, but this would make GNU CC do extra work, it would
prevent invariant operands (such as constant) from being removed from
loops, and it would prevent the register allocator from doing the best
possible job.  On RISC machines, it is usually most efficient to allow
<var>predicate</var> to accept only objects that the constraints allow.

<p>For an operand that must be a constant, you must be sure to either use
<code>"immediate_operand"</code> for <var>predicate</var>, or make the instruction
pattern's extra condition require a constant, or both.  You cannot
expect the constraints to do this work!  If the constraints allow only
constants, but the predicate allows something else, the compiler will
crash when that case arises.

<br><dt><code>(match_scratch:<var>m</var> <var>n</var> <var>constraint</var>)</code>
<dd>This expression is also a placeholder for operand number <var>n</var>
and indicates that operand must be a <code>scratch</code> or <code>reg</code>
expression.

<p>When matching patterns, this is equivalent to

<pre>(match_operand:<var>m</var> <var>n</var> "scratch_operand" <var>pred</var>)
</pre>

<p>but, when generating RTL, it produces a (<code>scratch</code>:<var>m</var>)
expression.

<p>If the last few expressions in a <code>parallel</code> are <code>clobber</code>
expressions whose operands are either a hard register or
<code>match_scratch</code>, the combiner can add or delete them when
necessary.  See <a href="#Side%20Effects">Side Effects</a>.

<br><dt><code>(match_dup <var>n</var>)</code>
<dd>This expression is also a placeholder for operand number <var>n</var>. 
It is used when the operand needs to appear more than once in the
insn.

<p>In construction, <code>match_dup</code> acts just like <code>match_operand</code>:
the operand is substituted into the insn being constructed.  But in
matching, <code>match_dup</code> behaves differently.  It assumes that operand
number <var>n</var> has already been determined by a <code>match_operand</code>
appearing earlier in the recognition template, and it matches only an
identical-looking expression.

<br><dt><code>(match_operator:<var>m</var> <var>n</var> <var>predicate</var> [<var>operands</var><small>...</small>])</code>
<dd>This pattern is a kind of placeholder for a variable RTL expression
code.

<p>When constructing an insn, it stands for an RTL expression whose
expression code is taken from that of operand <var>n</var>, and whose
operands are constructed from the patterns <var>operands</var>.

<p>When matching an expression, it matches an expression if the function
<var>predicate</var> returns nonzero on that expression <em>and</em> the
patterns <var>operands</var> match the operands of the expression.

<p>Suppose that the function <code>commutative_operator</code> is defined as
follows, to match any expression whose operator is one of the
commutative arithmetic operators of RTL and whose mode is <var>mode</var>:

<pre>int
commutative_operator (x, mode)
     rtx x;
     enum machine_mode mode;
{
  enum rtx_code code = GET_CODE (x);
  if (GET_MODE (x) != mode)
    return 0;
  return (GET_RTX_CLASS (code) == 'c'
          || code == EQ || code == NE);
}
</pre>

<p>Then the following pattern will match any RTL expression consisting
of a commutative operator applied to two general operands:

<pre>(match_operator:SI 3 "commutative_operator"
  [(match_operand:SI 1 "general_operand" "g")
   (match_operand:SI 2 "general_operand" "g")])
</pre>

<p>Here the vector <code>[<var>operands</var><small>...</small>]</code> contains two patterns
because the expressions to be matched all contain two operands.

<p>When this pattern does match, the two operands of the commutative
operator are recorded as operands 1 and 2 of the insn.  (This is done
by the two instances of <code>match_operand</code>.)  Operand 3 of the insn
will be the entire commutative expression: use <code>GET_CODE
(operands[3])</code> to see which commutative operator was used.

<p>The machine mode <var>m</var> of <code>match_operator</code> works like that of
<code>match_operand</code>: it is passed as the second argument to the
predicate function, and that function is solely responsible for
deciding whether the expression to be matched "has" that mode.

<p>When constructing an insn, argument 3 of the gen-function will specify
the operation (i.e. the expression code) for the expression to be
made.  It should be an RTL expression, whose expression code is copied
into a new expression whose operands are arguments 1 and 2 of the
gen-function.  The subexpressions of argument 3 are not used;
only its expression code matters.

<p>When <code>match_operator</code> is used in a pattern for matching an insn,
it usually best if the operand number of the <code>match_operator</code>
is higher than that of the actual operands of the insn.  This improves
register allocation because the register allocator often looks at
operands 1 and 2 of insns to see if it can do register tying.

<p>There is no way to specify constraints in <code>match_operator</code>.  The
operand of the insn which corresponds to the <code>match_operator</code>
never has any constraints because it is never reloaded as a whole. 
However, if parts of its <var>operands</var> are matched by
<code>match_operand</code> patterns, those parts may have constraints of
their own.

<br><dt><code>(match_op_dup:<var>m</var> <var>n</var>[<var>operands</var><small>...</small>])</code>
<dd>Like <code>match_dup</code>, except that it applies to operators instead of
operands.  When constructing an insn, operand number <var>n</var> will be
substituted at this point.  But in matching, <code>match_op_dup</code> behaves
differently.  It assumes that operand number <var>n</var> has already been
determined by a <code>match_operator</code> appearing earlier in the
recognition template, and it matches only an identical-looking
expression.

<br><dt><code>(match_parallel <var>n</var> <var>predicate</var> [<var>subpat</var><small>...</small>])</code>
<dd>This pattern is a placeholder for an insn that consists of a
<code>parallel</code> expression with a variable number of elements.  This
expression should only appear at the top level of an insn pattern.

<p>When constructing an insn, operand number <var>n</var> will be substituted at
this point.  When matching an insn, it matches if the body of the insn
is a <code>parallel</code> expression with at least as many elements as the
vector of <var>subpat</var> expressions in the <code>match_parallel</code>, if each
<var>subpat</var> matches the corresponding element of the <code>parallel</code>,
<em>and</em> the function <var>predicate</var> returns nonzero on the
<code>parallel</code> that is the body of the insn.  It is the responsibility
of the predicate to validate elements of the <code>parallel</code> beyond
those listed in the <code>match_parallel</code>.

<p>A typical use of <code>match_parallel</code> is to match load and store
multiple expressions, which can contain a variable number of elements
in a <code>parallel</code>.  For example,

<pre>(define_insn ""
  [(match_parallel 0 "load_multiple_operation"
     [(set (match_operand:SI 1 "gpc_reg_operand" "=r")
           (match_operand:SI 2 "memory_operand" "m"))
      (use (reg:SI 179))
      (clobber (reg:SI 179))])]
  ""
  "loadm 0,0,%1,%2")
</pre>

<p>This example comes from <code>a29k.md</code>.  The function
<code>load_multiple_operations</code> is defined in <code>a29k.c</code> and checks
that subsequent elements in the <code>parallel</code> are the same as the
<code>set</code> in the pattern, except that they are referencing subsequent
registers and memory locations.

<p>An insn that matches this pattern might look like:

<pre>(parallel
 [(set (reg:SI 20) (mem:SI (reg:SI 100)))
  (use (reg:SI 179))
  (clobber (reg:SI 179))
  (set (reg:SI 21)
       (mem:SI (plus:SI (reg:SI 100)
                        (const_int 4))))
  (set (reg:SI 22)
       (mem:SI (plus:SI (reg:SI 100)
                        (const_int 8))))])
</pre>

<br><dt><code>(match_par_dup <var>n</var> [<var>subpat</var><small>...</small>])</code>
<dd>Like <code>match_op_dup</code>, but for <code>match_parallel</code> instead of
<code>match_operator</code>.

<br><dt><code>(match_insn <var>predicate</var>)</code>
<dd>Match a complete insn.  Unlike the other <code>match_*</code> recognizers,
<code>match_insn</code> does not take an operand number.

<p>The machine mode <var>m</var> of <code>match_insn</code> works like that of
<code>match_operand</code>: it is passed as the second argument to the
predicate function, and that function is solely responsible for
deciding whether the expression to be matched "has" that mode.

<br><dt><code>(match_insn2 <var>n</var> <var>predicate</var>)</code>
<dd>Match a complete insn.

<p>The machine mode <var>m</var> of <code>match_insn2</code> works like that of
<code>match_operand</code>: it is passed as the second argument to the
predicate function, and that function is solely responsible for
deciding whether the expression to be matched "has" that mode.

<br><dt><code>(address (match_operand:<var>m</var> <var>n</var> "address_operand" ""))</code>
<dd>This complex of expressions is a placeholder for an operand number
<var>n</var> in a "load address" instruction: an operand which specifies
a memory location in the usual way, but for which the actual operand
value used is the address of the location, not the contents of the
location.

<p><code>address</code> expressions never appear in RTL code, only in machine
descriptions.  And they are used only in machine descriptions that do
not use the operand constraint feature.  When operand constraints are
in use, the letter <code>p</code> in the constraint serves this purpose.

<p><var>m</var> is the machine mode of the <em>memory location being
addressed</em>, not the machine mode of the address itself.  That mode is
always the same on a given target machine (it is <code>Pmode</code>, which
normally is <code>SImode</code>), so there is no point in mentioning it;
thus, no machine mode is written in the <code>address</code> expression.  If
some day support is added for machines in which addresses of different
kinds of objects appear differently or are used differently (such as
the PDP-10), different formats would perhaps need different machine
modes and these modes might be written in the <code>address</code>
expression.

<h2>Output Templates and Operand Substitution</h2>

<p>The <dfn>output template</dfn> is a string which specifies how to output the
assembler code for an instruction pattern.  Most of the template is a
fixed string which is output literally.  The character <code>%</code> is used
to specify where to substitute an operand; it can also be used to
identify places where different variants of the assembler require
different syntax.

<p>In the simplest case, a <code>%</code> followed by a digit <var>n</var> says to output
operand <var>n</var> at that point in the string.

<p><code>%</code> followed by a letter and a digit says to output an operand in an
alternate fashion.  Four letters have standard, built-in meanings described
below.  The machine description macro <code>PRINT_OPERAND</code> can define
additional letters with nonstandard meanings.

<p><code>%c<var>digit</var></code> can be used to substitute an operand that is a
constant value without the syntax that normally indicates an immediate
operand.

<p><code>%n<var>digit</var></code> is like <code>%c<var>digit</var></code> except that the value of
the constant is negated before printing.

<p><code>%a<var>digit</var></code> can be used to substitute an operand as if it were a
memory reference, with the actual operand treated as the address.  This may
be useful when outputting a "load address" instruction, because often the
assembler syntax for such an instruction requires you to write the operand
as if it were a memory reference.

<p><code>%l<var>digit</var></code> is used to substitute a <code>label_ref</code> into a jump
instruction.

<p><code>%=</code> outputs a number which is unique to each instruction in the
entire compilation.  This is useful for making local labels to be
referred to more than once in a single template that generates multiple
assembler instructions.

<p><code>%</code> followed by a punctuation character specifies a substitution that
does not use an operand.  Only one case is standard: <code>%%</code> outputs a
<code>%</code> into the assembler code.  Other nonstandard cases can be
defined in the <code>PRINT_OPERAND</code> macro.  You must also define
which punctuation characters are valid with the
<code>PRINT_OPERAND_PUNCT_VALID_P</code> macro.

<p>The template may generate multiple assembler instructions.  Write the text
for the instructions, with <code>\;</code> between them.

<p>When the RTL contains two operands which are required by constraint to match
each other, the output template must refer only to the lower-numbered operand. 
Matching operands are not always identical, and the rest of the compiler
arranges to put the proper RTL expression for printing into the lower-numbered
operand.

<p>One use of nonstandard letters or punctuation following <code>%</code> is to
distinguish between different assembler languages for the same machine; for
example, Motorola syntax versus MIT syntax for the 68000.  Motorola syntax
requires periods in most opcode names, while MIT syntax does not.  For
example, the opcode <code>movel</code> in MIT syntax is <code>move.l</code> in Motorola
syntax.  The same file of patterns is used for both kinds of output syntax,
but the character sequence <code>%.</code> is used in each place where Motorola
syntax wants a period.  The <code>PRINT_OPERAND</code> macro for Motorola syntax
defines the sequence to output a period; the macro for MIT syntax defines
it to do nothing.

<p>As a special case, a template consisting of the single character <code>#</code>
instructs the compiler to first split the insn, and then output the
resulting instructions separately.  This helps eliminate redundancy in the
output templates.   If you have a <code>define_insn</code> that needs to emit
multiple assembler instructions, and there is an matching <code>define_split</code>
already defined, then you can simply use <code>#</code> as the output template
instead of writing an output template that emits the multiple assembler
instructions.

<p>If the macro <code>ASSEMBLER_DIALECT</code> is defined, you can use construct
of the form <code>{option0|option1|option2}</code> in the templates.  These
describe multiple variants of assembler language syntax.

<h2>C Statements for Assembler Output</h2>

<p>Often a single fixed template string cannot produce correct and efficient
assembler code for all the cases that are recognized by a single
instruction pattern.  For example, the opcodes may depend on the kinds of
operands; or some unfortunate combinations of operands may require extra
machine instructions.

<p>If the output control string starts with a <code>@</code>, then it is actually
a series of templates, each on a separate line.  (Blank lines and
leading spaces and tabs are ignored.)  The templates correspond to the
pattern's constraint alternatives (see <a href="#Multi-Alternative">Multi-Alternative</a>).  For example,
if a target machine has a two-address add instruction <code>addr</code> to add
into a register and another <code>addm</code> to add a register to memory, you
might write this pattern:

<pre>(define_insn "addsi3"
  [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "=r,m")
        (plus:SI (match_operand:SI 1 "general_operand" "0,0")
                 (match_operand:SI 2 "general_operand" "g,r")))]
  ""
  "@
   addr %2,%0
   addm %2,%0")
</pre>

<p>If the output control string starts with a <code>*</code>, then it is not an
output template but rather a piece of C program that should compute a
template.  It should execute a <code>return</code> statement to return the
template-string you want.  Most such templates use C string literals, which
require doublequote characters to delimit them.  To include these
doublequote characters in the string, prefix each one with <code>\</code>.

<p>The operands may be found in the array <code>operands</code>, whose C data type
is <code>rtx []</code>.

<p>It is very common to select different ways of generating assembler code
based on whether an immediate operand is within a certain range.  Be
careful when doing this, because the result of <code>INTVAL</code> is an
integer on the host machine.  If the host machine has more bits in an
<code>int</code> than the target machine has in the mode in which the constant
will be used, then some of the bits you get from <code>INTVAL</code> will be
superfluous.  For proper results, you must carefully disregard the
values of those bits.

<p>It is possible to output an assembler instruction and then go on to output
or compute more of them, using the subroutine <code>output_asm_insn</code>.  This
receives two arguments: a template-string and a vector of operands.  The
vector may be <code>operands</code>, or it may be another array of <code>rtx</code>
that you declare locally and initialize yourself.

<p>When an insn pattern has multiple alternatives in its constraints, often
the appearance of the assembler code is determined mostly by which alternative
was matched.  When this is so, the C code can test the variable
<code>which_alternative</code>, which is the ordinal number of the alternative
that was actually satisfied (0 for the first, 1 for the second alternative,
etc.).

<p>For example, suppose there are two opcodes for storing zero, <code>clrreg</code>
for registers and <code>clrmem</code> for memory locations.  Here is how
a pattern could use <code>which_alternative</code> to choose between them:

<pre>(define_insn ""
  [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "=r,m")
        (const_int 0))]
  ""
  "*
  return (which_alternative == 0
          ? \"clrreg %0\" : \"clrmem %0\");
  ")
</pre>

<p>The example above, where the assembler code to generate was
<em>solely</em> determined by the alternative, could also have been specified
as follows, having the output control string start with a <code>@</code>:

<pre>(define_insn ""
  [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "=r,m")
        (const_int 0))]
  ""
  "@
   clrreg %0
   clrmem %0")
</pre>

<h2>Operand Constraints</h2>

<p>Each <code>match_operand</code> in an instruction pattern can specify a
constraint for the type of operands allowed. 
Constraints can say whether
an operand may be in a register, and which kinds of register; whether the
operand can be a memory reference, and which kinds of address; whether the
operand may be an immediate constant, and which possible values it may
have.  Constraints can also require two operands to match.

<br>

<h3>Simple Constraints</h3>

<p>The simplest kind of constraint is a string full of letters, each of
which describes one kind of operand that is permitted.  Here are
the letters that are allowed:

<dl>
<dt><code>m</code>
<dd>A memory operand is allowed, with any kind of address that the machine
supports in general.

<br><dt><code>o</code>
<dd>A memory operand is allowed, but only if the address is
<dfn>offsettable</dfn>.  This means that adding a small integer (actually,
the width in bytes of the operand, as determined by its machine mode)
may be added to the address and the result is also a valid memory
address.

<p>For example, an address which is constant is offsettable; so is an
address that is the sum of a register and a constant (as long as a
slightly larger constant is also within the range of address-offsets
supported by the machine); but an autoincrement or autodecrement
address is not offsettable.  More complicated indirect/indexed
addresses may or may not be offsettable depending on the other
addressing modes that the machine supports.

<p>Note that in an output operand which can be matched by another
operand, the constraint letter <code>o</code> is valid only when accompanied
by both <code>&lt;</code> (if the target machine has predecrement addressing)
and <code>&gt;</code> (if the target machine has preincrement addressing).

<br><dt><code>V</code>
<dd>A memory operand that is not offsettable.  In other words, anything that
would fit the <code>m</code> constraint but not the <code>o</code> constraint.

<br><dt><code>&lt;</code>
<dd>A memory operand with autodecrement addressing (either predecrement or
postdecrement) is allowed.

<br><dt><code>&gt;</code>
<dd>A memory operand with autoincrement addressing (either preincrement or
postincrement) is allowed.

<br><dt><code>r</code>
<dd>A register operand is allowed provided that it is in a general
register.

<br><dt><code>d</code>, <code>a</code>, <code>f</code>, <small>...</small>
<dd>Other letters can be defined in machine-dependent fashion to stand for
particular classes of registers.  <code>d</code>, <code>a</code> and <code>f</code> are
defined on the 68000/68020 to stand for data, address and floating
point registers.

<br><dt><code>i</code>
<dd>An immediate integer operand (one with constant value) is allowed. 
This includes symbolic constants whose values will be known only at
assembly time.

<br><dt><code>n</code>
<dd>An immediate integer operand with a known numeric value is allowed. 
Many systems cannot support assembly-time constants for operands less
than a word wide.  Constraints for these operands should use <code>n</code>
rather than <code>i</code>.

<br><dt><code>I</code>, <code>J</code>, <code>K</code>, <small>...</small> <code>P</code>
<dd>Other letters in the range <code>I</code> through <code>P</code> may be defined in
a machine-dependent fashion to permit immediate integer operands with
explicit integer values in specified ranges.  For example, on the
68000, <code>I</code> is defined to stand for the range of values 1 to 8. 
This is the range permitted as a shift count in the shift
instructions.

<br><dt><code>E</code>
<dd>An immediate floating operand (expression code <code>const_double</code>) is
allowed, but only if the target floating point format is the same as
that of the host machine (on which the compiler is running).

<br><dt><code>F</code>
<dd>An immediate floating operand (expression code <code>const_double</code>) is
allowed.

<br><dt><code>G</code>, <code>H</code>
<dd><code>G</code> and <code>H</code> may be defined in a machine-dependent fashion to
permit immediate floating operands in particular ranges of values.

<br><dt><code>s</code>
<dd>An immediate integer operand whose value is not an explicit integer is
allowed.

<p>This might appear strange; if an insn allows a constant operand with a
value not known at compile time, it certainly must allow any known
value.  So why use <code>s</code> instead of <code>i</code>?  Sometimes it allows
better code to be generated.

<p>For example, on the 68000 in a fullword instruction it is possible to
use an immediate operand; but if the immediate value is between -128
and 127, better code results from loading the value into a register and
using the register.  This is because the load into the register can be
done with a <code>moveq</code> instruction.  We arrange for this to happen
by defining the letter <code>K</code> to mean "any integer outside the
range -128 to 127", and then specifying <code>Ks</code> in the operand
constraints.

<br><dt><code>g</code>
<dd>Any register, memory or immediate integer operand is allowed, except for
registers that are not general registers.

<br><dt><code>X</code>
<dd>Any operand whatsoever is allowed, even if it does not satisfy
<code>general_operand</code>.  This is normally used in the constraint of
a <code>match_scratch</code> when certain alternatives will not actually
require a scratch register.

<br><dt><code>0</code>, <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, <small>...</small> <code>9</code>
<dd>An operand that matches the specified operand number is allowed.  If a
digit is used together with letters within the same alternative, the
digit should come last.

<p>This is called a <dfn>matching constraint</dfn> and what it really means is
that the assembler has only a single operand that fills two roles
considered separate in the RTL insn.  For example, an add insn has two
input operands and one output operand in the RTL, but on most CISC
machines an add instruction really has only two operands, one of them an
input-output operand:

<pre>addl #35,r12
</pre>

<p>Matching constraints are used in these circumstances. 
More precisely, the two operands that match must include one input-only
operand and one output-only operand.  Moreover, the digit must be a
smaller number than the number of the operand that uses it in the
constraint.

<p>For operands to match in a particular case usually means that they
are identical-looking RTL expressions.  But in a few special cases
specific kinds of dissimilarity are allowed.  For example, <code>*x</code>
as an input operand will match <code>*x++</code> as an output operand. 
For proper results in such cases, the output template should always
use the output-operand's number when printing the operand.

<br><dt><code>p</code>
<dd>An operand that is a valid memory address is allowed.  This is
for "load address" and "push address" instructions.

<p><code>p</code> in the constraint must be accompanied by <code>address_operand</code>
as the predicate in the <code>match_operand</code>.  This predicate interprets
the mode specified in the <code>match_operand</code> as the mode of the memory
reference for which the address would be valid.

<br><dt><code>Q</code>, <code>R</code>, <code>S</code>, <small>...</small> <code>U</code>
<dd>Letters in the range <code>Q</code> through <code>U</code> may be defined in a
machine-dependent fashion to stand for arbitrary operand types. 
The machine description macro <code>EXTRA_CONSTRAINT</code> is passed the
operand as its first argument and the constraint letter as its
second operand.

<p>A typical use for this would be to distinguish certain types of
memory references that affect other insn operands.

<p>Do not define these constraint letters to accept register references
(<code>reg</code>); the reload pass does not expect this and would not handle
it properly. 
</dl>

<p>In order to have valid assembler code, each operand must satisfy
its constraint.  But a failure to do so does not prevent the pattern
from applying to an insn.  Instead, it directs the compiler to modify
the code so that the constraint will be satisfied.  Usually this is
done by copying an operand into a register.

<p>Contrast, therefore, the two instruction patterns that follow:

<pre>(define_insn ""
  [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "=r")
        (plus:SI (match_dup 0)
                 (match_operand:SI 1 "general_operand" "r")))]
  ""
  "<small>...</small>")
</pre>

<p>which has two operands, one of which must appear in two places, and

<pre>(define_insn ""
  [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "=r")
        (plus:SI (match_operand:SI 1 "general_operand" "0")
                 (match_operand:SI 2 "general_operand" "r")))]
  ""
  "<small>...</small>")
</pre>

<p>which has three operands, two of which are required by a constraint to be
identical.  If we are considering an insn of the form

<pre>(insn <var>n</var> <var>prev</var> <var>next</var>
  (set (reg:SI 3)
       (plus:SI (reg:SI 6) (reg:SI 109)))
  <small>...</small>)
</pre>

<p>the first pattern would not apply at all, because this insn does not
contain two identical subexpressions in the right place.  The pattern would
say, "That does not look like an add instruction; try other patterns." 
The second pattern would say, "Yes, that's an add instruction, but there
is something wrong with it."  It would direct the reload pass of the
compiler to generate additional insns to make the constraint true.  The
results might look like this:

<pre>(insn <var>n2</var> <var>prev</var> <var>n</var>
  (set (reg:SI 3) (reg:SI 6))
  <small>...</small>)

(insn <var>n</var> <var>n2</var> <var>next</var>
  (set (reg:SI 3)
       (plus:SI (reg:SI 3) (reg:SI 109)))
  <small>...</small>)
</pre>

<p>It is up to you to make sure that each operand, in each pattern, has
constraints that can handle any RTL expression that could be present for
that operand.  (When multiple alternatives are in use, each pattern must,
for each possible combination of operand expressions, have at least one
alternative which can handle that combination of operands.)  The
constraints don't need to <em>allow</em> any possible operand--when this is
the case, they do not constrain--but they must at least point the way to
reloading any possible operand so that it will fit.

<ul>
<li>If the constraint accepts whatever operands the predicate permits,
there is no problem: reloading is never necessary for this operand.

<p>For example, an operand whose constraints permit everything except
registers is safe provided its predicate rejects registers.

<p>An operand whose predicate accepts only constant values is safe
provided its constraints include the letter <code>i</code>.  If any possible
constant value is accepted, then nothing less than <code>i</code> will do;
if the predicate is more selective, then the constraints may also be
more selective.

</p><li>Any operand expression can be reloaded by copying it into a register. 
So if an operand's constraints allow some kind of register, it is
certain to be safe.  It need not permit all classes of registers; the
compiler knows how to copy a register into another register of the
proper class in order to make an instruction valid.

<li>A nonoffsettable memory reference can be reloaded by copying the
address into a register.  So if the constraint uses the letter
<code>o</code>, all memory references are taken care of.

<li>A constant operand can be reloaded by allocating space in memory to
hold it as preinitialized data.  Then the memory reference can be used
in place of the constant.  So if the constraint uses the letters
<code>o</code> or <code>m</code>, constant operands are not a problem.

<li>If the constraint permits a constant and a pseudo register used in an insn
was not allocated to a hard register and is equivalent to a constant,
the register will be replaced with the constant.  If the predicate does
not permit a constant and the insn is re-recognized for some reason, the
compiler will crash.  Thus the predicate must always recognize any
objects allowed by the constraint. 
</ul>

<p>If the operand's predicate can recognize registers, but the constraint does
not permit them, it can make the compiler crash.  When this operand happens
to be a register, the reload pass will be stymied, because it does not know
how to copy a register temporarily into memory.

<p>If the predicate accepts a unary operator, the constraint applies to the
operand.  For example, the MIPS processor at ISA level 3 supports an
instruction which adds two registers in <code>SImode</code> to produce a
<code>DImode</code> result, but only if the registers are correctly sign
extended.  This predicate for the input operands accepts a
<code>sign_extend</code> of an <code>SImode</code> register.  Write the constraint
to indicate the type of register that is required for the operand of the
<code>sign_extend</code>.

<h3>Multiple Alternative Constraints</h3>

<p>Sometimes a single instruction has multiple alternative sets of possible
operands.  For example, on the 68000, a logical-or instruction can combine
register or an immediate value into memory, or it can combine any kind of
operand into a register; but it cannot combine one memory location into
another.

<p>These constraints are represented as multiple alternatives.  An alternative
can be described by a series of letters for each operand.  The overall
constraint for an operand is made from the letters for this operand
from the first alternative, a comma, the letters for this operand from
the second alternative, a comma, and so on until the last alternative. 
Here is how it is done for fullword logical-or on the 68000:

<pre>(define_insn "iorsi3"
  [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "=m,d")
        (ior:SI (match_operand:SI 1 "general_operand" "%0,0")
                (match_operand:SI 2 "general_operand" "dKs,dmKs")))]
  <small>...</small>)
</pre>

<p>The first alternative has <code>m</code> (memory) for operand 0, <code>0</code> for
operand 1 (meaning it must match operand 0), and <code>dKs</code> for operand
2.  The second alternative has <code>d</code> (data register) for operand 0,
<code>0</code> for operand 1, and <code>dmKs</code> for operand 2.  The <code>=</code> and
<code>%</code> in the constraints apply to all the alternatives; their
meaning is explained in the next section (see <a href="#Class%20Preferences">Class Preferences</a>).

<p>If all the operands fit any one alternative, the instruction is valid. 
Otherwise, for each alternative, the compiler counts how many instructions
must be added to copy the operands so that that alternative applies. 
The alternative requiring the least copying is chosen.  If two alternatives
need the same amount of copying, the one that comes first is chosen. 
These choices can be altered with the <code>?</code> and <code>!</code> characters:

<dl>
<dt><code>?</code>
<dd>Disparage slightly the alternative that the <code>?</code> appears in,
as a choice when no alternative applies exactly.  The compiler regards
this alternative as one unit more costly for each <code>?</code> that appears
in it.

<br><dt><code>!</code>
<dd>Disparage severely the alternative that the <code>!</code> appears in. 
This alternative can still be used if it fits without reloading,
but if reloading is needed, some other alternative will be used. 
</dl>

<p>When an insn pattern has multiple alternatives in its constraints, often
the appearance of the assembler code is determined mostly by which
alternative was matched.  When this is so, the C code for writing the
assembler code can use the variable <code>which_alternative</code>, which is
the ordinal number of the alternative that was actually satisfied (0 for
the first, 1 for the second alternative, etc.).  See <a href="#Output%20Statement">Output Statement</a>.

<h3>Register Class Preferences</h3>

<p>The operand constraints have another function: they enable the compiler
to decide which kind of hardware register a pseudo register is best
allocated to.  The compiler examines the constraints that apply to the
insns that use the pseudo register, looking for the machine-dependent
letters such as <code>d</code> and <code>a</code> that specify classes of registers. 
The pseudo register is put in whichever class gets the most "votes". 
The constraint letters <code>g</code> and <code>r</code> also vote: they vote in
favor of a general register.  The machine description says which registers
are considered general.

<p>Of course, on some machines all registers are equivalent, and no register
classes are defined.  Then none of this complexity is relevant.

<h3>Constraint Modifier Characters</h3>

<p>Here are constraint modifier characters.

<dl>
<dt><code>=</code>
<dd>Means that this operand is write-only for this instruction: the previous
value is discarded and replaced by output data.

<br><dt><code>+</code>
<dd>Means that this operand is both read and written by the instruction.

<p>When the compiler fixes up the operands to satisfy the constraints,
it needs to know which operands are inputs to the instruction and
which are outputs from it.  <code>=</code> identifies an output; <code>+</code>
identifies an operand that is both input and output; all other operands
are assumed to be input only.

<br><dt><code>&amp;</code>
<dd>Means (in a particular alternative) that this operand is an
<dfn>earlyclobber</dfn> operand, which is modified before the instruction is
finished using the input operands.  Therefore, this operand may not lie
in a register that is used as an input operand or as part of any memory
address.

<p><code>&amp;</code> applies only to the alternative in which it is written.  In
constraints with multiple alternatives, sometimes one alternative
requires <code>&amp;</code> while others do not.  See, for example, the
<code>movdf</code> insn of the 68000.

<p>An input operand can be tied to an earlyclobber operand if its only
use as an input occurs before the early result is written.  Adding
alternatives of this form often allows GCC to produce better code
when only some of the inputs can be affected by the earlyclobber. 
See, for example, the <code>mulsi3</code> insn of the ARM.

<p><code>&amp;</code> does not obviate the need to write <code>=</code>.

<br><dt><code>%</code>
<dd>Declares the instruction to be commutative for this operand and the
following operand.  This means that the compiler may interchange the
two operands if that is the cheapest way to make all operands fit the
constraints. 
This is often used in patterns for addition instructions
that really have only two operands: the result must go in one of the
arguments.  Here for example, is how the 68000 halfword-add
instruction is defined:

<pre>(define_insn "addhi3"
  [(set (match_operand:HI 0 "general_operand" "=m,r")
     (plus:HI (match_operand:HI 1 "general_operand" "%0,0")
              (match_operand:HI 2 "general_operand" "di,g")))]
  <small>...</small>)
</pre>

<br><dt><code>#</code>
<dd>Says that all following characters, up to the next comma, are to be
ignored as a constraint.  They are significant only for choosing
register preferences.

<br><dt><code>*</code>
<dd>Says that the following character should be ignored when choosing
register preferences.  <code>*</code> has no effect on the meaning of the
constraint as a constraint, and no effect on reloading.

<p>Here is an example: the 68000 has an instruction to sign-extend a
halfword in a data register, and can also sign-extend a value by
copying it into an address register.  While either kind of register is
acceptable, the constraints on an address-register destination are
less strict, so it is best if register allocation makes an address
register its goal.  Therefore, <code>*</code> is used so that the <code>d</code>
constraint letter (for data register) is ignored when computing
register preferences.

<pre>(define_insn "extendhisi2"
  [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "=*d,a")
        (sign_extend:SI
         (match_operand:HI 1 "general_operand" "0,g")))]
  <small>...</small>)
</pre>

<h3>Constraints for Particular Machines</h3>

<p>Whenever possible, you should use the general-purpose constraint letters
in <code>asm</code> arguments, since they will convey meaning more readily to
people reading your code.  Failing that, use the constraint letters
that usually have very similar meanings across architectures.  The most
commonly used constraints are <code>m</code> and <code>r</code> (for memory and
general-purpose registers respectively; see <a href="#Simple%20Constraints">Simple Constraints</a>), and
<code>I</code>, usually the letter indicating the most common
immediate-constant format.

<p>For each machine architecture, the <code>config/<var>machine</var>.h</code> file
defines additional constraints.  These constraints are used by the
compiler itself for instruction generation, as well as for <code>asm</code>
statements; therefore, some of the constraints are not particularly
interesting for <code>asm</code>.  The constraints are defined through these
macros:

<dl>
<dt><code>REG_CLASS_FROM_LETTER</code>
<dd>Register class constraints (usually lower case).

<br><dt><code>CONST_OK_FOR_LETTER_P</code>
<dd>Immediate constant constraints, for non-floating point constants of
word size or smaller precision (usually upper case).

<br><dt><code>CONST_DOUBLE_OK_FOR_LETTER_P</code>
<dd>Immediate constant constraints, for all floating point constants and for
constants of greater than word size precision (usually upper case).

<br><dt><code>EXTRA_CONSTRAINT</code>
<dd>Special cases of registers or memory.  This macro is not required, and
is only defined for some machines. 
</dl>

<p>Inspecting these macro definitions in the compiler source for your
machine is the best way to be certain you have the right constraints. 
However, here is a summary of the machine-dependent constraints
available on some particular machines.

<h3>Not Using Constraints</h3>

<p>Some machines are so clean that operand constraints are not required.  For
example, on the Vax, an operand valid in one context is valid in any other
context.  On such a machine, every operand constraint would be <code>g</code>,
excepting only operands of "load address" instructions which are
written as if they referred to a memory location's contents but actual
refer to its address.  They would have constraint <code>p</code>.

<p>For such machines, instead of writing <code>g</code> and <code>p</code> for all
the constraints, you can choose to write a description with empty constraints. 
Then you write <code>""</code> for the constraint in every <code>match_operand</code>. 
Address operands are identified by writing an <code>address</code> expression
around the <code>match_operand</code>, not by their constraints.

<p>When the machine description has just empty constraints, certain parts
of compilation are skipped, making the compiler faster.  However,
few machines actually do not need constraints; all machine descriptions
now in existence use constraints.

<br>

<h2>Standard Pattern Names For Generation</h2>

<p>Here is a table of the instruction names that are meaningful in the RTL
generation pass of the compiler.  Giving one of these names to an
instruction pattern tells the RTL generation pass that it can use the
pattern to accomplish a certain task.

<dl>
<dt><code>mov<var>m</var></code>
<dd>Here <var>m</var> stands for a two-letter machine mode name, in lower case. 
This instruction pattern moves data with that machine mode from operand
1 to operand 0.  For example, <code>movsi</code> moves full-word data.

<p>If operand 0 is a <code>subreg</code> with mode <var>m</var> of a register whose
own mode is wider than <var>m</var>, the effect of this instruction is
to store the specified value in the part of the register that corresponds
to mode <var>m</var>.  The effect on the rest of the register is undefined.

<p>This class of patterns is special in several ways.  First of all, each
of these names <em>must</em> be defined, because there is no other way
to copy a datum from one place to another.

<p>Second, these patterns are not used solely in the RTL generation pass. 
Even the reload pass can generate move insns to copy values from stack
slots into temporary registers.  When it does so, one of the operands is
a hard register and the other is an operand that can need to be reloaded
into a register.

<p>Therefore, when given such a pair of operands, the pattern must generate
RTL which needs no reloading and needs no temporary registers--no
registers other than the operands.  For example, if you support the
pattern with a <code>define_expand</code>, then in such a case the
<code>define_expand</code> mustn't call <code>force_reg</code> or any other such
function which might generate new pseudo registers.

<p>This requirement exists even for subword modes on a RISC machine where
fetching those modes from memory normally requires several insns and
some temporary registers.  Look in <code>spur.md</code> to see how the
requirement can be satisfied.

<p>During reload a memory reference with an invalid address may be passed
as an operand.  Such an address will be replaced with a valid address
later in the reload pass.  In this case, nothing may be done with the
address except to use it as it stands.  If it is copied, it will not be
replaced with a valid address.  No attempt should be made to make such
an address into a valid address and no routine (such as
<code>change_address</code>) that will do so may be called.  Note that
<code>general_operand</code> will fail when applied to such an address.

<p>The global variable <code>reload_in_progress</code> (which must be explicitly
declared if required) can be used to determine whether such special
handling is required.

<p>The variety of operands that have reloads depends on the rest of the
machine description, but typically on a RISC machine these can only be
pseudo registers that did not get hard registers, while on other
machines explicit memory references will get optional reloads.

<p>If a scratch register is required to move an object to or from memory,
it can be allocated using <code>gen_reg_rtx</code> prior to life analysis.

<p>If there are cases needing
scratch registers after reload, you must define
<code>SECONDARY_INPUT_RELOAD_CLASS</code> and perhaps also
<code>SECONDARY_OUTPUT_RELOAD_CLASS</code> to detect them, and provide
patterns <code>reload_in<var>m</var></code> or <code>reload_out<var>m</var></code> to handle
them.  See <a href="#Register%20Classes">Register Classes</a>.

<p>The global variable <code>no_new_pseudos</code> can be used to determine if it
is unsafe to create new pseudo registers.  If this variable is nonzero, then
it is unsafe to call <code>gen_reg_rtx</code> to allocate a new pseudo.

<p>The constraints on a <code>mov<var>m</var></code> must permit moving any hard
register to any other hard register provided that
<code>HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK</code> permits mode <var>m</var> in both registers and
<code>REGISTER_MOVE_COST</code> applied to their classes returns a value of 2.

<p>It is obligatory to support floating point <code>mov<var>m</var></code>
instructions into and out of any registers that can hold fixed point
values, because unions and structures (which have modes <code>SImode</code> or
<code>DImode</code>) can be in those registers and they may have floating
point members.

<p>There may also be a need to support fixed point <code>mov<var>m</var></code>
instructions in and out of floating point registers.  Unfortunately, I
have forgotten why this was so, and I don't know whether it is still
true.  If <code>HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK</code> rejects fixed point values in
floating point registers, then the constraints of the fixed point
<code>mov<var>m</var></code> instructions must be designed to avoid ever trying to
reload into a floating point register.

<br><dt><code>reload_in<var>m</var></code>
<dt><code>reload_out<var>m</var></code>
<dd>Like <code>mov<var>m</var></code>, but used when a scratch register is required to
move between operand 0 and operand 1.  Operand 2 describes the scratch
register.  See the discussion of the <code>SECONDARY_RELOAD_CLASS</code>
macro in see <a href="#Register%20Classes">Register Classes</a>.

<br><dt><code>movstrict<var>m</var></code>
<dd>Like <code>mov<var>m</var></code> except that if operand 0 is a <code>subreg</code>
with mode <var>m</var> of a register whose natural mode is wider,
the <code>movstrict<var>m</var></code> instruction is guaranteed not to alter
any of the register except the part which belongs to mode <var>m</var>.

<br><dt><code>load_multiple</code>
<dd>Load several consecutive memory locations into consecutive registers. 
Operand 0 is the first of the consecutive registers, operand 1
is the first memory location, and operand 2 is a constant: the
number of consecutive registers.

<p>Define this only if the target machine really has such an instruction;
do not define this if the most efficient way of loading consecutive
registers from memory is to do them one at a time.

<p>On some machines, there are restrictions as to which consecutive
registers can be stored into memory, such as particular starting or
ending register numbers or only a range of valid counts.  For those
machines, use a <code>define_expand</code> (see <a href="#Expander%20Definitions">Expander Definitions</a>)
and make the pattern fail if the restrictions are not met.

<p>Write the generated insn as a <code>parallel</code> with elements being a
<code>set</code> of one register from the appropriate memory location (you may
also need <code>use</code> or <code>clobber</code> elements).  Use a
<code>match_parallel</code> (see <a href="#RTL%20Template">RTL Template</a>) to recognize the insn.  See
<code>a29k.md</code> and <code>rs6000.md</code> for examples of the use of this insn
pattern.

<br><dt><code>store_multiple</code>
<dd>Similar to <code>load_multiple</code>, but store several consecutive registers
into consecutive memory locations.  Operand 0 is the first of the
consecutive memory locations, operand 1 is the first register, and
operand 2 is a constant: the number of consecutive registers.

<br><dt><code>add<var>m</var>3</code>
<dd>Add operand 2 and operand 1, storing the result in operand 0.  All operands
must have mode <var>m</var>.  This can be used even on two-address machines, by
means of constraints requiring operands 1 and 0 to be the same location.

<br><dt><code>sub<var>m</var>3</code>, <code>mul<var>m</var>3</code>
<dt><code>div<var>m</var>3</code>, <code>udiv<var>m</var>3</code>, <code>mod<var>m</var>3</code>, <code>umod<var>m</var>3</code>
<dt><code>smin<var>m</var>3</code>, <code>smax<var>m</var>3</code>, <code>umin<var>m</var>3</code>, <code>umax<var>m</var>3</code>
<dt><code>and<var>m</var>3</code>, <code>ior<var>m</var>3</code>, <code>xor<var>m</var>3</code>
<dd>Similar, for other arithmetic operations.

<br><dt><code>mulhisi3</code>
<dd>Multiply operands 1 and 2, which have mode <code>HImode</code>, and store
a <code>SImode</code> product in operand 0.

<br><dt><code>mulqihi3</code>, <code>mulsidi3</code>
<dd>Similar widening-multiplication instructions of other widths.

<br><dt><code>umulqihi3</code>, <code>umulhisi3</code>, <code>umulsidi3</code>
<dd>Similar widening-multiplication instructions that do unsigned
multiplication.

<br><dt><code>mul<var>m</var>3_highpart</code>
<dd>Perform a signed multiplication of operands 1 and 2, which have mode
<var>m</var>, and store the most significant half of the product in operand 0. 
The least significant half of the product is discarded.

<br><dt><code>umul<var>m</var>3_highpart</code>
<dd>Similar, but the multiplication is unsigned.

<br><dt><code>divmod<var>m</var>4</code>
<dd>Signed division that produces both a quotient and a remainder. 
Operand 1 is divided by operand 2 to produce a quotient stored
in operand 0 and a remainder stored in operand 3.

<p>For machines with an instruction that produces both a quotient and a
remainder, provide a pattern for <code>divmod<var>m</var>4</code> but do not
provide patterns for <code>div<var>m</var>3</code> and <code>mod<var>m</var>3</code>.  This
allows optimization in the relatively common case when both the quotient
and remainder are computed.

<p>If an instruction that just produces a quotient or just a remainder
exists and is more efficient than the instruction that produces both,
write the output routine of <code>divmod<var>m</var>4</code> to call
<code>find_reg_note</code> and look for a <code>REG_UNUSED</code> note on the
quotient or remainder and generate the appropriate instruction.

<br><dt><code>udivmod<var>m</var>4</code>
<dd>Similar, but does unsigned division.

<br><dt><code>ashl<var>m</var>3</code>
<dd>Arithmetic-shift operand 1 left by a number of bits specified by operand
2, and store the result in operand 0.  Here <var>m</var> is the mode of
operand 0 and operand 1; operand 2's mode is specified by the
instruction pattern, and the compiler will convert the operand to that
mode before generating the instruction.

<br><dt><code>ashr<var>m</var>3</code>, <code>lshr<var>m</var>3</code>, <code>rotl<var>m</var>3</code>, <code>rotr<var>m</var>3</code>
<dd>Other shift and rotate instructions, analogous to the
<code>ashl<var>m</var>3</code> instructions.

<br><dt><code>neg<var>m</var>2</code>
<dd>Negate operand 1 and store the result in operand 0.

<br><dt><code>abs<var>m</var>2</code>
<dd>Store the absolute value of operand 1 into operand 0.

<br><dt><code>sqrt<var>m</var>2</code>
<dd>Store the square root of operand 1 into operand 0.

<p>The <code>sqrt</code> built-in function of C always uses the mode which
corresponds to the C data type <code>double</code>.

<br><dt><code>ffs<var>m</var>2</code>
<dd>Store into operand 0 one plus the index of the least significant 1-bit
of operand 1.  If operand 1 is zero, store zero.  <var>m</var> is the mode
of operand 0; operand 1's mode is specified by the instruction
pattern, and the compiler will convert the operand to that mode before
generating the instruction.

<p>The <code>ffs</code> built-in function of C always uses the mode which
corresponds to the C data type <code>int</code>.

<br><dt><code>one_cmpl<var>m</var>2</code>
<dd>Store the bitwise-complement of operand 1 into operand 0.

<br><dt><code>cmp<var>m</var></code>
<dd>Compare operand 0 and operand 1, and set the condition codes. 
The RTL pattern should look like this:

<pre>(set (cc0) (compare (match_operand:<var>m</var> 0 <small>...</small>)
                    (match_operand:<var>m</var> 1 <small>...</small>)))
</pre>

<br><dt><code>tst<var>m</var></code>
<dd>Compare operand 0 against zero, and set the condition codes. 
The RTL pattern should look like this:

<pre>(set (cc0) (match_operand:<var>m</var> 0 <small>...</small>))
</pre>

<p><code>tst<var>m</var></code> patterns should not be defined for machines that do
not use <code>(cc0)</code>.  Doing so would confuse the optimizer since it
would no longer be clear which <code>set</code> operations were comparisons. 
The <code>cmp<var>m</var></code> patterns should be used instead.

<br><dt><code>movstr<var>m</var></code>
<dd>Block move instruction.  The addresses of the destination and source
strings are the first two operands, and both are in mode <code>Pmode</code>.

<p>The number of bytes to move is the third operand, in mode <var>m</var>. 
Usually, you specify <code>word_mode</code> for <var>m</var>.  However, if you can
generate better code knowing the range of valid lengths is smaller than
those representable in a full word, you should provide a pattern with a
mode corresponding to the range of values you can handle efficiently
(e.g., <code>QImode</code> for values in the range 0-127; note we avoid numbers
that appear negative) and also a pattern with <code>word_mode</code>.

<p>The fourth operand is the known shared alignment of the source and
destination, in the form of a <code>const_int</code> rtx.  Thus, if the
compiler knows that both source and destination are word-aligned,
it may provide the value 4 for this operand.

<p>Descriptions of multiple <code>movstr<var>m</var></code> patterns can only be
beneficial if the patterns for smaller modes have fewer restrictions
on their first, second and fourth operands.  Note that the mode <var>m</var>
in <code>movstr<var>m</var></code> does not impose any restriction on the mode of
individually moved data units in the block.

<p>These patterns need not give special consideration to the possibility
that the source and destination strings might overlap.

<br><dt><code>clrstr<var>m</var></code>
<dd>Block clear instruction.  The addresses of the destination string is the
first operand, in mode <code>Pmode</code>.  The number of bytes to clear is
the second operand, in mode <var>m</var>.  See <code>movstr<var>m</var></code> for
a discussion of the choice of mode.

<p>The third operand is the known alignment of the destination, in the form
of a <code>const_int</code> rtx.  Thus, if the compiler knows that the
destination is word-aligned, it may provide the value 4 for this
operand.

<p>The use for multiple <code>clrstr<var>m</var></code> is as for <code>movstr<var>m</var></code>.

<br><dt><code>cmpstr<var>m</var></code>
<dd>Block compare instruction, with five operands.  Operand 0 is the output;
it has mode <var>m</var>.  The remaining four operands are like the operands
of <code>movstr<var>m</var></code>.  The two memory blocks specified are compared
byte by byte in lexicographic order.  The effect of the instruction is
to store a value in operand 0 whose sign indicates the result of the
comparison.

<br><dt><code>strlen<var>m</var></code>
<dd>Compute the length of a string, with three operands. 
Operand 0 is the result (of mode <var>m</var>), operand 1 is
a <code>mem</code> referring to the first character of the string,
operand 2 is the character to search for (normally zero),
and operand 3 is a constant describing the known alignment
of the beginning of the string.

<br><dt><code>float<var>m</var><var>n</var>2</code>
<dd>Convert signed integer operand 1 (valid for fixed point mode <var>m</var>) to
floating point mode <var>n</var> and store in operand 0 (which has mode
<var>n</var>).

<br><dt><code>floatuns<var>m</var><var>n</var>2</code>
<dd>Convert unsigned integer operand 1 (valid for fixed point mode <var>m</var>)
to floating point mode <var>n</var> and store in operand 0 (which has mode
<var>n</var>).

<br><dt><code>fix<var>m</var><var>n</var>2</code>
<dd>Convert operand 1 (valid for floating point mode <var>m</var>) to fixed
point mode <var>n</var> as a signed number and store in operand 0 (which
has mode <var>n</var>).  This instruction's result is defined only when
the value of operand 1 is an integer.

<br><dt><code>fixuns<var>m</var><var>n</var>2</code>
<dd>Convert operand 1 (valid for floating point mode <var>m</var>) to fixed
point mode <var>n</var> as an unsigned number and store in operand 0 (which
has mode <var>n</var>).  This instruction's result is defined only when the
value of operand 1 is an integer.

<br><dt><code>ftrunc<var>m</var>2</code>
<dd>Convert operand 1 (valid for floating point mode <var>m</var>) to an
integer value, still represented in floating point mode <var>m</var>, and
store it in operand 0 (valid for floating point mode <var>m</var>).

<br><dt><code>fix_trunc<var>m</var><var>n</var>2</code>
<dd>Like <code>fix<var>m</var><var>n</var>2</code> but works for any floating point value
of mode <var>m</var> by converting the value to an integer.

<br><dt><code>fixuns_trunc<var>m</var><var>n</var>2</code>
<dd>Like <code>fixuns<var>m</var><var>n</var>2</code> but works for any floating point
value of mode <var>m</var> by converting the value to an integer.

<br><dt><code>trunc<var>m</var><var>n</var>2</code>
<dd>Truncate operand 1 (valid for mode <var>m</var>) to mode <var>n</var> and
store in operand 0 (which has mode <var>n</var>).  Both modes must be fixed
point or both floating point.

<br><dt><code>extend<var>m</var><var>n</var>2</code>
<dd>Sign-extend operand 1 (valid for mode <var>m</var>) to mode <var>n</var> and
store in operand 0 (which has mode <var>n</var>).  Both modes must be fixed
point or both floating point.

<br><dt><code>zero_extend<var>m</var><var>n</var>2</code>
<dd>Zero-extend operand 1 (valid for mode <var>m</var>) to mode <var>n</var> and
store in operand 0 (which has mode <var>n</var>).  Both modes must be fixed
point.

<br><dt><code>extv</code>
<dd>Extract a bit field from operand 1 (a register or memory operand), where
operand 2 specifies the width in bits and operand 3 the starting bit,
and store it in operand 0.  Operand 0 must have mode <code>word_mode</code>. 
Operand 1 may have mode <code>byte_mode</code> or <code>word_mode</code>; often
<code>word_mode</code> is allowed only for registers.  Operands 2 and 3 must
be valid for <code>word_mode</code>.

<p>The RTL generation pass generates this instruction only with constants
for operands 2 and 3.

<p>The bit-field value is sign-extended to a full word integer
before it is stored in operand 0.

<br><dt><code>extzv</code>
<dd>Like <code>extv</code> except that the bit-field value is zero-extended.

<br><dt><code>insv</code>
<dd>Store operand 3 (which must be valid for <code>word_mode</code>) into a bit
field in operand 0, where operand 1 specifies the width in bits and
operand 2 the starting bit.  Operand 0 may have mode <code>byte_mode</code> or
<code>word_mode</code>; often <code>word_mode</code> is allowed only for registers. 
Operands 1 and 2 must be valid for <code>word_mode</code>.

<p>The RTL generation pass generates this instruction only with constants
for operands 1 and 2.

<br><dt><code>mov<var>mode</var>cc</code>
<dd>Conditionally move operand 2 or operand 3 into operand 0 according to the
comparison in operand 1.  If the comparison is true, operand 2 is moved
into operand 0, otherwise operand 3 is moved.

<p>The mode of the operands being compared need not be the same as the operands
being moved.  Some machines, sparc64 for example, have instructions that
conditionally move an integer value based on the floating point condition
codes and vice versa.

<p>If the machine does not have conditional move instructions, do not
define these patterns.

<br><dt><code>s<var>cond</var></code>
<dd>Store zero or nonzero in the operand according to the condition codes. 
Value stored is nonzero iff the condition <var>cond</var> is true. 
<var>cond</var> is the name of a comparison operation expression code, such
as <code>eq</code>, <code>lt</code> or <code>leu</code>.

<p>You specify the mode that the operand must have when you write the
<code>match_operand</code> expression.  The compiler automatically sees
which mode you have used and supplies an operand of that mode.

<p>The value stored for a true condition must have 1 as its low bit, or
else must be negative.  Otherwise the instruction is not suitable and
you should omit it from the machine description.  You describe to the
compiler exactly which value is stored by defining the macro
<code>STORE_FLAG_VALUE</code> (see <a href="#Misc">Misc</a>).  If a description cannot be
found that can be used for all the <code>s<var>cond</var></code> patterns, you
should omit those operations from the machine description.

<p>These operations may fail, but should do so only in relatively
uncommon cases; if they would fail for common cases involving
integer comparisons, it is best to omit these patterns.

<p>If these operations are omitted, the compiler will usually generate code
that copies the constant one to the target and branches around an
assignment of zero to the target.  If this code is more efficient than
the potential instructions used for the <code>s<var>cond</var></code> pattern
followed by those required to convert the result into a 1 or a zero in
<code>SImode</code>, you should omit the <code>s<var>cond</var></code> operations from
the machine description.

<br><dt><code>b<var>cond</var></code>
<dd>Conditional branch instruction.  Operand 0 is a <code>label_ref</code> that
refers to the label to jump to.  Jump if the condition codes meet
condition <var>cond</var>.

<p>Some machines do not follow the model assumed here where a comparison
instruction is followed by a conditional branch instruction.  In that
case, the <code>cmp<var>m</var></code> (and <code>tst<var>m</var></code>) patterns should
simply store the operands away and generate all the required insns in a
<code>define_expand</code> (see <a href="#Expander%20Definitions">Expander Definitions</a>) for the conditional
branch operations.  All calls to expand <code>b<var>cond</var></code> patterns are
immediately preceded by calls to expand either a <code>cmp<var>m</var></code>
pattern or a <code>tst<var>m</var></code> pattern.

<p>Machines that use a pseudo register for the condition code value, or
where the mode used for the comparison depends on the condition being
tested, should also use the above mechanism.  See <a href="#Jump%20Patterns">Jump Patterns</a>.

<p>The above discussion also applies to the <code>mov<var>mode</var>cc</code> and
<code>s<var>cond</var></code> patterns.

<br><dt><code>call</code>
<dd>Subroutine call instruction returning no value.  Operand 0 is the
function to call; operand 1 is the number of bytes of arguments pushed
as a <code>const_int</code>; operand 2 is the number of registers used as
operands.

<p>On most machines, operand 2 is not actually stored into the RTL
pattern.  It is supplied for the sake of some RISC machines which need
to put this information into the assembler code; they can put it in
the RTL instead of operand 1.

<p>Operand 0 should be a <code>mem</code> RTX whose address is the address of the
function.  Note, however, that this address can be a <code>symbol_ref</code>
expression even if it would not be a legitimate memory address on the
target machine.  If it is also not a valid argument for a call
instruction, the pattern for this operation should be a
<code>define_expand</code> (see <a href="#Expander%20Definitions">Expander Definitions</a>) that places the
address into a register and uses that register in the call instruction.

<br><dt><code>call_value</code>
<dd>Subroutine call instruction returning a value.  Operand 0 is the hard
register in which the value is returned.  There are three more
operands, the same as the three operands of the <code>call</code>
instruction (but with numbers increased by one).

<p>Subroutines that return <code>BLKmode</code> objects use the <code>call</code>
insn.

<br><dt><code>call_pop</code>, <code>call_value_pop</code>
<dd>Similar to <code>call</code> and <code>call_value</code>, except used if defined and
if <code>RETURN_POPS_ARGS</code> is non-zero.  They should emit a <code>parallel</code>
that contains both the function call and a <code>set</code> to indicate the
adjustment made to the frame pointer.

<p>For machines where <code>RETURN_POPS_ARGS</code> can be non-zero, the use of these
patterns increases the number of functions for which the frame pointer
can be eliminated, if desired.

<br><dt><code>untyped_call</code>
<dd>Subroutine call instruction returning a value of any type.  Operand 0 is
the function to call; operand 1 is a memory location where the result of
calling the function is to be stored; operand 2 is a <code>parallel</code>
expression where each element is a <code>set</code> expression that indicates
the saving of a function return value into the result block.

<p>This instruction pattern should be defined to support
<code>__builtin_apply</code> on machines where special instructions are needed
to call a subroutine with arbitrary arguments or to save the value
returned.  This instruction pattern is required on machines that have
multiple registers that can hold a return value (i.e. 
<code>FUNCTION_VALUE_REGNO_P</code> is true for more than one register).

<br><dt><code>return</code>
<dd>Subroutine return instruction.  This instruction pattern name should be
defined only if a single instruction can do all the work of returning
from a function.

<p>Like the <code>mov<var>m</var></code> patterns, this pattern is also used after the
RTL generation phase.  In this case it is to support machines where
multiple instructions are usually needed to return from a function, but
some class of functions only requires one instruction to implement a
return.  Normally, the applicable functions are those which do not need
to save any registers or allocate stack space.

<p>For such machines, the condition specified in this pattern should only
be true when <code>reload_completed</code> is non-zero and the function's
epilogue would only be a single instruction.  For machines with register
windows, the routine <code>leaf_function_p</code> may be used to determine if
a register window push is required.

<p>Machines that have conditional return instructions should define patterns
such as

<pre>(define_insn ""
  [(set (pc)
        (if_then_else (match_operator
                         0 "comparison_operator"
                         [(cc0) (const_int 0)])
                      (return)
                      (pc)))]
  "<var>condition</var>"
  "<small>...</small>")
</pre>

<p>where <var>condition</var> would normally be the same condition specified on the
named <code>return</code> pattern.

<br><dt><code>untyped_return</code>
<dd>Untyped subroutine return instruction.  This instruction pattern should
be defined to support <code>__builtin_return</code> on machines where special
instructions are needed to return a value of any type.

<p>Operand 0 is a memory location where the result of calling a function
with <code>__builtin_apply</code> is stored; operand 1 is a <code>parallel</code>
expression where each element is a <code>set</code> expression that indicates
the restoring of a function return value from the result block.

<br><dt><code>nop</code>
<dd>No-op instruction.  This instruction pattern name should always be defined
to output a no-op in assembler code.  <code>(const_int 0)</code> will do as an
RTL pattern.

<br><dt><code>indirect_jump</code>
<dd>An instruction to jump to an address which is operand zero. 
This pattern name is mandatory on all machines.

<br><dt><code>casesi</code>
<dd>Instruction to jump through a dispatch table, including bounds checking. 
This instruction takes five operands:

<ol type=1 start=1>
</p><li>The index to dispatch on, which has mode <code>SImode</code>.

<li>The lower bound for indices in the table, an integer constant.

<li>The total range of indices in the table--the largest index
minus the smallest one (both inclusive).

<li>A label that precedes the table itself.

<li>A label to jump to if the index has a value outside the bounds. 
(If the machine-description macro <code>CASE_DROPS_THROUGH</code> is defined,
then an out-of-bounds index drops through to the code following
the jump table instead of jumping to this label.  In that case,
this label is not actually used by the <code>casesi</code> instruction,
but it is always provided as an operand.)
</ol>

<p>The table is a <code>addr_vec</code> or <code>addr_diff_vec</code> inside of a
<code>jump_insn</code>.  The number of elements in the table is one plus the
difference between the upper bound and the lower bound.

<br><dt><code>tablejump</code>
<dd>Instruction to jump to a variable address.  This is a low-level
capability which can be used to implement a dispatch table when there
is no <code>casesi</code> pattern.

<p>This pattern requires two operands: the address or offset, and a label
which should immediately precede the jump table.  If the macro
<code>CASE_VECTOR_PC_RELATIVE</code> evaluates to a nonzero value then the first
operand is an offset which counts from the address of the table; otherwise,
it is an absolute address to jump to.  In either case, the first operand has
mode <code>Pmode</code>.

<p>The <code>tablejump</code> insn is always the last insn before the jump
table it uses.  Its assembler code normally has no need to use the
second operand, but you should incorporate it in the RTL pattern so
that the jump optimizer will not delete the table as unreachable code.

<br><dt><code>canonicalize_funcptr_for_compare</code>
<dd>Canonicalize the function pointer in operand 1 and store the result
into operand 0.

<p>Operand 0 is always a <code>reg</code> and has mode <code>Pmode</code>; operand 1
may be a <code>reg</code>, <code>mem</code>, <code>symbol_ref</code>, <code>const_int</code>, etc
and also has mode <code>Pmode</code>.

<p>Canonicalization of a function pointer usually involves computing
the address of the function which would be called if the function
pointer were used in an indirect call.

<p>Only define this pattern if function pointers on the target machine
can have different values but still call the same function when
used in an indirect call.

<br><dt><code>save_stack_block</code>
<dt><code>save_stack_function</code>
<dt><code>save_stack_nonlocal</code>
<dt><code>restore_stack_block</code>
<dt><code>restore_stack_function</code>
<dt><code>restore_stack_nonlocal</code>
<dd>Most machines save and restore the stack pointer by copying it to or
from an object of mode <code>Pmode</code>.  Do not define these patterns on
such machines.

<p>Some machines require special handling for stack pointer saves and
restores.  On those machines, define the patterns corresponding to the
non-standard cases by using a <code>define_expand</code> (see <a href="#Expander%20Definitions">Expander Definitions</a>) that produces the required insns.  The three types of
saves and restores are:

<ol type=1 start=1>
</p><li><code>save_stack_block</code> saves the stack pointer at the start of a block
that allocates a variable-sized object, and <code>restore_stack_block</code>
restores the stack pointer when the block is exited.

<li><code>save_stack_function</code> and <code>restore_stack_function</code> do a
similar job for the outermost block of a function and are used when the
function allocates variable-sized objects or calls <code>alloca</code>.  Only
the epilogue uses the restored stack pointer, allowing a simpler save or
restore sequence on some machines.

<li><code>save_stack_nonlocal</code> is used in functions that contain labels
branched to by nested functions.  It saves the stack pointer in such a
way that the inner function can use <code>restore_stack_nonlocal</code> to
restore the stack pointer.  The compiler generates code to restore the
frame and argument pointer registers, but some machines require saving
and restoring additional data such as register window information or
stack backchains.  Place insns in these patterns to save and restore any
such required data.
</ol>

<p>When saving the stack pointer, operand 0 is the save area and operand 1
is the stack pointer.  The mode used to allocate the save area defaults
to <code>Pmode</code> but you can override that choice by defining the
<code>STACK_SAVEAREA_MODE</code> macro (see <a href="#Storage%20Layout">Storage Layout</a>).  You must
specify an integral mode, or <code>VOIDmode</code> if no save area is needed
for a particular type of save (either because no save is needed or
because a machine-specific save area can be used).  Operand 0 is the
stack pointer and operand 1 is the save area for restore operations.  If
<code>save_stack_block</code> is defined, operand 0 must not be
<code>VOIDmode</code> since these saves can be arbitrarily nested.

<p>A save area is a <code>mem</code> that is at a constant offset from
<code>virtual_stack_vars_rtx</code> when the stack pointer is saved for use by
nonlocal gotos and a <code>reg</code> in the other two cases.

<br><dt><code>allocate_stack</code>
<dd>Subtract (or add if <code>STACK_GROWS_DOWNWARD</code> is undefined) operand 1 from
the stack pointer to create space for dynamically allocated data.

<p>Store the resultant pointer to this space into operand 0.  If you
are allocating space from the main stack, do this by emitting a
move insn to copy <code>virtual_stack_dynamic_rtx</code> to operand 0. 
If you are allocating the space elsewhere, generate code to copy the
location of the space to operand 0.  In the latter case, you must
ensure this space gets freed when the corresponding space on the main
stack is free.

<p>Do not define this pattern if all that must be done is the subtraction. 
Some machines require other operations such as stack probes or
maintaining the back chain.  Define this pattern to emit those
operations in addition to updating the stack pointer.

<br><dt><code>probe</code>
<dd>Some machines require instructions to be executed after space is
allocated from the stack, for example to generate a reference at
the bottom of the stack.

<p>If you need to emit instructions before the stack has been adjusted,
put them into the <code>allocate_stack</code> pattern.  Otherwise, define
this pattern to emit the required instructions.

<p>No operands are provided.

<br><dt><code>check_stack</code>
<dd>If stack checking cannot be done on your system by probing the stack with
a load or store instruction (see <a href="#Stack%20Checking">Stack Checking</a>), define this pattern
to perform the needed check and signaling an error if the stack
has overflowed.  The single operand is the location in the stack furthest
from the current stack pointer that you need to validate.  Normally,
on machines where this pattern is needed, you would obtain the stack
limit from a global or thread-specific variable or register.

<br><dt><code>nonlocal_goto</code>
<dd>Emit code to generate a non-local goto, e.g., a jump from one function
to a label in an outer function.  This pattern has four arguments,
each representing a value to be used in the jump.  The first
argument is to be loaded into the frame pointer, the second is
the address to branch to (code to dispatch to the actual label),
the third is the address of a location where the stack is saved,
and the last is the address of the label, to be placed in the
location for the incoming static chain.

<p>On most machines you need not define this pattern, since GNU CC will
already generate the correct code, which is to load the frame pointer
and static chain, restore the stack (using the
<code>restore_stack_nonlocal</code> pattern, if defined), and jump indirectly
to the dispatcher.  You need only define this pattern if this code will
not work on your machine.

<br><dt><code>nonlocal_goto_receiver</code>
<dd>This pattern, if defined, contains code needed at the target of a
nonlocal goto after the code already generated by GNU CC.  You will not
normally need to define this pattern.  A typical reason why you might
need this pattern is if some value, such as a pointer to a global table,
must be restored when the frame pointer is restored.  Note that a nonlocal
goto only ocurrs within a unit-of-translation, so a global table pointer
that is shared by all functions of a given module need not be restored. 
There are no arguments.

<br><dt><code>exception_receiver</code>
<dd>This pattern, if defined, contains code needed at the site of an
exception handler that isn't needed at the site of a nonlocal goto.  You
will not normally need to define this pattern.  A typical reason why you
might need this pattern is if some value, such as a pointer to a global
table, must be restored after control flow is branched to the handler of
an exception.  There are no arguments.

<br><dt><code>builtin_setjmp_setup</code>
<dd>This pattern, if defined, contains additional code needed to initialize
the <code>jmp_buf</code>.  You will not normally need to define this pattern. 
A typical reason why you might need this pattern is if some value, such
as a pointer to a global table, must be restored.  Though it is
preferred that the pointer value be recalculated if possible (given the
address of a label for instance).  The single argument is a pointer to
the <code>jmp_buf</code>.  Note that the buffer is five words long and that
the first three are normally used by the generic mechanism.

<br><dt><code>builtin_setjmp_receiver</code>
<dd>This pattern, if defined, contains code needed at the site of an
builtin setjmp that isn't needed at the site of a nonlocal goto.  You
will not normally need to define this pattern.  A typical reason why you
might need this pattern is if some value, such as a pointer to a global
table, must be restored.  It takes one argument, which is the label
to which builtin_longjmp transfered control; this pattern may be emitted
at a small offset from that label.

<br><dt><code>builtin_longjmp</code>
<dd>This pattern, if defined, performs the entire action of the longjmp. 
You will not normally need to define this pattern unless you also define
<code>builtin_setjmp_setup</code>.  The single argument is a pointer to the
<code>jmp_buf</code>.

<br><dt><code>eh_epilogue</code>
<dd>This pattern, if defined, affects the way <code>__builtin_eh_return</code>,
and thence <code>__throw</code> are built.  It is intended to allow communication
between the exception handling machinery and the normal epilogue code
for the target.

<p>The pattern takes three arguments.  The first is the exception context
pointer.  This will have already been copied to the function return
register appropriate for a pointer; normally this can be ignored.  The
second argument is an offset to be added to the stack pointer.  It will
have been copied to some arbitrary call-clobbered hard reg so that it
will survive until after reload to when the normal epilogue is generated. 
The final argument is the address of the exception handler to which
the function should return.  This will normally need to copied by the
pattern to some special register.

<p>This pattern must be defined if <code>RETURN_ADDR_RTX</code> does not yield
something that can be reliably and permanently modified, i.e. a fixed
hard register or a stack memory reference.

<br><dt><code>prologue</code>
<dd>This pattern, if defined, emits RTL for entry to a function.  The function
entry is resposible for setting up the stack frame, initializing the frame
pointer register, saving callee saved registers, etc.

<p>Using a prologue pattern is generally preferred over defining
<code>FUNCTION_PROLOGUE</code> to emit assembly code for the prologue.

<p>The <code>prologue</code> pattern is particularly useful for targets which perform
instruction scheduling.

<br><dt><code>epilogue</code>
<dd>This pattern, if defined, emits RTL for exit from a function.  The function
exit is resposible for deallocating the stack frame, restoring callee saved
registers and emitting the return instruction.

<p>Using an epilogue pattern is generally preferred over defining
<code>FUNCTION_EPILOGUE</code> to emit assembly code for the prologue.

<p>The <code>epilogue</code> pattern is particularly useful for targets which perform
instruction scheduling or which have delay slots for their return instruction.

<br><dt><code>sibcall_epilogue</code>
<dd>This pattern, if defined, emits RTL for exit from a function without the final
branch back to the calling function.  This pattern will be emitted before any
sibling call (aka tail call) sites.

<p>The <code>sibcall_epilogue</code> pattern must not clobber any arguments used for
parameter passing or any stack slots for arguments passed to the current
function.

<h2>When the Order of Patterns Matters</h2>

<p>Sometimes an insn can match more than one instruction pattern.  Then the
pattern that appears first in the machine description is the one used. 
Therefore, more specific patterns (patterns that will match fewer things)
and faster instructions (those that will produce better code when they
do match) should usually go first in the description.

<p>In some cases the effect of ordering the patterns can be used to hide
a pattern when it is not valid.  For example, the 68000 has an
instruction for converting a fullword to floating point and another
for converting a byte to floating point.  An instruction converting
an integer to floating point could match either one.  We put the
pattern to convert the fullword first to make sure that one will
be used rather than the other.  (Otherwise a large integer might
be generated as a single-byte immediate quantity, which would not work.) 
Instead of using this pattern ordering it would be possible to make the
pattern for convert-a-byte smart enough to deal properly with any
constant value.

<h2>Interdependence of Patterns</h2>

<p>Every machine description must have a named pattern for each of the
conditional branch names <code>b<var>cond</var></code>.  The recognition template
must always have the form

<pre>(set (pc)
     (if_then_else (<var>cond</var> (cc0) (const_int 0))
                   (label_ref (match_operand 0 "" ""))
                   (pc)))
</pre>

<p>In addition, every machine description must have an anonymous pattern
for each of the possible reverse-conditional branches.  Their templates
look like

<pre>(set (pc)
     (if_then_else (<var>cond</var> (cc0) (const_int 0))
                   (pc)
                   (label_ref (match_operand 0 "" ""))))
</pre>

<p>They are necessary because jump optimization can turn direct-conditional
branches into reverse-conditional branches.

<p>It is often convenient to use the <code>match_operator</code> construct to
reduce the number of patterns that must be specified for branches.  For
example,

<pre>(define_insn ""
  [(set (pc)
        (if_then_else (match_operator 0 "comparison_operator"
                                      [(cc0) (const_int 0)])
                      (pc)
                      (label_ref (match_operand 1 "" ""))))]
  "<var>condition</var>"
  "<small>...</small>")
</pre>

<p>In some cases machines support instructions identical except for the
machine mode of one or more operands.  For example, there may be
"sign-extend halfword" and "sign-extend byte" instructions whose
patterns are

<pre>(set (match_operand:SI 0 <small>...</small>)
     (extend:SI (match_operand:HI 1 <small>...</small>)))

(set (match_operand:SI 0 <small>...</small>)
     (extend:SI (match_operand:QI 1 <small>...</small>)))
</pre>

<p>Constant integers do not specify a machine mode, so an instruction to
extend a constant value could match either pattern.  The pattern it
actually will match is the one that appears first in the file.  For correct
results, this must be the one for the widest possible mode (<code>HImode</code>,
here).  If the pattern matches the <code>QImode</code> instruction, the results
will be incorrect if the constant value does not actually fit that mode.

<p>Such instructions to extend constants are rarely generated because they are
optimized away, but they do occasionally happen in nonoptimized
compilations.

<p>If a constraint in a pattern allows a constant, the reload pass may
replace a register with a constant permitted by the constraint in some
cases.  Similarly for memory references.  Because of this substitution,
you should not provide separate patterns for increment and decrement
instructions.  Instead, they should be generated from the same pattern
that supports register-register add insns by examining the operands and
generating the appropriate machine instruction.

<h2>Defining Jump Instruction Patterns</h2>

<p>For most machines, GNU CC assumes that the machine has a condition code. 
A comparison insn sets the condition code, recording the results of both
signed and unsigned comparison of the given operands.  A separate branch
insn tests the condition code and branches or not according its value. 
The branch insns come in distinct signed and unsigned flavors.  Many
common machines, such as the Vax, the 68000 and the 32000, work this
way.

<p>Some machines have distinct signed and unsigned compare instructions, and
only one set of conditional branch instructions.  The easiest way to handle
these machines is to treat them just like the others until the final stage
where assembly code is written.  At this time, when outputting code for the
compare instruction, peek ahead at the following branch using
<code>next_cc0_user (insn)</code>.  (The variable <code>insn</code> refers to the insn
being output, in the output-writing code in an instruction pattern.)  If
the RTL says that is an unsigned branch, output an unsigned compare;
otherwise output a signed compare.  When the branch itself is output, you
can treat signed and unsigned branches identically.

<p>The reason you can do this is that GNU CC always generates a pair of
consecutive RTL insns, possibly separated by <code>note</code> insns, one to
set the condition code and one to test it, and keeps the pair inviolate
until the end.

<p>To go with this technique, you must define the machine-description macro
<code>NOTICE_UPDATE_CC</code> to do <code>CC_STATUS_INIT</code>; in other words, no
compare instruction is superfluous.

<p>Some machines have compare-and-branch instructions and no condition code. 
A similar technique works for them.  When it is time to "output" a
compare instruction, record its operands in two static variables.  When
outputting the branch-on-condition-code instruction that follows, actually
output a compare-and-branch instruction that uses the remembered operands.

<p>It also works to define patterns for compare-and-branch instructions. 
In optimizing compilation, the pair of compare and branch instructions
will be combined according to these patterns.  But this does not happen
if optimization is not requested.  So you must use one of the solutions
above in addition to any special patterns you define.

<p>In many RISC machines, most instructions do not affect the condition
code and there may not even be a separate condition code register.  On
these machines, the restriction that the definition and use of the
condition code be adjacent insns is not necessary and can prevent
important optimizations.  For example, on the IBM RS/6000, there is a
delay for taken branches unless the condition code register is set three
instructions earlier than the conditional branch.  The instruction
scheduler cannot perform this optimization if it is not permitted to
separate the definition and use of the condition code register.

<p>On these machines, do not use <code>(cc0)</code>, but instead use a register
to represent the condition code.  If there is a specific condition code
register in the machine, use a hard register.  If the condition code or
comparison result can be placed in any general register, or if there are
multiple condition registers, use a pseudo register.

<p>On some machines, the type of branch instruction generated may depend on
the way the condition code was produced; for example, on the 68k and
Sparc, setting the condition code directly from an add or subtract
instruction does not clear the overflow bit the way that a test
instruction does, so a different branch instruction must be used for
some conditional branches.  For machines that use <code>(cc0)</code>, the set
and use of the condition code must be adjacent (separated only by
<code>note</code> insns) allowing flags in <code>cc_status</code> to be used. 
(See <a href="#Condition%20Code">Condition Code</a>.)  Also, the comparison and branch insns can be
located from each other by using the functions <code>prev_cc0_setter</code>
and <code>next_cc0_user</code>.

<p>However, this is not true on machines that do not use <code>(cc0)</code>.  On
those machines, no assumptions can be made about the adjacency of the
compare and branch insns and the above methods cannot be used.  Instead,
we use the machine mode of the condition code register to record
different formats of the condition code register.

<p>Registers used to store the condition code value should have a mode that
is in class <code>MODE_CC</code>.  Normally, it will be <code>CCmode</code>.  If
additional modes are required (as for the add example mentioned above in
the Sparc), define the macro <code>EXTRA_CC_MODES</code> to list the
additional modes required (see <a href="#Condition%20Code">Condition Code</a>).  Also define
<code>EXTRA_CC_NAMES</code> to list the names of those modes and
<code>SELECT_CC_MODE</code> to choose a mode given an operand of a compare.

<p>If it is known during RTL generation that a different mode will be
required (for example, if the machine has separate compare instructions
for signed and unsigned quantities, like most IBM processors), they can
be specified at that time.

<p>If the cases that require different modes would be made by instruction
combination, the macro <code>SELECT_CC_MODE</code> determines which machine
mode should be used for the comparison result.  The patterns should be
written using that mode.  To support the case of the add on the Sparc
discussed above, we have the pattern

<pre>(define_insn ""
  [(set (reg:CC_NOOV 0)
        (compare:CC_NOOV
          (plus:SI (match_operand:SI 0 "register_operand" "%r")
                   (match_operand:SI 1 "arith_operand" "rI"))
          (const_int 0)))]
  ""
  "<small>...</small>")
</pre>

<p>The <code>SELECT_CC_MODE</code> macro on the Sparc returns <code>CC_NOOVmode</code>
for comparisons whose argument is a <code>plus</code>.

<h2>Canonicalization of Instructions</h2>

<p>There are often cases where multiple RTL expressions could represent an
operation performed by a single machine instruction.  This situation is
most commonly encountered with logical, branch, and multiply-accumulate
instructions.  In such cases, the compiler attempts to convert these
multiple RTL expressions into a single canonical form to reduce the
number of insn patterns required.

<p>In addition to algebraic simplifications, following canonicalizations
are performed:

<ul>
<li>For commutative and comparison operators, a constant is always made the
second operand.  If a machine only supports a constant as the second
operand, only patterns that match a constant in the second operand need
be supplied.

<p>For these operators, if only one operand is a <code>neg</code>, <code>not</code>,
<code>mult</code>, <code>plus</code>, or <code>minus</code> expression, it will be the
first operand.

</p><li>For the <code>compare</code> operator, a constant is always the second operand
on machines where <code>cc0</code> is used (see <a href="#Jump%20Patterns">Jump Patterns</a>).  On other
machines, there are rare cases where the compiler might want to construct
a <code>compare</code> with a constant as the first operand.  However, these
cases are not common enough for it to be worthwhile to provide a pattern
matching a constant as the first operand unless the machine actually has
such an instruction.

<p>An operand of <code>neg</code>, <code>not</code>, <code>mult</code>, <code>plus</code>, or
<code>minus</code> is made the first operand under the same conditions as
above.

</p><li><code>(minus <var>x</var> (const_int <var>n</var>))</code> is converted to
<code>(plus <var>x</var> (const_int <var>-n</var>))</code>.

<li>Within address computations (i.e., inside <code>mem</code>), a left shift is
converted into the appropriate multiplication by a power of two.

<li>De`Morgan's Law is used to move bitwise negation inside a bitwise
logical-and or logical-or operation.  If this results in only one
operand being a <code>not</code> expression, it will be the first one.

<p>A machine that has an instruction that performs a bitwise logical-and of one
operand with the bitwise negation of the other should specify the pattern
for that instruction as

<pre>(define_insn ""
  [(set (match_operand:<var>m</var> 0 <small>...</small>)
        (and:<var>m</var> (not:<var>m</var> (match_operand:<var>m</var> 1 <small>...</small>))
                     (match_operand:<var>m</var> 2 <small>...</small>)))]
  "<small>...</small>"
  "<small>...</small>")
</pre>

<p>Similarly, a pattern for a "NAND" instruction should be written

<pre>(define_insn ""
  [(set (match_operand:<var>m</var> 0 <small>...</small>)
        (ior:<var>m</var> (not:<var>m</var> (match_operand:<var>m</var> 1 <small>...</small>))
                     (not:<var>m</var> (match_operand:<var>m</var> 2 <small>...</small>))))]
  "<small>...</small>"
  "<small>...</small>")
</pre>

<p>In both cases, it is not necessary to include patterns for the many
logically equivalent RTL expressions.

</p><li>The only possible RTL expressions involving both bitwise exclusive-or
and bitwise negation are <code>(xor:<var>m</var> <var>x</var> <var>y</var>)</code>
and <code>(not:<var>m</var> (xor:<var>m</var> <var>x</var> <var>y</var>))</code>.

<li>The sum of three items, one of which is a constant, will only appear in
the form

<pre>(plus:<var>m</var> (plus:<var>m</var> <var>x</var> <var>y</var>) <var>constant</var>)
</pre>

<li>On machines that do not use <code>cc0</code>,
<code>(compare <var>x</var> (const_int 0))</code> will be converted to
<var>x</var>.

<li>Equality comparisons of a group of bits (usually a single bit) with zero
will be written using <code>zero_extract</code> rather than the equivalent
<code>and</code> or <code>sign_extract</code> operations.

</ul>

<h2>Machine-Specific Peephole Optimizers</h2>

<p>In addition to instruction patterns the <code>md</code> file may contain
definitions of machine-specific peephole optimizations.

<p>The combiner does not notice certain peephole optimizations when the data
flow in the program does not suggest that it should try them.  For example,
sometimes two consecutive insns related in purpose can be combined even
though the second one does not appear to use a register computed in the
first one.  A machine-specific peephole optimizer can detect such
opportunities.

<p>A definition looks like this:

<pre>(define_peephole
  [<var>insn-pattern-1</var>
   <var>insn-pattern-2</var>
   <small>...</small>]
  "<var>condition</var>"
  "<var>template</var>"
  "<var>optional insn-attributes</var>")
</pre>

<p>The last string operand may be omitted if you are not using any
machine-specific information in this machine description.  If present,
it must obey the same rules as in a <code>define_insn</code>.

<p>In this skeleton, <var>insn-pattern-1</var> and so on are patterns to match
consecutive insns.  The optimization applies to a sequence of insns when
<var>insn-pattern-1</var> matches the first one, <var>insn-pattern-2</var> matches
the next, and so on.

<p>Each of the insns matched by a peephole must also match a
<code>define_insn</code>.  Peepholes are checked only at the last stage just
before code generation, and only optionally.  Therefore, any insn which
would match a peephole but no <code>define_insn</code> will cause a crash in code
generation in an unoptimized compilation, or at various optimization
stages.

<p>The operands of the insns are matched with <code>match_operands</code>,
<code>match_operator</code>, and <code>match_dup</code>, as usual.  What is not
usual is that the operand numbers apply to all the insn patterns in the
definition.  So, you can check for identical operands in two insns by
using <code>match_operand</code> in one insn and <code>match_dup</code> in the
other.

<p>The operand constraints used in <code>match_operand</code> patterns do not have
any direct effect on the applicability of the peephole, but they will
be validated afterward, so make sure your constraints are general enough
to apply whenever the peephole matches.  If the peephole matches
but the constraints are not satisfied, the compiler will crash.

<p>It is safe to omit constraints in all the operands of the peephole; or
you can write constraints which serve as a double-check on the criteria
previously tested.

<p>Once a sequence of insns matches the patterns, the <var>condition</var> is
checked.  This is a C expression which makes the final decision whether to
perform the optimization (we do so if the expression is nonzero).  If
<var>condition</var> is omitted (in other words, the string is empty) then the
optimization is applied to every sequence of insns that matches the
patterns.

<p>The defined peephole optimizations are applied after register allocation
is complete.  Therefore, the peephole definition can check which
operands have ended up in which kinds of registers, just by looking at
the operands.

<p>The way to refer to the operands in <var>condition</var> is to write
<code>operands[<var>i</var>]</code> for operand number <var>i</var> (as matched by
<code>(match_operand <var>i</var> <small>...</small>)</code>).  Use the variable <code>insn</code>
to refer to the last of the insns being matched; use
<code>prev_active_insn</code> to find the preceding insns.

<p>When optimizing computations with intermediate results, you can use
<var>condition</var> to match only when the intermediate results are not used
elsewhere.  Use the C expression <code>dead_or_set_p (<var>insn</var>,
<var>op</var>)</code>, where <var>insn</var> is the insn in which you expect the value
to be used for the last time (from the value of <code>insn</code>, together
with use of <code>prev_nonnote_insn</code>), and <var>op</var> is the intermediate
value (from <code>operands[<var>i</var>]</code>).

<p>Applying the optimization means replacing the sequence of insns with one
new insn.  The <var>template</var> controls ultimate output of assembler code
for this combined insn.  It works exactly like the template of a
<code>define_insn</code>.  Operand numbers in this template are the same ones
used in matching the original sequence of insns.

<p>The result of a defined peephole optimizer does not need to match any of
the insn patterns in the machine description; it does not even have an
opportunity to match them.  The peephole optimizer definition itself serves
as the insn pattern to control how the insn is output.

<p>Defined peephole optimizers are run as assembler code is being output,
so the insns they produce are never combined or rearranged in any way.

<p>Here is an example, taken from the 68000 machine description:

<pre>(define_peephole
  [(set (reg:SI 15) (plus:SI (reg:SI 15) (const_int 4)))
   (set (match_operand:DF 0 "register_operand" "=f")
        (match_operand:DF 1 "register_operand" "ad"))]
  "FP_REG_P (operands[0]) &amp;&amp; ! FP_REG_P (operands[1])"
  "*
{
  rtx xoperands[2];
  xoperands[1] = gen_rtx (REG, SImode, REGNO (operands[1]) + 1);
#ifdef MOTOROLA
  output_asm_insn (\"move.l %1,(sp)\", xoperands);
  output_asm_insn (\"move.l %1,-(sp)\", operands);
  return \"fmove.d (sp)+,%0\";
#else
  output_asm_insn (\"movel %1,sp@\", xoperands);
  output_asm_insn (\"movel %1,sp@-\", operands);
  return \"fmoved sp@+,%0\";
#endif
}
")
</pre>

<p>The effect of this optimization is to change

<pre>jbsr _foobar
addql #4,sp
movel d1,sp@-
movel d0,sp@-
fmoved sp@+,fp0
</pre>

<p>into

<pre>jbsr _foobar
movel d1,sp@
movel d0,sp@-
fmoved sp@+,fp0
</pre>

<p><var>insn-pattern-1</var> and so on look <em>almost</em> like the second
operand of <code>define_insn</code>.  There is one important difference: the
second operand of <code>define_insn</code> consists of one or more RTX's
enclosed in square brackets.  Usually, there is only one: then the same
action can be written as an element of a <code>define_peephole</code>.  But
when there are multiple actions in a <code>define_insn</code>, they are
implicitly enclosed in a <code>parallel</code>.  Then you must explicitly
write the <code>parallel</code>, and the square brackets within it, in the
<code>define_peephole</code>.  Thus, if an insn pattern looks like this,

<pre>(define_insn "divmodsi4"
  [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "=d")
        (div:SI (match_operand:SI 1 "general_operand" "0")
                (match_operand:SI 2 "general_operand" "dmsK")))
   (set (match_operand:SI 3 "general_operand" "=d")
        (mod:SI (match_dup 1) (match_dup 2)))]
  "TARGET_68020"
  "divsl%.l %2,%3:%0")
</pre>

<p>then the way to mention this insn in a peephole is as follows:

<pre>(define_peephole
  [<small>...</small>
   (parallel
    [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "=d")
          (div:SI (match_operand:SI 1 "general_operand" "0")
                  (match_operand:SI 2 "general_operand" "dmsK")))
     (set (match_operand:SI 3 "general_operand" "=d")
          (mod:SI (match_dup 1) (match_dup 2)))])
   <small>...</small>]
  <small>...</small>)
</pre>

<h2>Defining RTL Sequences for Code Generation</h2>

<p>On some target machines, some standard pattern names for RTL generation
cannot be handled with single insn, but a sequence of RTL insns can
represent them.  For these target machines, you can write a
<code>define_expand</code> to specify how to generate the sequence of RTL.

<p>A <code>define_expand</code> is an RTL expression that looks almost like a
<code>define_insn</code>; but, unlike the latter, a <code>define_expand</code> is used
only for RTL generation and it can produce more than one RTL insn.

<p>A <code>define_expand</code> RTX has four operands:

<ul>
<li>The name.  Each <code>define_expand</code> must have a name, since the only
use for it is to refer to it by name.

<li>The RTL template.  This is just like the RTL template for a
<code>define_peephole</code> in that it is a vector of RTL expressions
each being one insn.

<li>The condition, a string containing a C expression.  This expression is
used to express how the availability of this pattern depends on
subclasses of target machine, selected by command-line options when GNU
CC is run.  This is just like the condition of a <code>define_insn</code> that
has a standard name.  Therefore, the condition (if present) may not
depend on the data in the insn being matched, but only the
target-machine-type flags.  The compiler needs to test these conditions
during initialization in order to learn exactly which named instructions
are available in a particular run.

<li>The preparation statements, a string containing zero or more C
statements which are to be executed before RTL code is generated from
the RTL template.

<p>Usually these statements prepare temporary registers for use as
internal operands in the RTL template, but they can also generate RTL
insns directly by calling routines such as <code>emit_insn</code>, etc. 
Any such insns precede the ones that come from the RTL template. 
</ul>

<p>Every RTL insn emitted by a <code>define_expand</code> must match some
<code>define_insn</code> in the machine description.  Otherwise, the compiler
will crash when trying to generate code for the insn or trying to optimize
it.

<p>The RTL template, in addition to controlling generation of RTL insns,
also describes the operands that need to be specified when this pattern
is used.  In particular, it gives a predicate for each operand.

<p>A true operand, which needs to be specified in order to generate RTL from
the pattern, should be described with a <code>match_operand</code> in its first
occurrence in the RTL template.  This enters information on the operand's
predicate into the tables that record such things.  GNU CC uses the
information to preload the operand into a register if that is required for
valid RTL code.  If the operand is referred to more than once, subsequent
references should use <code>match_dup</code>.

<p>The RTL template may also refer to internal "operands" which are
temporary registers or labels used only within the sequence made by the
<code>define_expand</code>.  Internal operands are substituted into the RTL
template with <code>match_dup</code>, never with <code>match_operand</code>.  The
values of the internal operands are not passed in as arguments by the
compiler when it requests use of this pattern.  Instead, they are computed
within the pattern, in the preparation statements.  These statements
compute the values and store them into the appropriate elements of
<code>operands</code> so that <code>match_dup</code> can find them.

<p>There are two special macros defined for use in the preparation statements:
<code>DONE</code> and <code>FAIL</code>.  Use them with a following semicolon,
as a statement.

<dl>

<br><dt><code>DONE</code>
<dd>Use the <code>DONE</code> macro to end RTL generation for the pattern.  The
only RTL insns resulting from the pattern on this occasion will be
those already emitted by explicit calls to <code>emit_insn</code> within the
preparation statements; the RTL template will not be generated.

<br><dt><code>FAIL</code>
<dd>Make the pattern fail on this occasion.  When a pattern fails, it means
that the pattern was not truly available.  The calling routines in the
compiler will try other strategies for code generation using other patterns.

<p>Failure is currently supported only for binary (addition, multiplication,
shifting, etc.) and bitfield (<code>extv</code>, <code>extzv</code>, and <code>insv</code>)
operations. 
</dl>

<p>Here is an example, the definition of left-shift for the SPUR chip:

<pre>(define_expand "ashlsi3"
  [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "register_operand" "")
        (ashift:SI
          (match_operand:SI 1 "register_operand" "")
          (match_operand:SI 2 "nonmemory_operand" "")))]
  ""
  "
</pre>

<pre>{
  if (GET_CODE (operands[2]) != CONST_INT
      || (unsigned) INTVAL (operands[2]) &gt; 3)
    FAIL;
}")
</pre>

<p>This example uses <code>define_expand</code> so that it can generate an RTL insn
for shifting when the shift-count is in the supported range of 0 to 3 but
fail in other cases where machine insns aren't available.  When it fails,
the compiler tries another strategy using different patterns (such as, a
library call).

<p>If the compiler were able to handle nontrivial condition-strings in
patterns with names, then it would be possible to use a
<code>define_insn</code> in that case.  Here is another case (zero-extension
on the 68000) which makes more use of the power of <code>define_expand</code>:

<pre>(define_expand "zero_extendhisi2"
  [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "")
        (const_int 0))
   (set (strict_low_part
          (subreg:HI
            (match_dup 0)
            0))
        (match_operand:HI 1 "general_operand" ""))]
  ""
  "operands[1] = make_safe_from (operands[1], operands[0]);")
</pre>

<p>Here two RTL insns are generated, one to clear the entire output operand
and the other to copy the input operand into its low half.  This sequence
is incorrect if the input operand refers to [the old value of] the output
operand, so the preparation statement makes sure this isn't so.  The
function <code>make_safe_from</code> copies the <code>operands[1]</code> into a
temporary register if it refers to <code>operands[0]</code>.  It does this
by emitting another RTL insn.

<p>Finally, a third example shows the use of an internal operand. 
Zero-extension on the SPUR chip is done by <code>and</code>-ing the result
against a halfword mask.  But this mask cannot be represented by a
<code>const_int</code> because the constant value is too large to be legitimate
on this machine.  So it must be copied into a register with
<code>force_reg</code> and then the register used in the <code>and</code>.

<pre>(define_expand "zero_extendhisi2"
  [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "register_operand" "")
        (and:SI (subreg:SI
                  (match_operand:HI 1 "register_operand" "")
                  0)
                (match_dup 2)))]
  ""
  "operands[2]
     = force_reg (SImode, GEN_INT (65535)); ")
</pre>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> If the <code>define_expand</code> is used to serve a
standard binary or unary arithmetic operation or a bitfield operation,
then the last insn it generates must not be a <code>code_label</code>,
<code>barrier</code> or <code>note</code>.  It must be an <code>insn</code>,
<code>jump_insn</code> or <code>call_insn</code>.  If you don't need a real insn
at the end, emit an insn to copy the result of the operation into
itself.  Such an insn will generate no code, but it can avoid problems
in the compiler.

<h2>Defining How to Split Instructions</h2>

<p>There are two cases where you should specify how to split a pattern into
multiple insns.  On machines that have instructions requiring delay
slots (see <a href="#Delay%20Slots">Delay Slots</a>) or that have instructions whose output is
not available for multiple cycles (see <a href="#Function%20Units">Function Units</a>), the compiler
phases that optimize these cases need to be able to move insns into
one-instruction delay slots.  However, some insns may generate more than one
machine instruction.  These insns cannot be placed into a delay slot.

<p>Often you can rewrite the single insn as a list of individual insns,
each corresponding to one machine instruction.  The disadvantage of
doing so is that it will cause the compilation to be slower and require
more space.  If the resulting insns are too complex, it may also
suppress some optimizations.  The compiler splits the insn if there is a
reason to believe that it might improve instruction or delay slot
scheduling.

<p>The insn combiner phase also splits putative insns.  If three insns are
merged into one insn with a complex expression that cannot be matched by
some <code>define_insn</code> pattern, the combiner phase attempts to split
the complex pattern into two insns that are recognized.  Usually it can
break the complex pattern into two patterns by splitting out some
subexpression.  However, in some other cases, such as performing an
addition of a large constant in two insns on a RISC machine, the way to
split the addition into two insns is machine-dependent.

<p>The <code>define_split</code> definition tells the compiler how to split a
complex insn into several simpler insns.  It looks like this:

<pre>(define_split
  [<var>insn-pattern</var>]
  "<var>condition</var>"
  [<var>new-insn-pattern-1</var>
   <var>new-insn-pattern-2</var>
   <small>...</small>]
  "<var>preparation statements</var>")
</pre>

<p><var>insn-pattern</var> is a pattern that needs to be split and
<var>condition</var> is the final condition to be tested, as in a
<code>define_insn</code>.  When an insn matching <var>insn-pattern</var> and
satisfying <var>condition</var> is found, it is replaced in the insn list
with the insns given by <var>new-insn-pattern-1</var>,
<var>new-insn-pattern-2</var>, etc.

<p>The <var>preparation statements</var> are similar to those statements that
are specified for <code>define_expand</code> (see <a href="#Expander%20Definitions">Expander Definitions</a>)
and are executed before the new RTL is generated to prepare for the
generated code or emit some insns whose pattern is not fixed.  Unlike
those in <code>define_expand</code>, however, these statements must not
generate any new pseudo-registers.  Once reload has completed, they also
must not allocate any space in the stack frame.

<p>Patterns are matched against <var>insn-pattern</var> in two different
circumstances.  If an insn needs to be split for delay slot scheduling
or insn scheduling, the insn is already known to be valid, which means
that it must have been matched by some <code>define_insn</code> and, if
<code>reload_completed</code> is non-zero, is known to satisfy the constraints
of that <code>define_insn</code>.  In that case, the new insn patterns must
also be insns that are matched by some <code>define_insn</code> and, if
<code>reload_completed</code> is non-zero, must also satisfy the constraints
of those definitions.

<p>As an example of this usage of <code>define_split</code>, consider the following
example from <code>a29k.md</code>, which splits a <code>sign_extend</code> from
<code>HImode</code> to <code>SImode</code> into a pair of shift insns:

<pre>(define_split
  [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "gen_reg_operand" "")
        (sign_extend:SI (match_operand:HI 1 "gen_reg_operand" "")))]
  ""
  [(set (match_dup 0)
        (ashift:SI (match_dup 1)
                   (const_int 16)))
   (set (match_dup 0)
        (ashiftrt:SI (match_dup 0)
                     (const_int 16)))]
  "
{ operands[1] = gen_lowpart (SImode, operands[1]); }")
</pre>

<p>When the combiner phase tries to split an insn pattern, it is always the
case that the pattern is <em>not</em> matched by any <code>define_insn</code>. 
The combiner pass first tries to split a single <code>set</code> expression
and then the same <code>set</code> expression inside a <code>parallel</code>, but
followed by a <code>clobber</code> of a pseudo-reg to use as a scratch
register.  In these cases, the combiner expects exactly two new insn
patterns to be generated.  It will verify that these patterns match some
<code>define_insn</code> definitions, so you need not do this test in the
<code>define_split</code> (of course, there is no point in writing a
<code>define_split</code> that will never produce insns that match).

<p>Here is an example of this use of <code>define_split</code>, taken from
<code>rs6000.md</code>:

<pre>(define_split
  [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "gen_reg_operand" "")
        (plus:SI (match_operand:SI 1 "gen_reg_operand" "")
                 (match_operand:SI 2 "non_add_cint_operand" "")))]
  ""
  [(set (match_dup 0) (plus:SI (match_dup 1) (match_dup 3)))
   (set (match_dup 0) (plus:SI (match_dup 0) (match_dup 4)))]
"
{
  int low = INTVAL (operands[2]) &amp; 0xffff;
  int high = (unsigned) INTVAL (operands[2]) &gt;&gt; 16;

  if (low &amp; 0x8000)
    high++, low |= 0xffff0000;

  operands[3] = GEN_INT (high &lt;&lt; 16);
  operands[4] = GEN_INT (low);
}")
</pre>

<p>Here the predicate <code>non_add_cint_operand</code> matches any
<code>const_int</code> that is <em>not</em> a valid operand of a single add
insn.  The add with the smaller displacement is written so that it
can be substituted into the address of a subsequent operation.

<p>An example that uses a scratch register, from the same file, generates
an equality comparison of a register and a large constant:

<pre>(define_split
  [(set (match_operand:CC 0 "cc_reg_operand" "")
        (compare:CC (match_operand:SI 1 "gen_reg_operand" "")
                    (match_operand:SI 2 "non_short_cint_operand" "")))
   (clobber (match_operand:SI 3 "gen_reg_operand" ""))]
  "find_single_use (operands[0], insn, 0)
   &amp;&amp; (GET_CODE (*find_single_use (operands[0], insn, 0)) == EQ
       || GET_CODE (*find_single_use (operands[0], insn, 0)) == NE)"
  [(set (match_dup 3) (xor:SI (match_dup 1) (match_dup 4)))
   (set (match_dup 0) (compare:CC (match_dup 3) (match_dup 5)))]
  "
{
  /* Get the constant we are comparing against, C, and see what it
     looks like sign-extended to 16 bits.  Then see what constant
     could be XOR'ed with C to get the sign-extended value.  */

  int c = INTVAL (operands[2]);
  int sextc = (c &lt;&lt; 16) &gt;&gt; 16;
  int xorv = c ^ sextc;

  operands[4] = GEN_INT (xorv);
  operands[5] = GEN_INT (sextc);
}")
</pre>

<p>To avoid confusion, don't write a single <code>define_split</code> that
accepts some insns that match some <code>define_insn</code> as well as some
insns that don't.  Instead, write two separate <code>define_split</code>
definitions, one for the insns that are valid and one for the insns that
are not valid.

<h2>Instruction Attributes</h2>

<p>In addition to describing the instruction supported by the target machine,
the <code>md</code> file also defines a group of <dfn>attributes</dfn> and a set of
values for each.  Every generated insn is assigned a value for each attribute. 
One possible attribute would be the effect that the insn has on the machine's
condition code.  This attribute can then be used by <code>NOTICE_UPDATE_CC</code>

<h3>Defining Attributes and their Values</h3>

<p>The <code>define_attr</code> expression is used to define each attribute required
by the target machine.  It looks like:

<pre>(define_attr <var>name</var> <var>list-of-values</var> <var>default</var>)
</pre>

<p><var>name</var> is a string specifying the name of the attribute being defined.

<p><var>list-of-values</var> is either a string that specifies a comma-separated
list of values that can be assigned to the attribute, or a null string to
indicate that the attribute takes numeric values.

<p><var>default</var> is an attribute expression that gives the value of this
attribute for insns that match patterns whose definition does not include
an explicit value for this attribute.  See <a href="#Attr%20Example">Attr Example</a>, for more
information on the handling of defaults.  See <a href="#Constant%20Attributes">Constant Attributes</a>,
for information on attributes that do not depend on any particular insn.

<p>For each defined attribute, a number of definitions are written to the
<code>insn-attr.h</code> file.  For cases where an explicit set of values is
specified for an attribute, the following are defined:

<ul>
<li>A <code>#define</code> is written for the symbol <code>HAVE_ATTR_<var>name</var></code>.

<li>An enumeral class is defined for <code>attr_<var>name</var></code> with
elements of the form <code><var>upper-name</var>_<var>upper-value</var></code> where
the attribute name and value are first converted to upper case.

<li>A function <code>get_attr_<var>name</var></code> is defined that is passed an insn and
returns the attribute value for that insn. 
</ul>

<p>For example, if the following is present in the <code>md</code> file:

<pre>(define_attr "type" "branch,fp,load,store,arith" <small>...</small>)
</pre>

<p>the following lines will be written to the file <code>insn-attr.h</code>.

<pre>#define HAVE_ATTR_type
enum attr_type {TYPE_BRANCH, TYPE_FP, TYPE_LOAD,
                 TYPE_STORE, TYPE_ARITH};
extern enum attr_type get_attr_type ();
</pre>

<p>If the attribute takes numeric values, no <code>enum</code> type will be
defined and the function to obtain the attribute's value will return
<code>int</code>.

<br>

<h3>Attribute Expressions</h3>

<p>RTL expressions used to define attributes use the codes described above
plus a few specific to attribute definitions, to be discussed below. 
Attribute value expressions must have one of the following forms:

<dl>
<dt><code>(const_int <var>i</var>)</code>
<dd>The integer <var>i</var> specifies the value of a numeric attribute.  <var>i</var>
must be non-negative.

<p>The value of a numeric attribute can be specified either with a
<code>const_int</code>, or as an integer represented as a string in
<code>const_string</code>, <code>eq_attr</code> (see below), <code>attr</code>,
<code>symbol_ref</code>, simple arithmetic expressions, and <code>set_attr</code>
overrides on specific instructions (see <a href="#Tagging%20Insns">Tagging Insns</a>).

<br><dt><code>(const_string <var>value</var>)</code>
<dd>The string <var>value</var> specifies a constant attribute value. 
If <var>value</var> is specified as <code>"*"</code>, it means that the default value of
the attribute is to be used for the insn containing this expression. 
<code>"*"</code> obviously cannot be used in the <var>default</var> expression
of a <code>define_attr</code>.

<p>If the attribute whose value is being specified is numeric, <var>value</var>
must be a string containing a non-negative integer (normally
<code>const_int</code> would be used in this case).  Otherwise, it must
contain one of the valid values for the attribute.

<br><dt><code>(if_then_else <var>test</var> <var>true-value</var> <var>false-value</var>)</code>
<dd><var>test</var> specifies an attribute test, whose format is defined below. 
The value of this expression is <var>true-value</var> if <var>test</var> is true,
otherwise it is <var>false-value</var>.

<br><dt><code>(cond [<var>test1</var> <var>value1</var> <small>...</small>] <var>default</var>)</code>
<dd>The first operand of this expression is a vector containing an even
number of expressions and consisting of pairs of <var>test</var> and <var>value</var>
expressions.  The value of the <code>cond</code> expression is that of the
<var>value</var> corresponding to the first true <var>test</var> expression.  If
none of the <var>test</var> expressions are true, the value of the <code>cond</code>
expression is that of the <var>default</var> expression. 
</dl>

<p><var>test</var> expressions can have one of the following forms:

<dl>
<dt><code>(const_int <var>i</var>)</code>
<dd>This test is true if <var>i</var> is non-zero and false otherwise.

<br><dt><code>(not <var>test</var>)</code>
<dt><code>(ior <var>test1</var> <var>test2</var>)</code>
<dt><code>(and <var>test1</var> <var>test2</var>)</code>
<dd>These tests are true if the indicated logical function is true.

<br><dt><code>(match_operand:<var>m</var> <var>n</var> <var>pred</var> <var>constraints</var>)</code>
<dd>This test is true if operand <var>n</var> of the insn whose attribute value
is being determined has mode <var>m</var> (this part of the test is ignored
if <var>m</var> is <code>VOIDmode</code>) and the function specified by the string
<var>pred</var> returns a non-zero value when passed operand <var>n</var> and mode
<var>m</var> (this part of the test is ignored if <var>pred</var> is the null
string).

<p>The <var>constraints</var> operand is ignored and should be the null string.

<br><dt><code>(le <var>arith1</var> <var>arith2</var>)</code>
<dt><code>(leu <var>arith1</var> <var>arith2</var>)</code>
<dt><code>(lt <var>arith1</var> <var>arith2</var>)</code>
<dt><code>(ltu <var>arith1</var> <var>arith2</var>)</code>
<dt><code>(gt <var>arith1</var> <var>arith2</var>)</code>
<dt><code>(gtu <var>arith1</var> <var>arith2</var>)</code>
<dt><code>(ge <var>arith1</var> <var>arith2</var>)</code>
<dt><code>(geu <var>arith1</var> <var>arith2</var>)</code>
<dt><code>(ne <var>arith1</var> <var>arith2</var>)</code>
<dt><code>(eq <var>arith1</var> <var>arith2</var>)</code>
<dd>These tests are true if the indicated comparison of the two arithmetic
expressions is true.  Arithmetic expressions are formed with
<code>plus</code>, <code>minus</code>, <code>mult</code>, <code>div</code>, <code>mod</code>,
<code>abs</code>, <code>neg</code>, <code>and</code>, <code>ior</code>, <code>xor</code>, <code>not</code>,
<code>ashift</code>, <code>lshiftrt</code>, and <code>ashiftrt</code> expressions.

<p><code>const_int</code> and <code>symbol_ref</code> are always valid terms (see <a href="#Insn%20Lengths">Insn Lengths</a>,for additional forms).  <code>symbol_ref</code> is a string
denoting a C expression that yields an <code>int</code> when evaluated by the
<code>get_attr_<small>...</small></code> routine.  It should normally be a global
variable.

<br><dt><code>(eq_attr <var>name</var> <var>value</var>)</code>
<dd><var>name</var> is a string specifying the name of an attribute.

<p><var>value</var> is a string that is either a valid value for attribute
<var>name</var>, a comma-separated list of values, or <code>!</code> followed by a
value or list.  If <var>value</var> does not begin with a <code>!</code>, this
test is true if the value of the <var>name</var> attribute of the current
insn is in the list specified by <var>value</var>.  If <var>value</var> begins
with a <code>!</code>, this test is true if the attribute's value is
<em>not</em> in the specified list.

<p>For example,

<pre>(eq_attr "type" "load,store")
</pre>

<p>is equivalent to

<pre>(ior (eq_attr "type" "load") (eq_attr "type" "store"))
</pre>

<p>If <var>name</var> specifies an attribute of <code>alternative</code>, it refers to the
value of the compiler variable <code>which_alternative</code>
(see <a href="#Output%20Statement">Output Statement</a>) and the values must be small integers.  For
example,

<pre>(eq_attr "alternative" "2,3")
</pre>

<p>is equivalent to

<pre>(ior (eq (symbol_ref "which_alternative") (const_int 2))
     (eq (symbol_ref "which_alternative") (const_int 3)))
</pre>

<p>Note that, for most attributes, an <code>eq_attr</code> test is simplified in cases
where the value of the attribute being tested is known for all insns matching
a particular pattern.  This is by far the most common case.

<br><dt><code>(attr_flag <var>name</var>)</code>
<dd>The value of an <code>attr_flag</code> expression is true if the flag
specified by <var>name</var> is true for the <code>insn</code> currently being
scheduled.

<p><var>name</var> is a string specifying one of a fixed set of flags to test. 
Test the flags <code>forward</code> and <code>backward</code> to determine the
direction of a conditional branch.  Test the flags <code>very_likely</code>,
<code>likely</code>, <code>very_unlikely</code>, and <code>unlikely</code> to determine
if a conditional branch is expected to be taken.

<p>If the <code>very_likely</code> flag is true, then the <code>likely</code> flag is also
true.  Likewise for the <code>very_unlikely</code> and <code>unlikely</code> flags.

<p>This example describes a conditional branch delay slot which
can be nullified for forward branches that are taken (annul-true) or
for backward branches which are not taken (annul-false).

<pre>(define_delay (eq_attr "type" "cbranch")
  [(eq_attr "in_branch_delay" "true")
   (and (eq_attr "in_branch_delay" "true")
        (attr_flag "forward"))
   (and (eq_attr "in_branch_delay" "true")
        (attr_flag "backward"))])
</pre>

<p>The <code>forward</code> and <code>backward</code> flags are false if the current
<code>insn</code> being scheduled is not a conditional branch.

<p>The <code>very_likely</code> and <code>likely</code> flags are true if the
<code>insn</code> being scheduled is not a conditional branch. 
The <code>very_unlikely</code> and <code>unlikely</code> flags are false if the
<code>insn</code> being scheduled is not a conditional branch.

<p><code>attr_flag</code> is only used during delay slot scheduling and has no
meaning to other passes of the compiler.

<br><dt><code>(attr <var>name</var>)</code>
<dd>The value of another attribute is returned.  This is most useful
for numeric attributes, as <code>eq_attr</code> and <code>attr_flag</code>
produce more efficient code for non-numeric attributes.

<h3>Assigning Attribute Values to Insns</h3>

<p>The value assigned to an attribute of an insn is primarily determined by
which pattern is matched by that insn (or which <code>define_peephole</code>
generated it).  Every <code>define_insn</code> and <code>define_peephole</code> can
have an optional last argument to specify the values of attributes for
matching insns.  The value of any attribute not specified in a particular
insn is set to the default value for that attribute, as specified in its
<code>define_attr</code>.  Extensive use of default values for attributes
permits the specification of the values for only one or two attributes
in the definition of most insn patterns, as seen in the example in the
next section.

<p>The optional last argument of <code>define_insn</code> and
<code>define_peephole</code> is a vector of expressions, each of which defines
the value for a single attribute.  The most general way of assigning an
attribute's value is to use a <code>set</code> expression whose first operand is an
<code>attr</code> expression giving the name of the attribute being set.  The
second operand of the <code>set</code> is an attribute expression
(see <a href="#Expressions">Expressions</a>) giving the value of the attribute.

<p>When the attribute value depends on the <code>alternative</code> attribute
(i.e., which is the applicable alternative in the constraint of the
insn), the <code>set_attr_alternative</code> expression can be used.  It
allows the specification of a vector of attribute expressions, one for
each alternative.

<p>When the generality of arbitrary attribute expressions is not required,
the simpler <code>set_attr</code> expression can be used, which allows
specifying a string giving either a single attribute value or a list
of attribute values, one for each alternative.

<p>The form of each of the above specifications is shown below.  In each case,
<var>name</var> is a string specifying the attribute to be set.

<dl>
<dt><code>(set_attr <var>name</var> <var>value-string</var>)</code>
<dd><var>value-string</var> is either a string giving the desired attribute value,
or a string containing a comma-separated list giving the values for
succeeding alternatives.  The number of elements must match the number
of alternatives in the constraint of the insn pattern.

<p>Note that it may be useful to specify <code>*</code> for some alternative, in
which case the attribute will assume its default value for insns matching
that alternative.

<br><dt><code>(set_attr_alternative <var>name</var> [<var>value1</var> <var>value2</var> <small>...</small>])</code>
<dd>Depending on the alternative of the insn, the value will be one of the
specified values.  This is a shorthand for using a <code>cond</code> with
tests on the <code>alternative</code> attribute.

<br><dt><code>(set (attr <var>name</var>) <var>value</var>)</code>
<dd>The first operand of this <code>set</code> must be the special RTL expression
<code>attr</code>, whose sole operand is a string giving the name of the
attribute being set.  <var>value</var> is the value of the attribute. 
</dl>

<p>The following shows three different ways of representing the same
attribute value specification:

<pre>(set_attr "type" "load,store,arith")

(set_attr_alternative "type"
                      [(const_string "load") (const_string "store")
                       (const_string "arith")])

(set (attr "type")
     (cond [(eq_attr "alternative" "1") (const_string "load")
            (eq_attr "alternative" "2") (const_string "store")]
           (const_string "arith")))
</pre>

<p>The <code>define_asm_attributes</code> expression provides a mechanism to
specify the attributes assigned to insns produced from an <code>asm</code>
statement.  It has the form:

<pre>(define_asm_attributes [<var>attr-sets</var>])
</pre>

<p>where <var>attr-sets</var> is specified the same as for both the
<code>define_insn</code> and the <code>define_peephole</code> expressions.

<p>These values will typically be the "worst case" attribute values.  For
example, they might indicate that the condition code will be clobbered.

<p>A specification for a <code>length</code> attribute is handled specially.  The
way to compute the length of an <code>asm</code> insn is to multiply the
length specified in the expression <code>define_asm_attributes</code> by the
number of machine instructions specified in the <code>asm</code> statement,
determined by counting the number of semicolons and newlines in the
string.  Therefore, the value of the <code>length</code> attribute specified
in a <code>define_asm_attributes</code> should be the maximum possible length
of a single machine instruction.

<h3>Example of Attribute Specifications</h3>

<p>The judicious use of defaulting is important in the efficient use of
insn attributes.  Typically, insns are divided into <dfn>types</dfn> and an
attribute, customarily called <code>type</code>, is used to represent this
value.  This attribute is normally used only to define the default value
for other attributes.  An example will clarify this usage.

<p>Assume we have a RISC machine with a condition code and in which only
full-word operations are performed in registers.  Let us assume that we
can divide all insns into loads, stores, (integer) arithmetic
operations, floating point operations, and branches.

<p>Here we will concern ourselves with determining the effect of an insn on
the condition code and will limit ourselves to the following possible
effects:  The condition code can be set unpredictably (clobbered), not
be changed, be set to agree with the results of the operation, or only
changed if the item previously set into the condition code has been
modified.

<p>Here is part of a sample <code>md</code> file for such a machine:

<pre>(define_attr "type" "load,store,arith,fp,branch" (const_string "arith"))

(define_attr "cc" "clobber,unchanged,set,change0"
             (cond [(eq_attr "type" "load")
                        (const_string "change0")
                    (eq_attr "type" "store,branch")
                        (const_string "unchanged")
                    (eq_attr "type" "arith")
                        (if_then_else (match_operand:SI 0 "" "")
                                      (const_string "set")
                                      (const_string "clobber"))]
                   (const_string "clobber")))

(define_insn ""
  [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "=r,r,m")
        (match_operand:SI 1 "general_operand" "r,m,r"))]
  ""
  "@
   move %0,%1
   load %0,%1
   store %0,%1"
  [(set_attr "type" "arith,load,store")])
</pre>

<p>Note that we assume in the above example that arithmetic operations
performed on quantities smaller than a machine word clobber the condition
code since they will set the condition code to a value corresponding to the
full-word result.

<h3>Computing the Length of an Insn</h3>

<p>For many machines, multiple types of branch instructions are provided, each
for different length branch displacements.  In most cases, the assembler
will choose the correct instruction to use.  However, when the assembler
cannot do so, GCC can when a special attribute, the <code>length</code>
attribute, is defined.  This attribute must be defined to have numeric
values by specifying a null string in its <code>define_attr</code>.

<p>In the case of the <code>length</code> attribute, two additional forms of
arithmetic terms are allowed in test expressions:

<dl>
<dt><code>(match_dup <var>n</var>)</code>
<dd>This refers to the address of operand <var>n</var> of the current insn, which
must be a <code>label_ref</code>.

<br><dt><code>(pc)</code>
<dd>This refers to the address of the <em>current</em> insn.  It might have
been more consistent with other usage to make this the address of the
<em>next</em> insn but this would be confusing because the length of the
current insn is to be computed. 
</dl>

<p>For normal insns, the length will be determined by value of the
<code>length</code> attribute.  In the case of <code>addr_vec</code> and
<code>addr_diff_vec</code> insn patterns, the length is computed as
the number of vectors multiplied by the size of each vector.

<p>Lengths are measured in addressable storage units (bytes).

<p>The following macros can be used to refine the length computation:

<dl>
<dt><code>FIRST_INSN_ADDRESS</code>
<dd>When the <code>length</code> insn attribute is used, this macro specifies the
value to be assigned to the address of the first insn in a function.  If
not specified, 0 is used.

<br><dt><code>ADJUST_INSN_LENGTH (<var>insn</var>, <var>length</var>)</code>
<dd>If defined, modifies the length assigned to instruction <var>insn</var> as a
function of the context in which it is used.  <var>length</var> is an lvalue
that contains the initially computed length of the insn and should be
updated with the correct length of the insn.

<p>This macro will normally not be required.  A case in which it is
required is the ROMP.  On this machine, the size of an <code>addr_vec</code>
insn must be increased by two to compensate for the fact that alignment
may be required. 
</dl>

<p>The routine that returns <code>get_attr_length</code> (the value of the
<code>length</code> attribute) can be used by the output routine to
determine the form of the branch instruction to be written, as the
example below illustrates.

<p>As an example of the specification of variable-length branches, consider
the IBM 360.  If we adopt the convention that a register will be set to
the starting address of a function, we can jump to labels within 4k of
the start using a four-byte instruction.  Otherwise, we need a six-byte
sequence to load the address from memory and then branch to it.

<p>On such a machine, a pattern for a branch instruction might be specified
as follows:

<pre>(define_insn "jump"
  [(set (pc)
        (label_ref (match_operand 0 "" "")))]
  ""
  "*
{
   return (get_attr_length (insn) == 4
           ? \"b %l0\" : \"l r15,=a(%l0); br r15\");
}"
  [(set (attr "length") (if_then_else (lt (match_dup 0) (const_int 4096))
                                      (const_int 4)
                                      (const_int 6)))])
</pre>

<br>

<h3>Constant Attributes</h3>

<p>A special form of <code>define_attr</code>, where the expression for the
default value is a <code>const</code> expression, indicates an attribute that
is constant for a given run of the compiler.  Constant attributes may be
used to specify which variety of processor is used.  For example,

<pre>(define_attr "cpu" "m88100,m88110,m88000"
 (const
  (cond [(symbol_ref "TARGET_88100") (const_string "m88100")
         (symbol_ref "TARGET_88110") (const_string "m88110")]
        (const_string "m88000"))))

(define_attr "memory" "fast,slow"
 (const
  (if_then_else (symbol_ref "TARGET_FAST_MEM")
                (const_string "fast")
                (const_string "slow"))))
</pre>

<p>The routine generated for constant attributes has no parameters as it
does not depend on any particular insn.  RTL expressions used to define
the value of a constant attribute may use the <code>symbol_ref</code> form,
but may not use either the <code>match_operand</code> form or <code>eq_attr</code>
forms involving insn attributes.

<h3>Delay Slot Scheduling</h3>

<p>The insn attribute mechanism can be used to specify the requirements for
delay slots, if any, on a target machine.  An instruction is said to
require a <dfn>delay slot</dfn> if some instructions that are physically
after the instruction are executed as if they were located before it. 
Classic examples are branch and call instructions, which often execute
the following instruction before the branch or call is performed.

<p>On some machines, conditional branch instructions can optionally
<dfn>annul</dfn> instructions in the delay slot.  This means that the
instruction will not be executed for certain branch outcomes.  Both
instructions that annul if the branch is true and instructions that
annul if the branch is false are supported.

<p>Delay slot scheduling differs from instruction scheduling in that
determining whether an instruction needs a delay slot is dependent only
on the type of instruction being generated, not on data flow between the
instructions.  See the next section for a discussion of data-dependent
instruction scheduling.

<p>The requirement of an insn needing one or more delay slots is indicated
via the <code>define_delay</code> expression.  It has the following form:

<pre>(define_delay <var>test</var>
              [<var>delay-1</var> <var>annul-true-1</var> <var>annul-false-1</var>
               <var>delay-2</var> <var>annul-true-2</var> <var>annul-false-2</var>
               <small>...</small>])
</pre>

<p><var>test</var> is an attribute test that indicates whether this
<code>define_delay</code> applies to a particular insn.  If so, the number of
required delay slots is determined by the length of the vector specified
as the second argument.  An insn placed in delay slot <var>n</var> must
satisfy attribute test <var>delay-n</var>.  <var>annul-true-n</var> is an
attribute test that specifies which insns may be annulled if the branch
is true.  Similarly, <var>annul-false-n</var> specifies which insns in the
delay slot may be annulled if the branch is false.  If annulling is not
supported for that delay slot, <code>(nil)</code> should be coded.

<p>For example, in the common case where branch and call insns require
a single delay slot, which may contain any insn other than a branch or
call, the following would be placed in the <code>md</code> file:

<pre>(define_delay (eq_attr "type" "branch,call")
              [(eq_attr "type" "!branch,call") (nil) (nil)])
</pre>

<p>Multiple <code>define_delay</code> expressions may be specified.  In this
case, each such expression specifies different delay slot requirements
and there must be no insn for which tests in two <code>define_delay</code>
expressions are both true.

<p>For example, if we have a machine that requires one delay slot for branches
but two for calls,  no delay slot can contain a branch or call insn,
and any valid insn in the delay slot for the branch can be annulled if the
branch is true, we might represent this as follows:

<pre>(define_delay (eq_attr "type" "branch")
   [(eq_attr "type" "!branch,call")
    (eq_attr "type" "!branch,call")
    (nil)])

(define_delay (eq_attr "type" "call")
              [(eq_attr "type" "!branch,call") (nil) (nil)
               (eq_attr "type" "!branch,call") (nil) (nil)])
</pre>

<br>

<h3>Specifying Function Units</h3>

<p>On most RISC machines, there are instructions whose results are not
available for a specific number of cycles.  Common cases are instructions
that load data from memory.  On many machines, a pipeline stall will result
if the data is referenced too soon after the load instruction.

<p>In addition, many newer microprocessors have multiple function units, usually
one for integer and one for floating point, and often will incur pipeline
stalls when a result that is needed is not yet ready.

<p>The descriptions in this section allow the specification of how much
time must elapse between the execution of an instruction and the time
when its result is used.  It also allows specification of when the
execution of an instruction will delay execution of similar instructions
due to function unit conflicts.

<p>For the purposes of the specifications in this section, a machine is
divided into <dfn>function units</dfn>, each of which execute a specific
class of instructions in first-in-first-out order.  Function units that
accept one instruction each cycle and allow a result to be used in the
succeeding instruction (usually via forwarding) need not be specified. 
Classic RISC microprocessors will normally have a single function unit,
which we can call <code>memory</code>.  The newer "superscalar" processors
will often have function units for floating point operations, usually at
least a floating point adder and multiplier.

<p>Each usage of a function units by a class of insns is specified with a
<code>define_function_unit</code> expression, which looks like this:

<pre>(define_function_unit <var>name</var> <var>multiplicity</var> <var>simultaneity</var>
                      <var>test</var> <var>ready-delay</var> <var>issue-delay</var>
                     [<var>conflict-list</var>])
</pre>

<p><var>name</var> is a string giving the name of the function unit.

<p><var>multiplicity</var> is an integer specifying the number of identical
units in the processor.  If more than one unit is specified, they will
be scheduled independently.  Only truly independent units should be
counted; a pipelined unit should be specified as a single unit.  (The
only common example of a machine that has multiple function units for a
single instruction class that are truly independent and not pipelined
are the two multiply and two increment units of the CDC 6600.)

<p><var>simultaneity</var> specifies the maximum number of insns that can be
executing in each instance of the function unit simultaneously or zero
if the unit is pipelined and has no limit.

<p>All <code>define_function_unit</code> definitions referring to function unit
<var>name</var> must have the same name and values for <var>multiplicity</var> and
<var>simultaneity</var>.

<p><var>test</var> is an attribute test that selects the insns we are describing
in this definition.  Note that an insn may use more than one function
unit and a function unit may be specified in more than one
<code>define_function_unit</code>.

<p><var>ready-delay</var> is an integer that specifies the number of cycles
after which the result of the instruction can be used without
introducing any stalls.

<p><var>issue-delay</var> is an integer that specifies the number of cycles
after the instruction matching the <var>test</var> expression begins using
this unit until a subsequent instruction can begin.  A cost of <var>N</var>
indicates an <var>N-1</var> cycle delay.  A subsequent instruction may also
be delayed if an earlier instruction has a longer <var>ready-delay</var>
value.  This blocking effect is computed using the <var>simultaneity</var>,
<var>ready-delay</var>, <var>issue-delay</var>, and <var>conflict-list</var> terms. 
For a normal non-pipelined function unit, <var>simultaneity</var> is one, the
unit is taken to block for the <var>ready-delay</var> cycles of the executing
insn, and smaller values of <var>issue-delay</var> are ignored.

<p><var>conflict-list</var> is an optional list giving detailed conflict costs
for this unit.  If specified, it is a list of condition test expressions
to be applied to insns chosen to execute in <var>name</var> following the
particular insn matching <var>test</var> that is already executing in
<var>name</var>.  For each insn in the list, <var>issue-delay</var> specifies the
conflict cost; for insns not in the list, the cost is zero.  If not
specified, <var>conflict-list</var> defaults to all instructions that use the
function unit.

<p>Typical uses of this vector are where a floating point function unit can
pipeline either single- or double-precision operations, but not both, or
where a memory unit can pipeline loads, but not stores, etc.

<p>As an example, consider a classic RISC machine where the result of a
load instruction is not available for two cycles (a single "delay"
instruction is required) and where only one load instruction can be executed
simultaneously.  This would be specified as:

<pre>(define_function_unit "memory" 1 1 (eq_attr "type" "load") 2 0)
</pre>

<p>For the case of a floating point function unit that can pipeline either
single or double precision, but not both, the following could be specified:

<pre>(define_function_unit
   "fp" 1 0 (eq_attr "type" "sp_fp") 4 4 [(eq_attr "type" "dp_fp")])
(define_function_unit
   "fp" 1 0 (eq_attr "type" "dp_fp") 4 4 [(eq_attr "type" "sp_fp")])
</pre>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The scheduler attempts to avoid function unit conflicts
and uses all the specifications in the <code>define_function_unit</code>
expression.  It has recently come to our attention that these
specifications may not allow modeling of some of the newer
"superscalar" processors that have insns using multiple pipelined
units.  These insns will cause a potential conflict for the second unit
used during their execution and there is no way of representing that
conflict.  We welcome any examples of how function unit conflicts work
in such processors and suggestions for their representation.

<h2>Controlling the Compilation Driver, <code>gcc</code></h2>

<p>You can control the compilation driver.

<dl>
<dt><code>SWITCH_TAKES_ARG (<var>char</var>)</code>
<dd>A C expression which determines whether the option <code>-<var>char</var></code>
takes arguments.  The value should be the number of arguments that
option takes-zero, for many options.

<p>By default, this macro is defined as
<code>DEFAULT_SWITCH_TAKES_ARG</code>, which handles the standard options
properly.  You need not define <code>SWITCH_TAKES_ARG</code> unless you
wish to add additional options which take arguments.  Any redefinition
should call <code>DEFAULT_SWITCH_TAKES_ARG</code> and then check for
additional options.

<br><dt><code>WORD_SWITCH_TAKES_ARG (<var>name</var>)</code>
<dd>A C expression which determines whether the option <code>-<var>name</var></code>
takes arguments.  The value should be the number of arguments that
option takes-zero, for many options.  This macro rather than
<code>SWITCH_TAKES_ARG</code> is used for multi-character option names.

<p>By default, this macro is defined as
<code>DEFAULT_WORD_SWITCH_TAKES_ARG</code>, which handles the standard options
properly.  You need not define <code>WORD_SWITCH_TAKES_ARG</code> unless you
wish to add additional options which take arguments.  Any redefinition
should call <code>DEFAULT_WORD_SWITCH_TAKES_ARG</code> and then check for
additional options.

<br><dt><code>SWITCH_CURTAILS_COMPILATION (<var>char</var>)</code>
<dd>A C expression which determines whether the option <code>-<var>char</var></code>
stops compilation before the generation of an executable.  The value is
boolean, non-zero if the option does stop an executable from being
generated, zero otherwise.

<p>By default, this macro is defined as
<code>DEFAULT_SWITCH_CURTAILS_COMPILATION</code>, which handles the standard
options properly.  You need not define
<code>SWITCH_CURTAILS_COMPILATION</code> unless you wish to add additional
options which affect the generation of an executable.  Any redefinition
should call <code>DEFAULT_SWITCH_CURTAILS_COMPILATION</code> and then check
for additional options.

<br><dt><code>SWITCHES_NEED_SPACES</code>
<dd>A string-valued C expression which enumerates the options for which
the linker needs a space between the option and its argument.

<p>If this macro is not defined, the default value is <code>""</code>.

<br><dt><code>CPP_SPEC</code>
<dd>A C string constant that tells the GNU CC driver program options to
pass to CPP.  It can also specify how to translate options you
give to GNU CC into options for GNU CC to pass to the CPP.

<p>Do not define this macro if it does not need to do anything.

<br><dt><code>NO_BUILTIN_SIZE_TYPE</code>
<dd>If this macro is defined, the preprocessor will not define the builtin macro
<code>__SIZE_TYPE__</code>.  The macro <code>__SIZE_TYPE__</code> must then be defined
by <code>CPP_SPEC</code> instead.

<p>This should be defined if <code>SIZE_TYPE</code> depends on target dependent flags
which are not accessible to the preprocessor.  Otherwise, it should not
be defined.

<br><dt><code>NO_BUILTIN_PTRDIFF_TYPE</code>
<dd>If this macro is defined, the preprocessor will not define the builtin macro
<code>__PTRDIFF_TYPE__</code>.  The macro <code>__PTRDIFF_TYPE__</code> must then be
defined by <code>CPP_SPEC</code> instead.

<p>This should be defined if <code>PTRDIFF_TYPE</code> depends on target dependent flags
which are not accessible to the preprocessor.  Otherwise, it should not
be defined.

<br><dt><code>SIGNED_CHAR_SPEC</code>
<dd>A C string constant that tells the GNU CC driver program options to
pass to CPP.  By default, this macro is defined to pass the option
<code>-D__CHAR_UNSIGNED__</code> to CPP if <code>char</code> will be treated as
<code>unsigned char</code> by <code>cc1</code>.

<p>Do not define this macro unless you need to override the default
definition.

<br><dt><code>CC1_SPEC</code>
<dd>A C string constant that tells the GNU CC driver program options to
pass to <code>cc1</code>.  It can also specify how to translate options you
give to GNU CC into options for GNU CC to pass to the <code>cc1</code>.

<p>Do not define this macro if it does not need to do anything.

<br><dt><code>CC1PLUS_SPEC</code>
<dd>A C string constant that tells the GNU CC driver program options to
pass to <code>cc1plus</code>.  It can also specify how to translate options you
give to GNU CC into options for GNU CC to pass to the <code>cc1plus</code>.

<p>Do not define this macro if it does not need to do anything.

<br><dt><code>ASM_SPEC</code>
<dd>A C string constant that tells the GNU CC driver program options to
pass to the assembler.  It can also specify how to translate options
you give to GNU CC into options for GNU CC to pass to the assembler. 
See the file <code>sun3.h</code> for an example of this.

<p>Do not define this macro if it does not need to do anything.

<br><dt><code>ASM_FINAL_SPEC</code>
<dd>A C string constant that tells the GNU CC driver program how to
run any programs which cleanup after the normal assembler. 
Normally, this is not needed.  See the file <code>mips.h</code> for
an example of this.

<p>Do not define this macro if it does not need to do anything.

<br><dt><code>LINK_SPEC</code>
<dd>A C string constant that tells the GNU CC driver program options to
pass to the linker.  It can also specify how to translate options you
give to GNU CC into options for GNU CC to pass to the linker.

<p>Do not define this macro if it does not need to do anything.

<br><dt><code>LIB_SPEC</code>
<dd>Another C string constant used much like <code>LINK_SPEC</code>.  The difference
between the two is that <code>LIB_SPEC</code> is used at the end of the
command given to the linker.

<p>If this macro is not defined, a default is provided that
loads the standard C library from the usual place.  See <code>gcc.c</code>.

<br><dt><code>LIBGCC_SPEC</code>
<dd>Another C string constant that tells the GNU CC driver program
how and when to place a reference to <code>libgcc.a</code> into the
linker command line.  This constant is placed both before and after
the value of <code>LIB_SPEC</code>.

<p>If this macro is not defined, the GNU CC driver provides a default that
passes the string <code>-lgcc</code> to the linker unless the <code>-shared</code>
option is specified.

<br><dt><code>STARTFILE_SPEC</code>
<dd>Another C string constant used much like <code>LINK_SPEC</code>.  The
difference between the two is that <code>STARTFILE_SPEC</code> is used at
the very beginning of the command given to the linker.

<p>If this macro is not defined, a default is provided that loads the
standard C startup file from the usual place.  See <code>gcc.c</code>.

<br><dt><code>ENDFILE_SPEC</code>
<dd>Another C string constant used much like <code>LINK_SPEC</code>.  The
difference between the two is that <code>ENDFILE_SPEC</code> is used at
the very end of the command given to the linker.

<p>Do not define this macro if it does not need to do anything.

<br><dt><code>EXTRA_SPECS</code>
<dd>Define this macro to provide additional specifications to put in the
<code>specs</code> file that can be used in various specifications like
<code>CC1_SPEC</code>.

<p>The definition should be an initializer for an array of structures,
containing a string constant, that defines the specification name, and a
string constant that provides the specification.

<p>Do not define this macro if it does not need to do anything.

<p><code>EXTRA_SPECS</code> is useful when an architecture contains several
related targets, which have various <code>..._SPECS</code> which are similar
to each other, and the maintainer would like one central place to keep
these definitions.

<p>For example, the PowerPC System V.4 targets use <code>EXTRA_SPECS</code> to
define either <code>_CALL_SYSV</code> when the System V calling sequence is
used or <code>_CALL_AIX</code> when the older AIX-based calling sequence is
used.

<p>The <code>config/rs6000/rs6000.h</code> target file defines:

<pre>#define EXTRA_SPECS \
  { "cpp_sysv_default", CPP_SYSV_DEFAULT },

#define CPP_SYS_DEFAULT ""
</pre>

<p>The <code>config/rs6000/sysv.h</code> target file defines:
<pre>#undef CPP_SPEC
#define CPP_SPEC \
"%{posix: -D_POSIX_SOURCE } \
%{mcall-sysv: -D_CALL_SYSV } %{mcall-aix: -D_CALL_AIX } \
%{!mcall-sysv: %{!mcall-aix: %(cpp_sysv_default) }} \
%{msoft-float: -D_SOFT_FLOAT} %{mcpu=403: -D_SOFT_FLOAT}"

#undef CPP_SYSV_DEFAULT
#define CPP_SYSV_DEFAULT "-D_CALL_SYSV"
</pre>

<p>while the <code>config/rs6000/eabiaix.h</code> target file defines
<code>CPP_SYSV_DEFAULT</code> as:

<pre>#undef CPP_SYSV_DEFAULT
#define CPP_SYSV_DEFAULT "-D_CALL_AIX"
</pre>

<br><dt><code>LINK_LIBGCC_SPECIAL</code>
<dd>Define this macro if the driver program should find the library
<code>libgcc.a</code> itself and should not pass <code>-L</code> options to the
linker.  If you do not define this macro, the driver program will pass
the argument <code>-lgcc</code> to tell the linker to do the search and will
pass <code>-L</code> options to it.

<br><dt><code>LINK_LIBGCC_SPECIAL_1</code>
<dd>Define this macro if the driver program should find the library
<code>libgcc.a</code>.  If you do not define this macro, the driver program will pass
the argument <code>-lgcc</code> to tell the linker to do the search. 
This macro is similar to <code>LINK_LIBGCC_SPECIAL</code>, except that it does
not affect <code>-L</code> options.

<br><dt><code>LINK_COMMAND_SPEC</code>
<dd>A C string constant giving the complete command line need to execute the
linker.  When you do this, you will need to update your port each time a
change is made to the link command line within <code>gcc.c</code>.  Therefore,
define this macro only if you need to completely redefine the command
line for invoking the linker and there is no other way to accomplish
the effect you need.

<br><dt><code>MULTILIB_DEFAULTS</code>
<dd>Define this macro as a C expression for the initializer of an array of
string to tell the driver program which options are defaults for this
target and thus do not need to be handled specially when using
<code>MULTILIB_OPTIONS</code>.

<p>Do not define this macro if <code>MULTILIB_OPTIONS</code> is not defined in
the target makefile fragment or if none of the options listed in
<code>MULTILIB_OPTIONS</code> are set by default. 
See <a href="#Target%20Fragment">Target Fragment</a>.

<br><dt><code>RELATIVE_PREFIX_NOT_LINKDIR</code>
<dd>Define this macro to tell <code>gcc</code> that it should only translate
a <code>-B</code> prefix into a <code>-L</code> linker option if the prefix
indicates an absolute file name.

<br><dt><code>STANDARD_EXEC_PREFIX</code>
<dd>Define this macro as a C string constant if you wish to override the
standard choice of <code>/usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/</code> as the default prefix to
try when searching for the executable files of the compiler.

<br><dt><code>MD_EXEC_PREFIX</code>
<dd>If defined, this macro is an additional prefix to try after
<code>STANDARD_EXEC_PREFIX</code>.  <code>MD_EXEC_PREFIX</code> is not searched
when the <code>-b</code> option is used, or the compiler is built as a cross
compiler.  If you define <code>MD_EXEC_PREFIX</code>, then be sure to add it
to the list of directories used to find the assembler in <code>configure.in</code>.

<br><dt><code>STANDARD_STARTFILE_PREFIX</code>
<dd>Define this macro as a C string constant if you wish to override the
standard choice of <code>/usr/local/lib/</code> as the default prefix to
try when searching for startup files such as <code>crt0.o</code>.

<br><dt><code>MD_STARTFILE_PREFIX</code>
<dd>If defined, this macro supplies an additional prefix to try after the
standard prefixes.  <code>MD_EXEC_PREFIX</code> is not searched when the
<code>-b</code> option is used, or when the compiler is built as a cross
compiler.

<br><dt><code>MD_STARTFILE_PREFIX_1</code>
<dd>If defined, this macro supplies yet another prefix to try after the
standard prefixes.  It is not searched when the <code>-b</code> option is
used, or when the compiler is built as a cross compiler.

<br><dt><code>INIT_ENVIRONMENT</code>
<dd>Define this macro as a C string constant if you wish to set environment
variables for programs called by the driver, such as the assembler and
loader.  The driver passes the value of this macro to <code>putenv</code> to
initialize the necessary environment variables.

<br><dt><code>LOCAL_INCLUDE_DIR</code>
<dd>Define this macro as a C string constant if you wish to override the
standard choice of <code>/usr/local/include</code> as the default prefix to
try when searching for local header files.  <code>LOCAL_INCLUDE_DIR</code>
comes before <code>SYSTEM_INCLUDE_DIR</code> in the search order.

<p>Cross compilers do not use this macro and do not search either
<code>/usr/local/include</code> or its replacement.

<br><dt><code>SYSTEM_INCLUDE_DIR</code>
<dd>Define this macro as a C string constant if you wish to specify a
system-specific directory to search for header files before the standard
directory.  <code>SYSTEM_INCLUDE_DIR</code> comes before
<code>STANDARD_INCLUDE_DIR</code> in the search order.

<p>Cross compilers do not use this macro and do not search the directory
specified.

<br><dt><code>STANDARD_INCLUDE_DIR</code>
<dd>Define this macro as a C string constant if you wish to override the
standard choice of <code>/usr/include</code> as the default prefix to
try when searching for header files.

<p>Cross compilers do not use this macro and do not search either
<code>/usr/include</code> or its replacement.

<br><dt><code>STANDARD_INCLUDE_COMPONENT</code>
<dd>The "component" corresponding to <code>STANDARD_INCLUDE_DIR</code>. 
See <code>INCLUDE_DEFAULTS</code>, below, for the description of components. 
If you do not define this macro, no component is used.

<br><dt><code>INCLUDE_DEFAULTS</code>
<dd>Define this macro if you wish to override the entire default search path
for include files.  For a native compiler, the default search path
usually consists of <code>GCC_INCLUDE_DIR</code>, <code>LOCAL_INCLUDE_DIR</code>,
<code>SYSTEM_INCLUDE_DIR</code>, <code>GPLUSPLUS_INCLUDE_DIR</code>, and
<code>STANDARD_INCLUDE_DIR</code>.  In addition, <code>GPLUSPLUS_INCLUDE_DIR</code>
and <code>GCC_INCLUDE_DIR</code> are defined automatically by <code>Makefile</code>,
and specify private search areas for GCC.  The directory
<code>GPLUSPLUS_INCLUDE_DIR</code> is used only for C++ programs.

<p>The definition should be an initializer for an array of structures. 
Each array element should have four elements: the directory name (a
string constant), the component name, and flag for C++-only directories,
and a flag showing that the includes in the directory don't need to be
wrapped in <code>extern <code>C</code></code> when compiling C++.  Mark the end of
the array with a null element.

<p>The component name denotes what GNU package the include file is part of,
if any, in all upper-case letters.  For example, it might be <code>GCC</code>
or <code>BINUTILS</code>.  If the package is part of the a vendor-supplied
operating system, code the component name as <code>0</code>.

<p>For example, here is the definition used for VAX/VMS:

<pre>#define INCLUDE_DEFAULTS \
{                                       \
  { "GNU_GXX_INCLUDE:", "G++", 1, 1},   \
  { "GNU_CC_INCLUDE:", "GCC", 0, 0},    \
  { "SYS$SYSROOT:[SYSLIB.]", 0, 0, 0},  \
  { ".", 0, 0, 0},                      \
  { 0, 0, 0, 0}                         \
}
</pre>
</dl>

<p>Here is the order of prefixes tried for exec files:

<ol type=1 start=1>
</p><li>Any prefixes specified by the user with <code>-B</code>.

<li>The environment variable <code>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</code>, if any.

<li>The directories specified by the environment variable <code>COMPILER_PATH</code>.

<li>The macro <code>STANDARD_EXEC_PREFIX</code>.

<li><code>/usr/lib/gcc/</code>.

<li>The macro <code>MD_EXEC_PREFIX</code>, if any.
</ol>

<p>Here is the order of prefixes tried for startfiles:

<ol type=1 start=1>
</p><li>Any prefixes specified by the user with <code>-B</code>.

<li>The environment variable <code>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</code>, if any.

<li>The directories specified by the environment variable <code>LIBRARY_PATH</code>
(native only, cross compilers do not use this).

<li>The macro <code>STANDARD_EXEC_PREFIX</code>.

<li><code>/usr/lib/gcc/</code>.

<li>The macro <code>MD_EXEC_PREFIX</code>, if any.

<li>The macro <code>MD_STARTFILE_PREFIX</code>, if any.

<li>The macro <code>STANDARD_STARTFILE_PREFIX</code>.

<li><code>/lib/</code>.

<h2>Run-time Target Specification</h2>

<p>Here are run-time target specifications.

<dl>
<dt><code>CPP_PREDEFINES</code>
<dd>Define this to be a string constant containing <code>-D</code> options to
define the predefined macros that identify this machine and system. 
These macros will be predefined unless the <code>-ansi</code> option is
specified.

<p>In addition, a parallel set of macros are predefined, whose names are
made by appending <code>__</code> at the beginning and at the end.  These
<code>__</code> macros are permitted by the ANSI standard, so they are
predefined regardless of whether <code>-ansi</code> is specified.

<p>For example, on the Sun, one can use the following value:

<pre>"-Dmc68000 -Dsun -Dunix"
</pre>

<p>The result is to define the macros <code>__mc68000__</code>, <code>__sun__</code>
and <code>__unix__</code> unconditionally, and the macros <code>mc68000</code>,
<code>sun</code> and <code>unix</code> provided <code>-ansi</code> is not specified.

<br><dt><code>extern int target_flags;</code>
<dd>This declaration should be present.

<br><dt><code>TARGET_<small>...</small></code>
<dd>This series of macros is to allow compiler command arguments to
enable or disable the use of optional features of the target machine. 
For example, one machine description serves both the 68000 and
the 68020; a command argument tells the compiler whether it should
use 68020-only instructions or not.  This command argument works
by means of a macro <code>TARGET_68020</code> that tests a bit in
<code>target_flags</code>.

<p>Define a macro <code>TARGET_<var>featurename</var></code> for each such option. 
Its definition should test a bit in <code>target_flags</code>; for example:

<pre>#define TARGET_68020 (target_flags &amp; 1)
</pre>

<p>One place where these macros are used is in the condition-expressions
of instruction patterns.  Note how <code>TARGET_68020</code> appears
frequently in the 68000 machine description file, <code>m68k.md</code>. 
Another place they are used is in the definitions of the other
macros in the <code><var>machine</var>.h</code> file.

<br><dt><code>TARGET_SWITCHES</code>
<dd>This macro defines names of command options to set and clear
bits in <code>target_flags</code>.  Its definition is an initializer
with a subgrouping for each command option.

<p>Each subgrouping contains a string constant, that defines the option
name, a number, which contains the bits to set in
<code>target_flags</code>, and a second string which is the description
displayed by -help.  If the number is negative then the bits specified
by the number are cleared instead of being set.  If the description
string is present but empty, then no help information will be displayed
for that option, but it will not count as an undocumented option.  The
actual option name is made by appending <code>-m</code> to the specified name.

<p>One of the subgroupings should have a null string.  The number in
this grouping is the default value for <code>target_flags</code>.  Any
target options act starting with that value.

<p>Here is an example which defines <code>-m68000</code> and <code>-m68020</code>
with opposite meanings, and picks the latter as the default:

<pre>#define TARGET_SWITCHES \
  { { "68020", 1, "" },      \
    { "68000", -1, "Compile for the 68000" }, \
    { "", 1, "" }}
</pre>

<br><dt><code>TARGET_OPTIONS</code>
<dd>This macro is similar to <code>TARGET_SWITCHES</code> but defines names of command
options that have values.  Its definition is an initializer with a
subgrouping for each command option.

<p>Each subgrouping contains a string constant, that defines the fixed part
of the option name, the address of a variable, and a description string. 
The variable, type <code>char *</code>, is set to the variable part of the
given option if the fixed part matches.  The actual option name is made
by appending <code>-m</code> to the specified name.

<p>Here is an example which defines <code>-mshort-data-<var>number</var></code>.  If the
given option is <code>-mshort-data-512</code>, the variable <code>m88k_short_data</code>
will be set to the string <code>"512"</code>.

<pre>extern char *m88k_short_data;
#define TARGET_OPTIONS \
 { { "short-data-", &amp;m88k_short_data, "Specify the size of the short data section" } }
</pre>

<br><dt><code>TARGET_VERSION</code>
<dd>This macro is a C statement to print on <code>stderr</code> a string
describing the particular machine description choice.  Every machine
description should define <code>TARGET_VERSION</code>.  For example:

<pre>#ifdef MOTOROLA
#define TARGET_VERSION \
  fprintf (stderr, " (68k, Motorola syntax)");
#else
#define TARGET_VERSION \
  fprintf (stderr, " (68k, MIT syntax)");
#endif
</pre>

<br><dt><code>OVERRIDE_OPTIONS</code>
<dd>Sometimes certain combinations of command options do not make sense on
a particular target machine.  You can define a macro
<code>OVERRIDE_OPTIONS</code> to take account of this.  This macro, if
defined, is executed once just after all the command options have been
parsed.

<p>Don't use this macro to turn on various extra optimizations for
<code>-O</code>.  That is what <code>OPTIMIZATION_OPTIONS</code> is for.

<br><dt><code>OPTIMIZATION_OPTIONS (<var>level</var>, <var>size</var>)</code>
<dd>Some machines may desire to change what optimizations are performed for
various optimization levels.   This macro, if defined, is executed once
just after the optimization level is determined and before the remainder
of the command options have been parsed.  Values set in this macro are
used as the default values for the other command line options.

<p><var>level</var> is the optimization level specified; 2 if <code>-O2</code> is
specified, 1 if <code>-O</code> is specified, and 0 if neither is specified.

<p><var>size</var> is non-zero if <code>-Os</code> is specified and zero otherwise.

<p>You should not use this macro to change options that are not
machine-specific.  These should uniformly selected by the same
optimization level on all supported machines.  Use this macro to enable
machine-specific optimizations.

<p><strong>Do not examine <code>write_symbols</code> in
this macro!</strong> The debugging options are not supposed to alter the
generated code.

<br><dt><code>CAN_DEBUG_WITHOUT_FP</code>
<dd>Define this macro if debugging can be performed even without a frame
pointer.  If this macro is defined, GNU CC will turn on the
<code>-fomit-frame-pointer</code> option whenever <code>-O</code> is specified.

<h2>Storage Layout</h2>

<p>Note that the definitions of the macros in this table which are sizes or
alignments measured in bits do not need to be constant.  They can be C
expressions that refer to static variables, such as the <code>target_flags</code>. 
See <a href="#Run-time%20Target">Run-time Target</a>.

<dl>
<dt><code>BITS_BIG_ENDIAN</code>
<dd>Define this macro to have the value 1 if the most significant bit in a
byte has the lowest number; otherwise define it to have the value zero. 
This means that bit-field instructions count from the most significant
bit.  If the machine has no bit-field instructions, then this must still
be defined, but it doesn't matter which value it is defined to.  This
macro need not be a constant.

<p>This macro does not affect the way structure fields are packed into
bytes or words; that is controlled by <code>BYTES_BIG_ENDIAN</code>.

<br><dt><code>BYTES_BIG_ENDIAN</code>
<dd>Define this macro to have the value 1 if the most significant byte in a
word has the lowest number.  This macro need not be a constant.

<br><dt><code>WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN</code>
<dd>Define this macro to have the value 1 if, in a multiword object, the
most significant word has the lowest number.  This applies to both
memory locations and registers; GNU CC fundamentally assumes that the
order of words in memory is the same as the order in registers.  This
macro need not be a constant.

<br><dt><code>LIBGCC2_WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN</code>
<dd>Define this macro if WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN is not constant.  This must be a
constant value with the same meaning as WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN, which will be
used only when compiling libgcc2.c.  Typically the value will be set
based on preprocessor defines.

<br><dt><code>FLOAT_WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN</code>
<dd>Define this macro to have the value 1 if <code>DFmode</code>, <code>XFmode</code> or
<code>TFmode</code> floating point numbers are stored in memory with the word
containing the sign bit at the lowest address; otherwise define it to
have the value 0.  This macro need not be a constant.

<p>You need not define this macro if the ordering is the same as for
multi-word integers.

<br><dt><code>BITS_PER_UNIT</code>
<dd>Define this macro to be the number of bits in an addressable storage
unit (byte); normally 8.

<br><dt><code>BITS_PER_WORD</code>
<dd>Number of bits in a word; normally 32.

<br><dt><code>MAX_BITS_PER_WORD</code>
<dd>Maximum number of bits in a word.  If this is undefined, the default is
<code>BITS_PER_WORD</code>.  Otherwise, it is the constant value that is the
largest value that <code>BITS_PER_WORD</code> can have at run-time.

<br><dt><code>UNITS_PER_WORD</code>
<dd>Number of storage units in a word; normally 4.

<br><dt><code>MIN_UNITS_PER_WORD</code>
<dd>Minimum number of units in a word.  If this is undefined, the default is
<code>UNITS_PER_WORD</code>.  Otherwise, it is the constant value that is the
smallest value that <code>UNITS_PER_WORD</code> can have at run-time.

<br><dt><code>POINTER_SIZE</code>
<dd>Width of a pointer, in bits.  You must specify a value no wider than the
width of <code>Pmode</code>.  If it is not equal to the width of <code>Pmode</code>,
you must define <code>POINTERS_EXTEND_UNSIGNED</code>.

<br><dt><code>POINTERS_EXTEND_UNSIGNED</code>
<dd>A C expression whose value is nonzero if pointers that need to be
extended from being <code>POINTER_SIZE</code> bits wide to <code>Pmode</code> are to
be zero-extended and zero if they are to be sign-extended.

<p>You need not define this macro if the <code>POINTER_SIZE</code> is equal
to the width of <code>Pmode</code>.

<br><dt><code>PROMOTE_MODE (<var>m</var>, <var>unsignedp</var>, <var>type</var>)</code>
<dd>A macro to update <var>m</var> and <var>unsignedp</var> when an object whose type
is <var>type</var> and which has the specified mode and signedness is to be
stored in a register.  This macro is only called when <var>type</var> is a
scalar type.

<p>On most RISC machines, which only have operations that operate on a full
register, define this macro to set <var>m</var> to <code>word_mode</code> if
<var>m</var> is an integer mode narrower than <code>BITS_PER_WORD</code>.  In most
cases, only integer modes should be widened because wider-precision
floating-point operations are usually more expensive than their narrower
counterparts.

<p>For most machines, the macro definition does not change <var>unsignedp</var>. 
However, some machines, have instructions that preferentially handle
either signed or unsigned quantities of certain modes.  For example, on
the DEC Alpha, 32-bit loads from memory and 32-bit add instructions
sign-extend the result to 64 bits.  On such machines, set
<var>unsignedp</var> according to which kind of extension is more efficient.

<p>Do not define this macro if it would never modify <var>m</var>.

<br><dt><code>PROMOTE_FUNCTION_ARGS</code>
<dd>Define this macro if the promotion described by <code>PROMOTE_MODE</code>
should also be done for outgoing function arguments.

<br><dt><code>PROMOTE_FUNCTION_RETURN</code>
<dd>Define this macro if the promotion described by <code>PROMOTE_MODE</code>
should also be done for the return value of functions.

<p>If this macro is defined, <code>FUNCTION_VALUE</code> must perform the same
promotions done by <code>PROMOTE_MODE</code>.

<br><dt><code>PROMOTE_FOR_CALL_ONLY</code>
<dd>Define this macro if the promotion described by <code>PROMOTE_MODE</code>
should <em>only</em> be performed for outgoing function arguments or
function return values, as specified by <code>PROMOTE_FUNCTION_ARGS</code>
and <code>PROMOTE_FUNCTION_RETURN</code>, respectively.

<br><dt><code>PARM_BOUNDARY</code>
<dd>Normal alignment required for function parameters on the stack, in
bits.  All stack parameters receive at least this much alignment
regardless of data type.  On most machines, this is the same as the
size of an integer.

<br><dt><code>STACK_BOUNDARY</code>
<dd>Define this macro if there is a guaranteed alignment for the stack
pointer on this machine.  The definition is a C expression
for the desired alignment (measured in bits).  This value is used as a
default if PREFERRED_STACK_BOUNDARY is not defined.

<br><dt><code>PREFERRED_STACK_BOUNDARY</code>
<dd>Define this macro if you wish to preserve a certain alignment for
the stack pointer.  The definition is a C expression
for the desired alignment (measured in bits).  If STACK_BOUNDARY is
also defined, this macro must evaluate to a value equal to or larger
than STACK_BOUNDARY.

<p>If <code>PUSH_ROUNDING</code> is not defined, the stack will always be aligned
to the specified boundary.  If <code>PUSH_ROUNDING</code> is defined and specifies
a less strict alignment than <code>PREFERRED_STACK_BOUNDARY</code>, the stack may
be momentarily unaligned while pushing arguments.

<br><dt><code>FUNCTION_BOUNDARY</code>
<dd>Alignment required for a function entry point, in bits.

<br><dt><code>BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT</code>
<dd>Biggest alignment that any data type can require on this machine, in bits.

<br><dt><code>MINIMUM_ATOMIC_ALIGNMENT</code>
<dd>If defined, the smallest alignment, in bits, that can be given to an
object that can be referenced in one operation, without disturbing any
nearby object.  Normally, this is <code>BITS_PER_UNIT</code>, but may be larger
on machines that don't have byte or half-word store operations.

<br><dt><code>BIGGEST_FIELD_ALIGNMENT</code>
<dd>Biggest alignment that any structure field can require on this machine,
in bits.  If defined, this overrides <code>BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT</code> for
structure fields only.

<br><dt><code>ADJUST_FIELD_ALIGN (<var>field</var>, <var>computed</var>)</code>
<dd>An expression for the alignment of a structure field <var>field</var> if the
alignment computed in the usual way is <var>computed</var>.  GNU CC uses
this value instead of the value in <code>BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT</code> or
<code>BIGGEST_FIELD_ALIGNMENT</code>, if defined, for structure fields only.

<br><dt><code>MAX_OFILE_ALIGNMENT</code>
<dd>Biggest alignment supported by the object file format of this machine. 
Use this macro to limit the alignment which can be specified using the
<code>__attribute__ ((aligned (<var>n</var>)))</code> construct.  If not defined,
the default value is <code>BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT</code>.

<br><dt><code>DATA_ALIGNMENT (<var>type</var>, <var>basic-align</var>)</code>
<dd>If defined, a C expression to compute the alignment for a variables in
the static store.  <var>type</var> is the data type, and <var>basic-align</var> is
the alignment that the object would ordinarily have.  The value of this
macro is used instead of that alignment to align the object.

<p>If this macro is not defined, then <var>basic-align</var> is used.

<p>One use of this macro is to increase alignment of medium-size data to
make it all fit in fewer cache lines.  Another is to cause character
arrays to be word-aligned so that <code>strcpy</code> calls that copy
constants to character arrays can be done inline.

<br><dt><code>CONSTANT_ALIGNMENT (<var>constant</var>, <var>basic-align</var>)</code>
<dd>If defined, a C expression to compute the alignment given to a constant
that is being placed in memory.  <var>constant</var> is the constant and
<var>basic-align</var> is the alignment that the object would ordinarily
have.  The value of this macro is used instead of that alignment to
align the object.

<p>If this macro is not defined, then <var>basic-align</var> is used.

<p>The typical use of this macro is to increase alignment for string
constants to be word aligned so that <code>strcpy</code> calls that copy
constants can be done inline.

<br><dt><code>LOCAL_ALIGNMENT (<var>type</var>, <var>basic-align</var>)</code>
<dd>If defined, a C expression to compute the alignment for a variables in
the local store.  <var>type</var> is the data type, and <var>basic-align</var> is
the alignment that the object would ordinarily have.  The value of this
macro is used instead of that alignment to align the object.

<p>If this macro is not defined, then <var>basic-align</var> is used.

<p>One use of this macro is to increase alignment of medium-size data to
make it all fit in fewer cache lines.

<br><dt><code>EMPTY_FIELD_BOUNDARY</code>
<dd>Alignment in bits to be given to a structure bit field that follows an
empty field such as <code>int : 0;</code>.

<p>Note that <code>PCC_BITFIELD_TYPE_MATTERS</code> also affects the alignment
that results from an empty field.

<br><dt><code>STRUCTURE_SIZE_BOUNDARY</code>
<dd>Number of bits which any structure or union's size must be a multiple of. 
Each structure or union's size is rounded up to a multiple of this.

<p>If you do not define this macro, the default is the same as
<code>BITS_PER_UNIT</code>.

<br><dt><code>STRICT_ALIGNMENT</code>
<dd>Define this macro to be the value 1 if instructions will fail to work
if given data not on the nominal alignment.  If instructions will merely
go slower in that case, define this macro as 0.

<br><dt><code>PCC_BITFIELD_TYPE_MATTERS</code>
<dd>Define this if you wish to imitate the way many other C compilers handle
alignment of bitfields and the structures that contain them.

<p>The behavior is that the type written for a bitfield (<code>int</code>,
<code>short</code>, or other integer type) imposes an alignment for the
entire structure, as if the structure really did contain an ordinary
field of that type.  In addition, the bitfield is placed within the
structure so that it would fit within such a field, not crossing a
boundary for it.

<p>Thus, on most machines, a bitfield whose type is written as <code>int</code>
would not cross a four-byte boundary, and would force four-byte
alignment for the whole structure.  (The alignment used may not be four
bytes; it is controlled by the other alignment parameters.)

<p>If the macro is defined, its definition should be a C expression;
a nonzero value for the expression enables this behavior.

<p>Note that if this macro is not defined, or its value is zero, some
bitfields may cross more than one alignment boundary.  The compiler can
support such references if there are <code>insv</code>, <code>extv</code>, and
<code>extzv</code> insns that can directly reference memory.

<p>The other known way of making bitfields work is to define
<code>STRUCTURE_SIZE_BOUNDARY</code> as large as <code>BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT</code>. 
Then every structure can be accessed with fullwords.

<p>Unless the machine has bitfield instructions or you define
<code>STRUCTURE_SIZE_BOUNDARY</code> that way, you must define
<code>PCC_BITFIELD_TYPE_MATTERS</code> to have a nonzero value.

<p>If your aim is to make GNU CC use the same conventions for laying out
bitfields as are used by another compiler, here is how to investigate
what the other compiler does.  Compile and run this program:

<pre>struct foo1
{
  char x;
  char :0;
  char y;
};

struct foo2
{
  char x;
  int :0;
  char y;
};

main ()
{
  printf ("Size of foo1 is %d\n",
          sizeof (struct foo1));
  printf ("Size of foo2 is %d\n",
          sizeof (struct foo2));
  exit (0);
}
</pre>

<p>If this prints 2 and 5, then the compiler's behavior is what you would
get from <code>PCC_BITFIELD_TYPE_MATTERS</code>.

<br><dt><code>BITFIELD_NBYTES_LIMITED</code>
<dd>Like PCC_BITFIELD_TYPE_MATTERS except that its effect is limited to
aligning a bitfield within the structure.

<br><dt><code>ROUND_TYPE_SIZE (<var>type</var>, <var>computed</var>, <var>specified</var>)</code>
<dd>Define this macro as an expression for the overall size of a type
(given by <var>type</var> as a tree node) when the size computed in the
usual way is <var>computed</var> and the alignment is <var>specified</var>.

<p>The default is to round <var>computed</var> up to a multiple of <var>specified</var>.

<br><dt><code>ROUND_TYPE_ALIGN (<var>type</var>, <var>computed</var>, <var>specified</var>)</code>
<dd>Define this macro as an expression for the alignment of a type (given
by <var>type</var> as a tree node) if the alignment computed in the usual
way is <var>computed</var> and the alignment explicitly specified was
<var>specified</var>.

<p>The default is to use <var>specified</var> if it is larger; otherwise, use
the smaller of <var>computed</var> and <code>BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT</code>

<br><dt><code>MAX_FIXED_MODE_SIZE</code>
<dd>An integer expression for the size in bits of the largest integer
machine mode that should actually be used.  All integer machine modes of
this size or smaller can be used for structures and unions with the
appropriate sizes.  If this macro is undefined, <code>GET_MODE_BITSIZE
(DImode)</code> is assumed.

<br><dt><code>STACK_SAVEAREA_MODE (<var>save_level</var>)</code>
<dd>If defined, an expression of type <code>enum machine_mode</code> that
specifies the mode of the save area operand of a
<code>save_stack_<var>level</var></code> named pattern (see <a href="#Standard%20Names">Standard Names</a>). 
<var>save_level</var> is one of <code>SAVE_BLOCK</code>, <code>SAVE_FUNCTION</code>, or
<code>SAVE_NONLOCAL</code> and selects which of the three named patterns is
having its mode specified.

<p>You need not define this macro if it always returns <code>Pmode</code>.  You
would most commonly define this macro if the
<code>save_stack_<var>level</var></code> patterns need to support both a 32- and a
64-bit mode.

<br><dt><code>STACK_SIZE_MODE</code>
<dd>If defined, an expression of type <code>enum machine_mode</code> that
specifies the mode of the size increment operand of an
<code>allocate_stack</code> named pattern (see <a href="#Standard%20Names">Standard Names</a>).

<p>You need not define this macro if it always returns <code>word_mode</code>. 
You would most commonly define this macro if the <code>allocate_stack</code>
pattern needs to support both a 32- and a 64-bit mode.

<br><dt><code>CHECK_FLOAT_VALUE (<var>mode</var>, <var>value</var>, <var>overflow</var>)</code>
<dd>A C statement to validate the value <var>value</var> (of type
<code>double</code>) for mode <var>mode</var>.  This means that you check whether
<var>value</var> fits within the possible range of values for mode
<var>mode</var> on this target machine.  The mode <var>mode</var> is always
a mode of class <code>MODE_FLOAT</code>.  <var>overflow</var> is nonzero if
the value is already known to be out of range.

<p>If <var>value</var> is not valid or if <var>overflow</var> is nonzero, you should
set <var>overflow</var> to 1 and then assign some valid value to <var>value</var>. 
Allowing an invalid value to go through the compiler can produce
incorrect assembler code which may even cause Unix assemblers to crash.

<p>This macro need not be defined if there is no work for it to do.

<br><dt><code>TARGET_FLOAT_FORMAT</code>
<dd>A code distinguishing the floating point format of the target machine. 
There are three defined values:

<dl>
<dt><code>IEEE_FLOAT_FORMAT</code>
<dd>This code indicates IEEE floating point.  It is the default; there is no
need to define this macro when the format is IEEE.

<br><dt><code>VAX_FLOAT_FORMAT</code>
<dd>This code indicates the peculiar format used on the Vax.

<br><dt><code>UNKNOWN_FLOAT_FORMAT</code>
<dd>This code indicates any other format. 
</dl>

<p>The value of this macro is compared with <code>HOST_FLOAT_FORMAT</code>
(see <a href="#Config">Config</a>) to determine whether the target machine has the same
format as the host machine.  If any other formats are actually in use on
supported machines, new codes should be defined for them.

<p>The ordering of the component words of floating point values stored in
memory is controlled by <code>FLOAT_WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN</code> for the target
machine and <code>HOST_FLOAT_WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN</code> for the host.

<br><dt><code>DEFAULT_VTABLE_THUNKS</code>
<dd>GNU CC supports two ways of implementing C++ vtables:  traditional or with
so-called "thunks".  The flag <code>-fvtable-thunk</code> chooses between them. 
Define this macro to be a C expression for the default value of that flag. 
If <code>DEFAULT_VTABLE_THUNKS</code> is 0, GNU CC uses the traditional
implementation by default.  The "thunk" implementation is more efficient
(especially if you have provided an implementation of
<code>ASM_OUTPUT_MI_THUNK</code>, see <a href="#Function%20Entry">Function Entry</a>), but is not binary
compatible with code compiled using the traditional implementation. 
If you are writing a new ports, define <code>DEFAULT_VTABLE_THUNKS</code> to 1.

<p>If you do not define this macro, the default for <code>-fvtable-thunk</code> is 0.

<h2>Layout of Source Language Data Types</h2>

<p>These macros define the sizes and other characteristics of the standard
basic data types used in programs being compiled.  Unlike the macros in
the previous section, these apply to specific features of C and related
languages, rather than to fundamental aspects of storage layout.

<dl>
<dt><code>INT_TYPE_SIZE</code>
<dd>A C expression for the size in bits of the type <code>int</code> on the
target machine.  If you don't define this, the default is one word.

<br><dt><code>MAX_INT_TYPE_SIZE</code>
<dd>Maximum number for the size in bits of the type <code>int</code> on the target
machine.  If this is undefined, the default is <code>INT_TYPE_SIZE</code>. 
Otherwise, it is the constant value that is the largest value that
<code>INT_TYPE_SIZE</code> can have at run-time.  This is used in <code>cpp</code>.

<br><dt><code>SHORT_TYPE_SIZE</code>
<dd>A C expression for the size in bits of the type <code>short</code> on the
target machine.  If you don't define this, the default is half a word. 
(If this would be less than one storage unit, it is rounded up to one
unit.)

<br><dt><code>LONG_TYPE_SIZE</code>
<dd>A C expression for the size in bits of the type <code>long</code> on the
target machine.  If you don't define this, the default is one word.

<br><dt><code>MAX_LONG_TYPE_SIZE</code>
<dd>Maximum number for the size in bits of the type <code>long</code> on the
target machine.  If this is undefined, the default is
<code>LONG_TYPE_SIZE</code>.  Otherwise, it is the constant value that is the
largest value that <code>LONG_TYPE_SIZE</code> can have at run-time.  This is
used in <code>cpp</code>.

<br><dt><code>LONG_LONG_TYPE_SIZE</code>
<dd>A C expression for the size in bits of the type <code>long long</code> on the
target machine.  If you don't define this, the default is two
words.  If you want to support GNU Ada on your machine, the value of
macro must be at least 64.

<br><dt><code>CHAR_TYPE_SIZE</code>
<dd>A C expression for the size in bits of the type <code>char</code> on the
target machine.  If you don't define this, the default is one quarter
of a word.  (If this would be less than one storage unit, it is rounded up
to one unit.)

<br><dt><code>MAX_CHAR_TYPE_SIZE</code>
<dd>Maximum number for the size in bits of the type <code>char</code> on the
target machine.  If this is undefined, the default is
<code>CHAR_TYPE_SIZE</code>.  Otherwise, it is the constant value that is the
largest value that <code>CHAR_TYPE_SIZE</code> can have at run-time.  This is
used in <code>cpp</code>.

<br><dt><code>FLOAT_TYPE_SIZE</code>
<dd>A C expression for the size in bits of the type <code>float</code> on the
target machine.  If you don't define this, the default is one word.

<br><dt><code>DOUBLE_TYPE_SIZE</code>
<dd>A C expression for the size in bits of the type <code>double</code> on the
target machine.  If you don't define this, the default is two
words.

<br><dt><code>LONG_DOUBLE_TYPE_SIZE</code>
<dd>A C expression for the size in bits of the type <code>long double</code> on
the target machine.  If you don't define this, the default is two
words.

<br><dt><code>WIDEST_HARDWARE_FP_SIZE</code>
<dd>A C expression for the size in bits of the widest floating-point format
supported by the hardware.  If you define this macro, you must specify a
value less than or equal to the value of <code>LONG_DOUBLE_TYPE_SIZE</code>. 
If you do not define this macro, the value of <code>LONG_DOUBLE_TYPE_SIZE</code>
is the default.

<br><dt><code>DEFAULT_SIGNED_CHAR</code>
<dd>An expression whose value is 1 or 0, according to whether the type
<code>char</code> should be signed or unsigned by default.  The user can
always override this default with the options <code>-fsigned-char</code>
and <code>-funsigned-char</code>.

<br><dt><code>DEFAULT_SHORT_ENUMS</code>
<dd>A C expression to determine whether to give an <code>enum</code> type
only as many bytes as it takes to represent the range of possible values
of that type.  A nonzero value means to do that; a zero value means all
<code>enum</code> types should be allocated like <code>int</code>.

<p>If you don't define the macro, the default is 0.

<br><dt><code>SIZE_TYPE</code>
<dd>A C expression for a string describing the name of the data type to use
for size values.  The typedef name <code>size_t</code> is defined using the
contents of the string.

<p>The string can contain more than one keyword.  If so, separate them with
spaces, and write first any length keyword, then <code>unsigned</code> if
appropriate, and finally <code>int</code>.  The string must exactly match one
of the data type names defined in the function
<code>init_decl_processing</code> in the file <code>c-decl.c</code>.  You may not
omit <code>int</code> or change the order--that would cause the compiler to
crash on startup.

<p>If you don't define this macro, the default is <code>"long unsigned
int"</code>.

<br><dt><code>PTRDIFF_TYPE</code>
<dd>A C expression for a string describing the name of the data type to use
for the result of subtracting two pointers.  The typedef name
<code>ptrdiff_t</code> is defined using the contents of the string.  See
<code>SIZE_TYPE</code> above for more information.

<p>If you don't define this macro, the default is <code>"long int"</code>.

<br><dt><code>WCHAR_TYPE</code>
<dd>A C expression for a string describing the name of the data type to use
for wide characters.  The typedef name <code>wchar_t</code> is defined using
the contents of the string.  See <code>SIZE_TYPE</code> above for more
information.

<p>If you don't define this macro, the default is <code>"int"</code>.

<br><dt><code>WCHAR_TYPE_SIZE</code>
<dd>A C expression for the size in bits of the data type for wide
characters.  This is used in <code>cpp</code>, which cannot make use of
<code>WCHAR_TYPE</code>.

<br><dt><code>MAX_WCHAR_TYPE_SIZE</code>
<dd>Maximum number for the size in bits of the data type for wide
characters.  If this is undefined, the default is
<code>WCHAR_TYPE_SIZE</code>.  Otherwise, it is the constant value that is the
largest value that <code>WCHAR_TYPE_SIZE</code> can have at run-time.  This is
used in <code>cpp</code>.

<br><dt><code>OBJC_INT_SELECTORS</code>
<dd>Define this macro if the type of Objective C selectors should be
<code>int</code>.

<p>If this macro is not defined, then selectors should have the type
<code>struct objc_selector *</code>.

<br><dt><code>OBJC_SELECTORS_WITHOUT_LABELS</code>
<dd>Define this macro if the compiler can group all the selectors together
into a vector and use just one label at the beginning of the vector. 
Otherwise, the compiler must give each selector its own assembler
label.

<p>On certain machines, it is important to have a separate label for each
selector because this enables the linker to eliminate duplicate selectors.

<br><dt><code>TARGET_BELL</code>
<dd>A C constant expression for the integer value for escape sequence
<code>\a</code>.

<br><dt><code>TARGET_BS</code>
<dt><code>TARGET_TAB</code>
<dt><code>TARGET_NEWLINE</code>
<dd>C constant expressions for the integer values for escape sequences
<code>\b</code>, <code>\t</code> and <code>\n</code>.

<br><dt><code>TARGET_VT</code>
<dt><code>TARGET_FF</code>
<dt><code>TARGET_CR</code>
<dd>C constant expressions for the integer values for escape sequences
<code>\v</code>, <code>\f</code> and <code>\r</code>.

<h2>Register Usage</h2>

<p>This section explains how to describe what registers the target machine
has, and how (in general) they can be used.

<p>The description of which registers a specific instruction can use is

on using registers to access a stack frame, see <a href="#Frame%20Registers">Frame Registers</a>.

<h3>Basic Characteristics of Registers</h3>

<p>Registers have various characteristics.

<dl>
<dt><code>FIRST_PSEUDO_REGISTER</code>
<dd>Number of hardware registers known to the compiler.  They receive
numbers 0 through <code>FIRST_PSEUDO_REGISTER-1</code>; thus, the first
pseudo register's number really is assigned the number
<code>FIRST_PSEUDO_REGISTER</code>.

<br><dt><code>FIXED_REGISTERS</code>
<dd>An initializer that says which registers are used for fixed purposes
all throughout the compiled code and are therefore not available for
general allocation.  These would include the stack pointer, the frame
pointer (except on machines where that can be used as a general
register when no frame pointer is needed), the program counter on
machines where that is considered one of the addressable registers,
and any other numbered register with a standard use.

<p>This information is expressed as a sequence of numbers, separated by
commas and surrounded by braces.  The <var>n</var>th number is 1 if
register <var>n</var> is fixed, 0 otherwise.

<p>The table initialized from this macro, and the table initialized by
the following one, may be overridden at run time either automatically,
by the actions of the macro <code>CONDITIONAL_REGISTER_USAGE</code>, or by
the user with the command options <code>-ffixed-<var>reg</var></code>,
<code>-fcall-used-<var>reg</var></code> and <code>-fcall-saved-<var>reg</var></code>.

<br><dt><code>CALL_USED_REGISTERS</code>
<dd>Like <code>FIXED_REGISTERS</code> but has 1 for each register that is
clobbered (in general) by function calls as well as for fixed
registers.  This macro therefore identifies the registers that are not
available for general allocation of values that must live across
function calls.

<p>If a register has 0 in <code>CALL_USED_REGISTERS</code>, the compiler
automatically saves it on function entry and restores it on function
exit, if the register is used within the function.

<br><dt><code>HARD_REGNO_CALL_PART_CLOBBERED (<var>regno</var>, <var>mode</var>)</code>
<dd>A C expression that is non-zero if it is not permissible to store a
value of mode <var>mode</var> in hard register number <var>regno</var> across a
call without some part of it being clobbered.  For most machines this
macro need not be defined.  It is only required for machines that do not
preserve the entire contents of a register across a call.

<br><dt><code>CONDITIONAL_REGISTER_USAGE</code>
<dd>Zero or more C statements that may conditionally modify four variables
<code>fixed_regs</code>, <code>call_used_regs</code>, <code>global_regs</code>
(these three are of type <code>char []</code>) and <code>reg_class_contents</code>
(of type <code>HARD_REG_SET</code>). 
Before the macro is called <code>fixed_regs</code>, <code>call_used_regs</code>
and <code>reg_class_contents</code> have been initialized from
<code>FIXED_REGISTERS</code>, <code>CALL_USED_REGISTERS</code> and
<code>REG_CLASS_CONTENTS</code>, respectively,
<code>global_regs</code> has been cleared, and any <code>-ffixed-<var>reg</var></code>,
<code>-fcall-used-<var>reg</var></code> and <code>-fcall-saved-<var>reg</var></code> command
options have been applied.

<p>This is necessary in case the fixed or call-clobbered registers depend
on target flags.

<p>You need not define this macro if it has no work to do.

<p>If the usage of an entire class of registers depends on the target
flags, you may indicate this to GCC by using this macro to modify
<code>fixed_regs</code> and <code>call_used_regs</code> to 1 for each of the
registers in the classes which should not be used by GCC.  Also define
the macro <code>REG_CLASS_FROM_LETTER</code> to return <code>NO_REGS</code> if it
is called with a letter for a class that shouldn't be used.

<p>(However, if this class is not included in <code>GENERAL_REGS</code> and all
of the insn patterns whose constraints permit this class are
controlled by target switches, then GCC will automatically avoid using
these registers when the target switches are opposed to them.)

<br><dt><code>NON_SAVING_SETJMP</code>
<dd>If this macro is defined and has a nonzero value, it means that
<code>setjmp</code> and related functions fail to save the registers, or that
<code>longjmp</code> fails to restore them.  To compensate, the compiler
avoids putting variables in registers in functions that use
<code>setjmp</code>.

<br><dt><code>INCOMING_REGNO (<var>out</var>)</code>
<dd>Define this macro if the target machine has register windows.  This C
expression returns the register number as seen by the called function
corresponding to the register number <var>out</var> as seen by the calling
function.  Return <var>out</var> if register number <var>out</var> is not an
outbound register.

<br><dt><code>OUTGOING_REGNO (<var>in</var>)</code>
<dd>Define this macro if the target machine has register windows.  This C
expression returns the register number as seen by the calling function
corresponding to the register number <var>in</var> as seen by the called
function.  Return <var>in</var> if register number <var>in</var> is not an inbound
register.

<h3>Order of Allocation of Registers</h3>

<p>Registers are allocated in order.

<dl>
<dt><code>REG_ALLOC_ORDER</code>
<dd>If defined, an initializer for a vector of integers, containing the
numbers of hard registers in the order in which GNU CC should prefer
to use them (from most preferred to least).

<p>If this macro is not defined, registers are used lowest numbered first
(all else being equal).

<p>One use of this macro is on machines where the highest numbered
registers must always be saved and the save-multiple-registers
instruction supports only sequences of consecutive registers.  On such
machines, define <code>REG_ALLOC_ORDER</code> to be an initializer that lists
the highest numbered allocable register first.

<br><dt><code>ORDER_REGS_FOR_LOCAL_ALLOC</code>
<dd>A C statement (sans semicolon) to choose the order in which to allocate
hard registers for pseudo-registers local to a basic block.

<p>Store the desired register order in the array <code>reg_alloc_order</code>. 
Element 0 should be the register to allocate first; element 1, the next
register; and so on.

<p>The macro body should not assume anything about the contents of
<code>reg_alloc_order</code> before execution of the macro.

<p>On most machines, it is not necessary to define this macro.

<h3>How Values Fit in Registers</h3>

<p>This section discusses the macros that describe which kinds of values
(specifically, which machine modes) each register can hold, and how many
consecutive registers are needed for a given mode.

<dl>
<dt><code>HARD_REGNO_NREGS (<var>regno</var>, <var>mode</var>)</code>
<dd>A C expression for the number of consecutive hard registers, starting
at register number <var>regno</var>, required to hold a value of mode
<var>mode</var>.

<p>On a machine where all registers are exactly one word, a suitable
definition of this macro is

<pre>#define HARD_REGNO_NREGS(REGNO, MODE)            \
   ((GET_MODE_SIZE (MODE) + UNITS_PER_WORD - 1)  \
    / UNITS_PER_WORD))
</pre>

<br><dt><code>ALTER_HARD_SUBREG (<var>tgt_mode</var>, <var>word</var>, <var>src_mode</var>, <var>regno</var>)</code>
<dd>A C expression that returns an adjusted hard register number for

<pre>(subreg:<var>tgt_mode</var> (reg:<var>src_mode</var> <var>regno</var>) <var>word</var>)
</pre>

<p>This may be needed if the target machine has mixed sized big-endian
registers, like Sparc v9.

<br><dt><code>HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK (<var>regno</var>, <var>mode</var>)</code>
<dd>A C expression that is nonzero if it is permissible to store a value
of mode <var>mode</var> in hard register number <var>regno</var> (or in several
registers starting with that one).  For a machine where all registers
are equivalent, a suitable definition is

<pre>#define HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK(REGNO, MODE) 1
</pre>

<p>You need not include code to check for the numbers of fixed registers,
because the allocation mechanism considers them to be always occupied.

<p>On some machines, double-precision values must be kept in even/odd
register pairs.  You can implement that by defining this macro to reject
odd register numbers for such modes.

<p>The minimum requirement for a mode to be OK in a register is that the
<code>mov<var>mode</var></code> instruction pattern support moves between the
register and other hard register in the same class and that moving a
value into the register and back out not alter it.

<p>Since the same instruction used to move <code>word_mode</code> will work for
all narrower integer modes, it is not necessary on any machine for
<code>HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK</code> to distinguish between these modes, provided
you define patterns <code>movhi</code>, etc., to take advantage of this.  This
is useful because of the interaction between <code>HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK</code>
and <code>MODES_TIEABLE_P</code>; it is very desirable for all integer modes
to be tieable.

<p>Many machines have special registers for floating point arithmetic. 
Often people assume that floating point machine modes are allowed only
in floating point registers.  This is not true.  Any registers that
can hold integers can safely <em>hold</em> a floating point machine
mode, whether or not floating arithmetic can be done on it in those
registers.  Integer move instructions can be used to move the values.

<p>On some machines, though, the converse is true: fixed-point machine
modes may not go in floating registers.  This is true if the floating
registers normalize any value stored in them, because storing a
non-floating value there would garble it.  In this case,
<code>HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK</code> should reject fixed-point machine modes in
floating registers.  But if the floating registers do not automatically
normalize, if you can store any bit pattern in one and retrieve it
unchanged without a trap, then any machine mode may go in a floating
register, so you can define this macro to say so.

<p>The primary significance of special floating registers is rather that
they are the registers acceptable in floating point arithmetic
instructions.  However, this is of no concern to
<code>HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK</code>.  You handle it by writing the proper
constraints for those instructions.

<p>On some machines, the floating registers are especially slow to access,
so that it is better to store a value in a stack frame than in such a
register if floating point arithmetic is not being done.  As long as the
floating registers are not in class <code>GENERAL_REGS</code>, they will not
be used unless some pattern's constraint asks for one.

<br><dt><code>MODES_TIEABLE_P (<var>mode1</var>, <var>mode2</var>)</code>
<dd>A C expression that is nonzero if a value of mode
<var>mode1</var> is accessible in mode <var>mode2</var> without copying.

<p>If <code>HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK (<var>r</var>, <var>mode1</var>)</code> and
<code>HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK (<var>r</var>, <var>mode2</var>)</code> are always the same for
any <var>r</var>, then <code>MODES_TIEABLE_P (<var>mode1</var>, <var>mode2</var>)</code>
should be nonzero.  If they differ for any <var>r</var>, you should define
this macro to return zero unless some other mechanism ensures the
accessibility of the value in a narrower mode.

<p>You should define this macro to return nonzero in as many cases as
possible since doing so will allow GNU CC to perform better register
allocation.

<br><dt><code>AVOID_CCMODE_COPIES</code>
<dd>Define this macro if the compiler should avoid copies to/from <code>CCmode</code>
registers.  You should only define this macro if support fo copying to/from
<code>CCmode</code> is incomplete.

<h3>Handling Leaf Functions</h3>

<p>On some machines, a leaf function (i.e., one which makes no calls) can run
more efficiently if it does not make its own register window.  Often this
means it is required to receive its arguments in the registers where they
are passed by the caller, instead of the registers where they would
normally arrive.

<p>The special treatment for leaf functions generally applies only when
other conditions are met; for example, often they may use only those
registers for its own variables and temporaries.  We use the term "leaf
function" to mean a function that is suitable for this special
handling, so that functions with no calls are not necessarily "leaf
functions".

<p>GNU CC assigns register numbers before it knows whether the function is
suitable for leaf function treatment.  So it needs to renumber the
registers in order to output a leaf function.  The following macros
accomplish this.

<dl>
<dt><code>LEAF_REGISTERS</code>
<dd>A C initializer for a vector, indexed by hard register number, which
contains 1 for a register that is allowable in a candidate for leaf
function treatment.

<p>If leaf function treatment involves renumbering the registers, then the
registers marked here should be the ones before renumbering--those that
GNU CC would ordinarily allocate.  The registers which will actually be
used in the assembler code, after renumbering, should not be marked with 1
in this vector.

<p>Define this macro only if the target machine offers a way to optimize
the treatment of leaf functions.

<br><dt><code>LEAF_REG_REMAP (<var>regno</var>)</code>
<dd>A C expression whose value is the register number to which <var>regno</var>
should be renumbered, when a function is treated as a leaf function.

<p>If <var>regno</var> is a register number which should not appear in a leaf
function before renumbering, then the expression should yield -1, which
will cause the compiler to abort.

<p>Define this macro only if the target machine offers a way to optimize the
treatment of leaf functions, and registers need to be renumbered to do
this. 
</dl>

<p>Normally, <code>FUNCTION_PROLOGUE</code> and <code>FUNCTION_EPILOGUE</code> must
treat leaf functions specially.  They can test the C variable
<code>current_function_is_leaf</code> which is nonzero for leaf functions. 
<code>current_function_is_leaf</code> is set prior to local register allocation
and is valid for the remaining compiler passes.  They can also test the C
variable <code>current_function_uses_only_leaf_regs</code> which is nonzero for
leaf functions which only use leaf registers. 
<code>current_function_uses_only_leaf_regs</code> is valid after reload and is
only useful if <code>LEAF_REGISTERS</code> is defined.

<h3>Registers That Form a Stack</h3>

<p>There are special features to handle computers where some of the
"registers" form a stack, as in the 80387 coprocessor for the 80386. 
Stack registers are normally written by pushing onto the stack, and are
numbered relative to the top of the stack.

<p>Currently, GNU CC can only handle one group of stack-like registers, and
they must be consecutively numbered.

<dl>
<dt><code>STACK_REGS</code>
<dd>Define this if the machine has any stack-like registers.

<br><dt><code>FIRST_STACK_REG</code>
<dd>The number of the first stack-like register.  This one is the top
of the stack.

<br><dt><code>LAST_STACK_REG</code>
<dd>The number of the last stack-like register.  This one is the bottom of
the stack.

<h3>Obsolete Macros for Controlling Register Usage</h3>

<p>These features do not work very well.  They exist because they used to
be required to generate correct code for the 80387 coprocessor of the
80386.  They are no longer used by that machine description and may be
removed in a later version of the compiler.  Don't use them!

<dl>
<dt><code>OVERLAPPING_REGNO_P (<var>regno</var>)</code>
<dd>If defined, this is a C expression whose value is nonzero if hard
register number <var>regno</var> is an overlapping register.  This means a
hard register which overlaps a hard register with a different number. 
(Such overlap is undesirable, but occasionally it allows a machine to
be supported which otherwise could not be.)  This macro must return
nonzero for <em>all</em> the registers which overlap each other.  GNU CC
can use an overlapping register only in certain limited ways.  It can
be used for allocation within a basic block, and may be spilled for
reloading; that is all.

<p>If this macro is not defined, it means that none of the hard registers
overlap each other.  This is the usual situation.

<br><dt><code>INSN_CLOBBERS_REGNO_P (<var>insn</var>, <var>regno</var>)</code>
<dd>If defined, this is a C expression whose value should be nonzero if
the insn <var>insn</var> has the effect of mysteriously clobbering the
contents of hard register number <var>regno</var>.  By "mysterious" we
mean that the insn's RTL expression doesn't describe such an effect.

<p>If this macro is not defined, it means that no insn clobbers registers
mysteriously.  This is the usual situation; all else being equal,
it is best for the RTL expression to show all the activity.

<h2>Register Classes</h2>

<p>On many machines, the numbered registers are not all equivalent. 
For example, certain registers may not be allowed for indexed addressing;
certain registers may not be allowed in some instructions.  These machine
restrictions are described to the compiler using <dfn>register classes</dfn>.

<p>You define a number of register classes, giving each one a name and saying
which of the registers belong to it.  Then you can specify register classes
that are allowed as operands to particular instruction patterns.

<p>In general, each register will belong to several classes.  In fact, one
class must be named <code>ALL_REGS</code> and contain all the registers.  Another
class must be named <code>NO_REGS</code> and contain no registers.  Often the
union of two classes will be another class; however, this is not required.

<p>One of the classes must be named <code>GENERAL_REGS</code>.  There is nothing
terribly special about the name, but the operand constraint letters
<code>r</code> and <code>g</code> specify this class.  If <code>GENERAL_REGS</code> is
the same as <code>ALL_REGS</code>, just define it as a macro which expands
to <code>ALL_REGS</code>.

<p>Order the classes so that if class <var>x</var> is contained in class <var>y</var>
then <var>x</var> has a lower class number than <var>y</var>.

<p>The way classes other than <code>GENERAL_REGS</code> are specified in operand
constraints is through machine-dependent operand constraint letters. 
You can define such letters to correspond to various classes, then use
them in operand constraints.

<p>You should define a class for the union of two classes whenever some
instruction allows both classes.  For example, if an instruction allows
either a floating point (coprocessor) register or a general register for a
certain operand, you should define a class <code>FLOAT_OR_GENERAL_REGS</code>
which includes both of them.  Otherwise you will get suboptimal code.

<p>You must also specify certain redundant information about the register
classes: for each class, which classes contain it and which ones are
contained in it; for each pair of classes, the largest class contained
in their union.

<p>When a value occupying several consecutive registers is expected in a
certain class, all the registers used must belong to that class. 
Therefore, register classes cannot be used to enforce a requirement for
a register pair to start with an even-numbered register.  The way to
specify this requirement is with <code>HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK</code>.

<p>Register classes used for input-operands of bitwise-and or shift
instructions have a special requirement: each such class must have, for
each fixed-point machine mode, a subclass whose registers can transfer that
mode to or from memory.  For example, on some machines, the operations for
single-byte values (<code>QImode</code>) are limited to certain registers.  When
this is so, each register class that is used in a bitwise-and or shift
instruction must have a subclass consisting of registers from which
single-byte values can be loaded or stored.  This is so that
<code>PREFERRED_RELOAD_CLASS</code> can always have a possible value to return.

<dl>
<dt><code>enum reg_class</code>
<dd>An enumeral type that must be defined with all the register class names
as enumeral values.  <code>NO_REGS</code> must be first.  <code>ALL_REGS</code>
must be the last register class, followed by one more enumeral value,
<code>LIM_REG_CLASSES</code>, which is not a register class but rather
tells how many classes there are.

<p>Each register class has a number, which is the value of casting
the class name to type <code>int</code>.  The number serves as an index
in many of the tables described below.

<br><dt><code>N_REG_CLASSES</code>
<dd>The number of distinct register classes, defined as follows:

<pre>#define N_REG_CLASSES (int) LIM_REG_CLASSES
</pre>

<br><dt><code>REG_CLASS_NAMES</code>
<dd>An initializer containing the names of the register classes as C string
constants.  These names are used in writing some of the debugging dumps.

<br><dt><code>REG_CLASS_CONTENTS</code>
<dd>An initializer containing the contents of the register classes, as integers
which are bit masks.  The <var>n</var>th integer specifies the contents of class
<var>n</var>.  The way the integer <var>mask</var> is interpreted is that
register <var>r</var> is in the class if <code><var>mask</var> &amp; (1 &lt;&lt; <var>r</var>)</code> is 1.

<p>When the machine has more than 32 registers, an integer does not suffice. 
Then the integers are replaced by sub-initializers, braced groupings containing
several integers.  Each sub-initializer must be suitable as an initializer
for the type <code>HARD_REG_SET</code> which is defined in <code>hard-reg-set.h</code>.

<br><dt><code>REGNO_REG_CLASS (<var>regno</var>)</code>
<dd>A C expression whose value is a register class containing hard register
<var>regno</var>.  In general there is more than one such class; choose a class
which is <dfn>minimal</dfn>, meaning that no smaller class also contains the
register.

<br><dt><code>BASE_REG_CLASS</code>
<dd>A macro whose definition is the name of the class to which a valid
base register must belong.  A base register is one used in an address
which is the register value plus a displacement.

<br><dt><code>INDEX_REG_CLASS</code>
<dd>A macro whose definition is the name of the class to which a valid
index register must belong.  An index register is one used in an
address where its value is either multiplied by a scale factor or
added to another register (as well as added to a displacement).

<br><dt><code>REG_CLASS_FROM_LETTER (<var>char</var>)</code>
<dd>A C expression which defines the machine-dependent operand constraint
letters for register classes.  If <var>char</var> is such a letter, the
value should be the register class corresponding to it.  Otherwise,
the value should be <code>NO_REGS</code>.  The register letter <code>r</code>,
corresponding to class <code>GENERAL_REGS</code>, will not be passed
to this macro; you do not need to handle it.

<br><dt><code>REGNO_OK_FOR_BASE_P (<var>num</var>)</code>
<dd>A C expression which is nonzero if register number <var>num</var> is
suitable for use as a base register in operand addresses.  It may be
either a suitable hard register or a pseudo register that has been
allocated such a hard register.

<br><dt><code>REGNO_MODE_OK_FOR_BASE_P (<var>num</var>, <var>mode</var>)</code>
<dd>A C expression that is just like <code>REGNO_OK_FOR_BASE_P</code>, except that
that expression may examine the mode of the memory reference in
<var>mode</var>.  You should define this macro if the mode of the memory
reference affects whether a register may be used as a base register.  If
you define this macro, the compiler will use it instead of
<code>REGNO_OK_FOR_BASE_P</code>.

<br><dt><code>REGNO_OK_FOR_INDEX_P (<var>num</var>)</code>
<dd>A C expression which is nonzero if register number <var>num</var> is
suitable for use as an index register in operand addresses.  It may be
either a suitable hard register or a pseudo register that has been
allocated such a hard register.

<p>The difference between an index register and a base register is that
the index register may be scaled.  If an address involves the sum of
two registers, neither one of them scaled, then either one may be
labeled the "base" and the other the "index"; but whichever
labeling is used must fit the machine's constraints of which registers
may serve in each capacity.  The compiler will try both labelings,
looking for one that is valid, and will reload one or both registers
only if neither labeling works.

<br><dt><code>PREFERRED_RELOAD_CLASS (<var>x</var>, <var>class</var>)</code>
<dd>A C expression that places additional restrictions on the register class
to use when it is necessary to copy value <var>x</var> into a register in class
<var>class</var>.  The value is a register class; perhaps <var>class</var>, or perhaps
another, smaller class.  On many machines, the following definition is
safe:

<pre>#define PREFERRED_RELOAD_CLASS(X,CLASS) CLASS
</pre>

<p>Sometimes returning a more restrictive class makes better code.  For
example, on the 68000, when <var>x</var> is an integer constant that is in range
for a <code>moveq</code> instruction, the value of this macro is always
<code>DATA_REGS</code> as long as <var>class</var> includes the data registers. 
Requiring a data register guarantees that a <code>moveq</code> will be used.

<p>If <var>x</var> is a <code>const_double</code>, by returning <code>NO_REGS</code>
you can force <var>x</var> into a memory constant.  This is useful on
certain machines where immediate floating values cannot be loaded into
certain kinds of registers.

<br><dt><code>PREFERRED_OUTPUT_RELOAD_CLASS (<var>x</var>, <var>class</var>)</code>
<dd>Like <code>PREFERRED_RELOAD_CLASS</code>, but for output reloads instead of
input reloads.  If you don't define this macro, the default is to use
<var>class</var>, unchanged.

<br><dt><code>LIMIT_RELOAD_CLASS (<var>mode</var>, <var>class</var>)</code>
<dd>A C expression that places additional restrictions on the register class
to use when it is necessary to be able to hold a value of mode
<var>mode</var> in a reload register for which class <var>class</var> would
ordinarily be used.

<p>Unlike <code>PREFERRED_RELOAD_CLASS</code>, this macro should be used when
there are certain modes that simply can't go in certain reload classes.

<p>The value is a register class; perhaps <var>class</var>, or perhaps another,
smaller class.

<p>Don't define this macro unless the target machine has limitations which
require the macro to do something nontrivial.

<br><dt><code>SECONDARY_RELOAD_CLASS (<var>class</var>, <var>mode</var>, <var>x</var>)</code>
<dt><code>SECONDARY_INPUT_RELOAD_CLASS (<var>class</var>, <var>mode</var>, <var>x</var>)</code>
<dt><code>SECONDARY_OUTPUT_RELOAD_CLASS (<var>class</var>, <var>mode</var>, <var>x</var>)</code>
<dd>Many machines have some registers that cannot be copied directly to or
from memory or even from other types of registers.  An example is the
<code>MQ</code> register, which on most machines, can only be copied to or
from general registers, but not memory.  Some machines allow copying all
registers to and from memory, but require a scratch register for stores
to some memory locations (e.g., those with symbolic address on the RT,
and those with certain symbolic address on the Sparc when compiling
PIC).  In some cases, both an intermediate and a scratch register are
required.

<p>You should define these macros to indicate to the reload phase that it may
need to allocate at least one register for a reload in addition to the
register to contain the data.  Specifically, if copying <var>x</var> to a
register <var>class</var> in <var>mode</var> requires an intermediate register,
you should define <code>SECONDARY_INPUT_RELOAD_CLASS</code> to return the
largest register class all of whose registers can be used as
intermediate registers or scratch registers.

<p>If copying a register <var>class</var> in <var>mode</var> to <var>x</var> requires an
intermediate or scratch register, <code>SECONDARY_OUTPUT_RELOAD_CLASS</code>
should be defined to return the largest register class required.  If the
requirements for input and output reloads are the same, the macro
<code>SECONDARY_RELOAD_CLASS</code> should be used instead of defining both
macros identically.

<p>The values returned by these macros are often <code>GENERAL_REGS</code>. 
Return <code>NO_REGS</code> if no spare register is needed; i.e., if <var>x</var>
can be directly copied to or from a register of <var>class</var> in
<var>mode</var> without requiring a scratch register.  Do not define this
macro if it would always return <code>NO_REGS</code>.

<p>If a scratch register is required (either with or without an
intermediate register), you should define patterns for
<code>reload_in<var>m</var></code> or <code>reload_out<var>m</var></code>, as required
(see <a href="#Standard%20Names">Standard Names</a>.  These patterns, which will normally be
implemented with a <code>define_expand</code>, should be similar to the
<code>mov<var>m</var></code> patterns, except that operand 2 is the scratch
register.

<p>Define constraints for the reload register and scratch register that
contain a single register class.  If the original reload register (whose
class is <var>class</var>) can meet the constraint given in the pattern, the
value returned by these macros is used for the class of the scratch
register.  Otherwise, two additional reload registers are required. 
Their classes are obtained from the constraints in the insn pattern.

<p><var>x</var> might be a pseudo-register or a <code>subreg</code> of a
pseudo-register, which could either be in a hard register or in memory. 
Use <code>true_regnum</code> to find out; it will return -1 if the pseudo is
in memory and the hard register number if it is in a register.

<p>These macros should not be used in the case where a particular class of
registers can only be copied to memory and not to another class of
registers.  In that case, secondary reload registers are not needed and
would not be helpful.  Instead, a stack location must be used to perform
the copy and the <code>mov<var>m</var></code> pattern should use memory as a
intermediate storage.  This case often occurs between floating-point and
general registers.

<br><dt><code>SECONDARY_MEMORY_NEEDED (<var>class1</var>, <var>class2</var>, <var>m</var>)</code>
<dd>Certain machines have the property that some registers cannot be copied
to some other registers without using memory.  Define this macro on
those machines to be a C expression that is non-zero if objects of mode
<var>m</var> in registers of <var>class1</var> can only be copied to registers of
class <var>class2</var> by storing a register of <var>class1</var> into memory
and loading that memory location into a register of <var>class2</var>.

<p>Do not define this macro if its value would always be zero.

<br><dt><code>SECONDARY_MEMORY_NEEDED_RTX (<var>mode</var>)</code>
<dd>Normally when <code>SECONDARY_MEMORY_NEEDED</code> is defined, the compiler
allocates a stack slot for a memory location needed for register copies. 
If this macro is defined, the compiler instead uses the memory location
defined by this macro.

<p>Do not define this macro if you do not define
<code>SECONDARY_MEMORY_NEEDED</code>.

<br><dt><code>SECONDARY_MEMORY_NEEDED_MODE (<var>mode</var>)</code>
<dd>When the compiler needs a secondary memory location to copy between two
registers of mode <var>mode</var>, it normally allocates sufficient memory to
hold a quantity of <code>BITS_PER_WORD</code> bits and performs the store and
load operations in a mode that many bits wide and whose class is the
same as that of <var>mode</var>.

<p>This is right thing to do on most machines because it ensures that all
bits of the register are copied and prevents accesses to the registers
in a narrower mode, which some machines prohibit for floating-point
registers.

<p>However, this default behavior is not correct on some machines, such as
the DEC Alpha, that store short integers in floating-point registers
differently than in integer registers.  On those machines, the default
widening will not work correctly and you must define this macro to
suppress that widening in some cases.  See the file <code>alpha.h</code> for
details.

<p>Do not define this macro if you do not define
<code>SECONDARY_MEMORY_NEEDED</code> or if widening <var>mode</var> to a mode that
is <code>BITS_PER_WORD</code> bits wide is correct for your machine.

<br><dt><code>SMALL_REGISTER_CLASSES</code>
<dd>On some machines, it is risky to let hard registers live across arbitrary
insns.  Typically, these machines have instructions that require values
to be in specific registers (like an accumulator), and reload will fail
if the required hard register is used for another purpose across such an
insn.

<p>Define <code>SMALL_REGISTER_CLASSES</code> to be an expression with a non-zero
value on these machines.  When this macro has a non-zero value, the
compiler will try to minimize the lifetime of hard registers.

<p>It is always safe to define this macro with a non-zero value, but if you
unnecessarily define it, you will reduce the amount of optimizations
that can be performed in some cases.  If you do not define this macro
with a non-zero value when it is required, the compiler will run out of
spill registers and print a fatal error message.  For most machines, you
should not define this macro at all.

<br><dt><code>CLASS_LIKELY_SPILLED_P (<var>class</var>)</code>
<dd>A C expression whose value is nonzero if pseudos that have been assigned
to registers of class <var>class</var> would likely be spilled because
registers of <var>class</var> are needed for spill registers.

<p>The default value of this macro returns 1 if <var>class</var> has exactly one
register and zero otherwise.  On most machines, this default should be
used.  Only define this macro to some other expression if pseudos
allocated by <code>local-alloc.c</code> end up in memory because their hard
registers were needed for spill registers.  If this macro returns nonzero
for those classes, those pseudos will only be allocated by
<code>global.c</code>, which knows how to reallocate the pseudo to another
register.  If there would not be another register available for
reallocation, you should not change the definition of this macro since
the only effect of such a definition would be to slow down register
allocation.

<br><dt><code>CLASS_MAX_NREGS (<var>class</var>, <var>mode</var>)</code>
<dd>A C expression for the maximum number of consecutive registers
of class <var>class</var> needed to hold a value of mode <var>mode</var>.

<p>This is closely related to the macro <code>HARD_REGNO_NREGS</code>.  In fact,
the value of the macro <code>CLASS_MAX_NREGS (<var>class</var>, <var>mode</var>)</code>
should be the maximum value of <code>HARD_REGNO_NREGS (<var>regno</var>,
<var>mode</var>)</code> for all <var>regno</var> values in the class <var>class</var>.

<p>This macro helps control the handling of multiple-word values
in the reload pass.

<br><dt><code>CLASS_CANNOT_CHANGE_SIZE</code>
<dd>If defined, a C expression for a class that contains registers which the
compiler must always access in a mode that is the same size as the mode
in which it loaded the register.

<p>For the example, loading 32-bit integer or floating-point objects into
floating-point registers on the Alpha extends them to 64-bits. 
Therefore loading a 64-bit object and then storing it as a 32-bit object
does not store the low-order 32-bits, as would be the case for a normal
register.  Therefore, <code>alpha.h</code> defines this macro as
<code>FLOAT_REGS</code>. 
</dl>

<p>Three other special macros describe which operands fit which constraint
letters.

<dl>
<dt><code>CONST_OK_FOR_LETTER_P (<var>value</var>, <var>c</var>)</code>
<dd>A C expression that defines the machine-dependent operand constraint
letters (<code>I</code>, <code>J</code>, <code>K</code>, <small>...</small> <code>P</code>) that specify
particular ranges of integer values.  If <var>c</var> is one of those
letters, the expression should check that <var>value</var>, an integer, is in
the appropriate range and return 1 if so, 0 otherwise.  If <var>c</var> is
not one of those letters, the value should be 0 regardless of
<var>value</var>.

<br><dt><code>CONST_DOUBLE_OK_FOR_LETTER_P (<var>value</var>, <var>c</var>)</code>
<dd>A C expression that defines the machine-dependent operand constraint
letters that specify particular ranges of <code>const_double</code> values
(<code>G</code> or <code>H</code>).

<p>If <var>c</var> is one of those letters, the expression should check that
<var>value</var>, an RTX of code <code>const_double</code>, is in the appropriate
range and return 1 if so, 0 otherwise.  If <var>c</var> is not one of those
letters, the value should be 0 regardless of <var>value</var>.

<p><code>const_double</code> is used for all floating-point constants and for
<code>DImode</code> fixed-point constants.  A given letter can accept either
or both kinds of values.  It can use <code>GET_MODE</code> to distinguish
between these kinds.

<br><dt><code>EXTRA_CONSTRAINT (<var>value</var>, <var>c</var>)</code>
<dd>A C expression that defines the optional machine-dependent constraint
letters (<code>Q</code>, <code>R</code>, <code>S</code>, <code>T</code>, <code>U</code>) that can
be used to segregate specific types of operands, usually memory
references, for the target machine.  Normally this macro will not be
defined.  If it is required for a particular target machine, it should
return 1 if <var>value</var> corresponds to the operand type represented by
the constraint letter <var>c</var>.  If <var>c</var> is not defined as an extra
constraint, the value returned should be 0 regardless of <var>value</var>.

<p>For example, on the ROMP, load instructions cannot have their output in r0 if
the memory reference contains a symbolic address.  Constraint letter
<code>Q</code> is defined as representing a memory address that does
<em>not</em> contain a symbolic address.  An alternative is specified with
a <code>Q</code> constraint on the input and <code>r</code> on the output.  The next
alternative specifies <code>m</code> on the input and a register class that
does not include r0 on the output.

<h3>Basic Stack Layout</h3>

<p>Here is the basic stack layout.

<dl>
<dt><code>STACK_GROWS_DOWNWARD</code>
<dd>Define this macro if pushing a word onto the stack moves the stack
pointer to a smaller address.

<p>When we say, "define this macro if <small>...</small>," it means that the
compiler checks this macro only with <code>#ifdef</code> so the precise
definition used does not matter.

<br><dt><code>FRAME_GROWS_DOWNWARD</code>
<dd>Define this macro if the addresses of local variable slots are at negative
offsets from the frame pointer.

<br><dt><code>ARGS_GROW_DOWNWARD</code>
<dd>Define this macro if successive arguments to a function occupy decreasing
addresses on the stack.

<br><dt><code>STARTING_FRAME_OFFSET</code>
<dd>Offset from the frame pointer to the first local variable slot to be allocated.

<p>If <code>FRAME_GROWS_DOWNWARD</code>, find the next slot's offset by
subtracting the first slot's length from <code>STARTING_FRAME_OFFSET</code>. 
Otherwise, it is found by adding the length of the first slot to the
value <code>STARTING_FRAME_OFFSET</code>.

<br><dt><code>STACK_POINTER_OFFSET</code>
<dd>Offset from the stack pointer register to the first location at which
outgoing arguments are placed.  If not specified, the default value of
zero is used.  This is the proper value for most machines.

<p>If <code>ARGS_GROW_DOWNWARD</code>, this is the offset to the location above
the first location at which outgoing arguments are placed.

<br><dt><code>FIRST_PARM_OFFSET (<var>fundecl</var>)</code>
<dd>Offset from the argument pointer register to the first argument's
address.  On some machines it may depend on the data type of the
function.

<p>If <code>ARGS_GROW_DOWNWARD</code>, this is the offset to the location above
the first argument's address.

<br><dt><code>STACK_DYNAMIC_OFFSET (<var>fundecl</var>)</code>
<dd>Offset from the stack pointer register to an item dynamically allocated
on the stack, e.g., by <code>alloca</code>.

<p>The default value for this macro is <code>STACK_POINTER_OFFSET</code> plus the
length of the outgoing arguments.  The default is correct for most
machines.  See <code>function.c</code> for details.

<br><dt><code>DYNAMIC_CHAIN_ADDRESS (<var>frameaddr</var>)</code>
<dd>A C expression whose value is RTL representing the address in a stack
frame where the pointer to the caller's frame is stored.  Assume that
<var>frameaddr</var> is an RTL expression for the address of the stack frame
itself.

<p>If you don't define this macro, the default is to return the value
of <var>frameaddr</var>--that is, the stack frame address is also the
address of the stack word that points to the previous frame.

<br><dt><code>SETUP_FRAME_ADDRESSES</code>
<dd>If defined, a C expression that produces the machine-specific code to
setup the stack so that arbitrary frames can be accessed.  For example,
on the Sparc, we must flush all of the register windows to the stack
before we can access arbitrary stack frames.  You will seldom need to
define this macro.

<br><dt><code>BUILTIN_SETJMP_FRAME_VALUE</code>
<dd>If defined, a C expression that contains an rtx that is used to store
the address of the current frame into the built in <code>setjmp</code> buffer. 
The default value, <code>virtual_stack_vars_rtx</code>, is correct for most
machines.  One reason you may need to define this macro is if
<code>hard_frame_pointer_rtx</code> is the appropriate value on your machine.

<br><dt><code>RETURN_ADDR_RTX (<var>count</var>, <var>frameaddr</var>)</code>
<dd>A C expression whose value is RTL representing the value of the return
address for the frame <var>count</var> steps up from the current frame, after
the prologue.  <var>frameaddr</var> is the frame pointer of the <var>count</var>
frame, or the frame pointer of the <var>count</var> - 1 frame if
<code>RETURN_ADDR_IN_PREVIOUS_FRAME</code> is defined.

<p>The value of the expression must always be the correct address when
<var>count</var> is zero, but may be <code>NULL_RTX</code> if there is not way to
determine the return address of other frames.

<br><dt><code>RETURN_ADDR_IN_PREVIOUS_FRAME</code>
<dd>Define this if the return address of a particular stack frame is accessed
from the frame pointer of the previous stack frame.

<br><dt><code>INCOMING_RETURN_ADDR_RTX</code>
<dd>A C expression whose value is RTL representing the location of the
incoming return address at the beginning of any function, before the
prologue.  This RTL is either a <code>REG</code>, indicating that the return
value is saved in <code>REG</code>, or a <code>MEM</code> representing a location in
the stack.

<p>You only need to define this macro if you want to support call frame
debugging information like that provided by DWARF 2.

<br><dt><code>INCOMING_FRAME_SP_OFFSET</code>
<dd>A C expression whose value is an integer giving the offset, in bytes,
from the value of the stack pointer register to the top of the stack
frame at the beginning of any function, before the prologue.  The top of
the frame is defined to be the value of the stack pointer in the
previous frame, just before the call instruction.

<p>You only need to define this macro if you want to support call frame
debugging information like that provided by DWARF 2.

<br><dt><code>ARG_POINTER_CFA_OFFSET</code>
<dd>A C expression whose value is an integer giving the offset, in bytes,
from the argument pointer to the canonical frame address (cfa).  The
final value should coincide with that calculated by
<code>INCOMING_FRAME_SP_OFFSET</code>.  Which is unfortunately not usable
during virtual register instantiation.

<p>You only need to define this macro if you want to support call frame
debugging information like that provided by DWARF 2.

<h3>Specifying How Stack Checking is Done</h3>

<p>GNU CC will check that stack references are within the boundaries of
the stack, if the <code>-fstack-check</code> is specified, in one of three ways:

<ol type=1 start=1>
</p><li>If the value of the <code>STACK_CHECK_BUILTIN</code> macro is nonzero, GNU CC
will assume that you have arranged for stack checking to be done at
appropriate places in the configuration files, e.g., in
<code>FUNCTION_PROLOGUE</code>.  GNU CC will do not other special processing.

<li>If <code>STACK_CHECK_BUILTIN</code> is zero and you defined a named pattern
called <code>check_stack</code> in your <code>md</code> file, GNU CC will call that
pattern with one argument which is the address to compare the stack
value against.  You must arrange for this pattern to report an error if
the stack pointer is out of range.

<li>If neither of the above are true, GNU CC will generate code to periodically
"probe" the stack pointer using the values of the macros defined below.
</ol>

<p>Normally, you will use the default values of these macros, so GNU CC
will use the third approach.

<dl>
<dt><code>STACK_CHECK_BUILTIN</code>
<dd>A nonzero value if stack checking is done by the configuration files in a
machine-dependent manner.  You should define this macro if stack checking
is require by the ABI of your machine or if you would like to have to stack
checking in some more efficient way than GNU CC's portable approach. 
The default value of this macro is zero.

<br><dt><code>STACK_CHECK_PROBE_INTERVAL</code>
<dd>An integer representing the interval at which GNU CC must generate stack
probe instructions.  You will normally define this macro to be no larger
than the size of the "guard pages" at the end of a stack area.  The
default value of 4096 is suitable for most systems.

<br><dt><code>STACK_CHECK_PROBE_LOAD</code>
<dd>A integer which is nonzero if GNU CC should perform the stack probe
as a load instruction and zero if GNU CC should use a store instruction. 
The default is zero, which is the most efficient choice on most systems.

<br><dt><code>STACK_CHECK_PROTECT</code>
<dd>The number of bytes of stack needed to recover from a stack overflow,
for languages where such a recovery is supported.  The default value of
75 words should be adequate for most machines.

<br><dt><code>STACK_CHECK_MAX_FRAME_SIZE</code>
<dd>The maximum size of a stack frame, in bytes.  GNU CC will generate probe
instructions in non-leaf functions to ensure at least this many bytes of
stack are available.  If a stack frame is larger than this size, stack
checking will not be reliable and GNU CC will issue a warning.  The
default is chosen so that GNU CC only generates one instruction on most
systems.  You should normally not change the default value of this macro.

<br><dt><code>STACK_CHECK_FIXED_FRAME_SIZE</code>
<dd>GNU CC uses this value to generate the above warning message.  It
represents the amount of fixed frame used by a function, not including
space for any callee-saved registers, temporaries and user variables. 
You need only specify an upper bound for this amount and will normally
use the default of four words.

<br><dt><code>STACK_CHECK_MAX_VAR_SIZE</code>
<dd>The maximum size, in bytes, of an object that GNU CC will place in the
fixed area of the stack frame when the user specifies
<code>-fstack-check</code>. 
GNU CC computed the default from the values of the above macros and you will
normally not need to override that default.

<h3>Registers That Address the Stack Frame</h3>

<p>This discusses registers that address the stack frame.

<dl>
<dt><code>STACK_POINTER_REGNUM</code>
<dd>The register number of the stack pointer register, which must also be a
fixed register according to <code>FIXED_REGISTERS</code>.  On most machines,
the hardware determines which register this is.

<br><dt><code>FRAME_POINTER_REGNUM</code>
<dd>The register number of the frame pointer register, which is used to
access automatic variables in the stack frame.  On some machines, the
hardware determines which register this is.  On other machines, you can
choose any register you wish for this purpose.

<br><dt><code>HARD_FRAME_POINTER_REGNUM</code>
<dd>On some machines the offset between the frame pointer and starting
offset of the automatic variables is not known until after register
allocation has been done (for example, because the saved registers are
between these two locations).  On those machines, define
<code>FRAME_POINTER_REGNUM</code> the number of a special, fixed register to
be used internally until the offset is known, and define
<code>HARD_FRAME_POINTER_REGNUM</code> to be the actual hard register number
used for the frame pointer.

<p>You should define this macro only in the very rare circumstances when it
is not possible to calculate the offset between the frame pointer and
the automatic variables until after register allocation has been
completed.  When this macro is defined, you must also indicate in your
definition of <code>ELIMINABLE_REGS</code> how to eliminate
<code>FRAME_POINTER_REGNUM</code> into either <code>HARD_FRAME_POINTER_REGNUM</code>
or <code>STACK_POINTER_REGNUM</code>.

<p>Do not define this macro if it would be the same as
<code>FRAME_POINTER_REGNUM</code>.

<br><dt><code>ARG_POINTER_REGNUM</code>
<dd>The register number of the arg pointer register, which is used to access
the function's argument list.  On some machines, this is the same as the
frame pointer register.  On some machines, the hardware determines which
register this is.  On other machines, you can choose any register you
wish for this purpose.  If this is not the same register as the frame
pointer register, then you must mark it as a fixed register according to
<code>FIXED_REGISTERS</code>, or arrange to be able to eliminate it
(see <a href="#Elimination">Elimination</a>).

<br><dt><code>RETURN_ADDRESS_POINTER_REGNUM</code>
<dd>The register number of the return address pointer register, which is used to
access the current function's return address from the stack.  On some
machines, the return address is not at a fixed offset from the frame
pointer or stack pointer or argument pointer.  This register can be defined
to point to the return address on the stack, and then be converted by
<code>ELIMINABLE_REGS</code> into either the frame pointer or stack pointer.

<p>Do not define this macro unless there is no other way to get the return
address from the stack.

<br><dt><code>STATIC_CHAIN_REGNUM</code>
<dt><code>STATIC_CHAIN_INCOMING_REGNUM</code>
<dd>Register numbers used for passing a function's static chain pointer.  If
register windows are used, the register number as seen by the called
function is <code>STATIC_CHAIN_INCOMING_REGNUM</code>, while the register
number as seen by the calling function is <code>STATIC_CHAIN_REGNUM</code>.  If
these registers are the same, <code>STATIC_CHAIN_INCOMING_REGNUM</code> need
not be defined.

<p>The static chain register need not be a fixed register.

<p>If the static chain is passed in memory, these macros should not be
defined; instead, the next two macros should be defined.

<br><dt><code>STATIC_CHAIN</code>
<dt><code>STATIC_CHAIN_INCOMING</code>
<dd>If the static chain is passed in memory, these macros provide rtx giving
<code>mem</code> expressions that denote where they are stored. 
<code>STATIC_CHAIN</code> and <code>STATIC_CHAIN_INCOMING</code> give the locations
as seen by the calling and called functions, respectively.  Often the former
will be at an offset from the stack pointer and the latter at an offset from
the frame pointer.

<p>The variables <code>stack_pointer_rtx</code>, <code>frame_pointer_rtx</code>, and
<code>arg_pointer_rtx</code> will have been initialized prior to the use of these
macros and should be used to refer to those items.

<p>If the static chain is passed in a register, the two previous macros should
be defined instead.

<br>

<h3>Eliminating Frame Pointer and Arg Pointer</h3>

<p>This is about eliminating the frame pointer and arg pointer.

<dl>
<dt><code>FRAME_POINTER_REQUIRED</code>
<dd>A C expression which is nonzero if a function must have and use a frame
pointer.  This expression is evaluated  in the reload pass.  If its value is
nonzero the function will have a frame pointer.

<p>The expression can in principle examine the current function and decide
according to the facts, but on most machines the constant 0 or the
constant 1 suffices.  Use 0 when the machine allows code to be generated
with no frame pointer, and doing so saves some time or space.  Use 1
when there is no possible advantage to avoiding a frame pointer.

<p>In certain cases, the compiler does not know how to produce valid code
without a frame pointer.  The compiler recognizes those cases and
automatically gives the function a frame pointer regardless of what
<code>FRAME_POINTER_REQUIRED</code> says.  You don't need to worry about
them.

<p>In a function that does not require a frame pointer, the frame pointer
register can be allocated for ordinary usage, unless you mark it as a
fixed register.  See <code>FIXED_REGISTERS</code> for more information.

<br><dt><code>INITIAL_FRAME_POINTER_OFFSET (<var>depth-var</var>)</code>
<dd>A C statement to store in the variable <var>depth-var</var> the difference
between the frame pointer and the stack pointer values immediately after
the function prologue.  The value would be computed from information
such as the result of <code>get_frame_size ()</code> and the tables of
registers <code>regs_ever_live</code> and <code>call_used_regs</code>.

<p>If <code>ELIMINABLE_REGS</code> is defined, this macro will be not be used and
need not be defined.  Otherwise, it must be defined even if
<code>FRAME_POINTER_REQUIRED</code> is defined to always be true; in that
case, you may set <var>depth-var</var> to anything.

<br><dt><code>ELIMINABLE_REGS</code>
<dd>If defined, this macro specifies a table of register pairs used to
eliminate unneeded registers that point into the stack frame.  If it is not
defined, the only elimination attempted by the compiler is to replace
references to the frame pointer with references to the stack pointer.

<p>The definition of this macro is a list of structure initializations, each
of which specifies an original and replacement register.

<p>On some machines, the position of the argument pointer is not known until
the compilation is completed.  In such a case, a separate hard register
must be used for the argument pointer.  This register can be eliminated by
replacing it with either the frame pointer or the argument pointer,
depending on whether or not the frame pointer has been eliminated.

<p>In this case, you might specify:
<pre>#define ELIMINABLE_REGS  \
{{ARG_POINTER_REGNUM, STACK_POINTER_REGNUM}, \
 {ARG_POINTER_REGNUM, FRAME_POINTER_REGNUM}, \
 {FRAME_POINTER_REGNUM, STACK_POINTER_REGNUM}}
</pre>

<p>Note that the elimination of the argument pointer with the stack pointer is
specified first since that is the preferred elimination.

<br><dt><code>CAN_ELIMINATE (<var>from-reg</var>, <var>to-reg</var>)</code>
<dd>A C expression that returns non-zero if the compiler is allowed to try
to replace register number <var>from-reg</var> with register number
<var>to-reg</var>.  This macro need only be defined if <code>ELIMINABLE_REGS</code>
is defined, and will usually be the constant 1, since most of the cases
preventing register elimination are things that the compiler already
knows about.

<br><dt><code>INITIAL_ELIMINATION_OFFSET (<var>from-reg</var>, <var>to-reg</var>, <var>offset-var</var>)</code>
<dd>This macro is similar to <code>INITIAL_FRAME_POINTER_OFFSET</code>.  It
specifies the initial difference between the specified pair of
registers.  This macro must be defined if <code>ELIMINABLE_REGS</code> is
defined.

<br><dt><code>LONGJMP_RESTORE_FROM_STACK</code>
<dd>Define this macro if the <code>longjmp</code> function restores registers from
the stack frames, rather than from those saved specifically by
<code>setjmp</code>.  Certain quantities must not be kept in registers across
a call to <code>setjmp</code> on such machines.

<h3>Passing Function Arguments on the Stack</h3>

<p>The macros in this section control how arguments are passed
on the stack.  See the following section for other macros that
control passing certain arguments in registers.

<dl>
<dt><code>PROMOTE_PROTOTYPES</code>
<dd>Define this macro if an argument declared in a prototype as an
integral type smaller than <code>int</code> should actually be passed as an
<code>int</code>.  In addition to avoiding errors in certain cases of
mismatch, it also makes for better code on certain machines.

<br><dt><code>PUSH_ROUNDING (<var>npushed</var>)</code>
<dd>A C expression that is the number of bytes actually pushed onto the
stack when an instruction attempts to push <var>npushed</var> bytes.

<p>If the target machine does not have a push instruction, do not define
this macro.  That directs GNU CC to use an alternate strategy: to
allocate the entire argument block and then store the arguments into
it.

<p>On some machines, the definition

<pre>#define PUSH_ROUNDING(BYTES) (BYTES)
</pre>

<p>will suffice.  But on other machines, instructions that appear
to push one byte actually push two bytes in an attempt to maintain
alignment.  Then the definition should be

<pre>#define PUSH_ROUNDING(BYTES) (((BYTES) + 1) &amp; ~1)
</pre>

<br><dt><code>ACCUMULATE_OUTGOING_ARGS</code>
<dd>If defined, the maximum amount of space required for outgoing arguments
will be computed and placed into the variable
<code>current_function_outgoing_args_size</code>.  No space will be pushed
onto the stack for each call; instead, the function prologue should
increase the stack frame size by this amount.

<p>Defining both <code>PUSH_ROUNDING</code> and <code>ACCUMULATE_OUTGOING_ARGS</code>
is not proper.

<br><dt><code>REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE (<var>fndecl</var>)</code>
<dd>Define this macro if functions should assume that stack space has been
allocated for arguments even when their values are passed in
registers.

<p>The value of this macro is the size, in bytes, of the area reserved for
arguments passed in registers for the function represented by <var>fndecl</var>,
which can be zero if GNU CC is calling a library function.

<p>This space can be allocated by the caller, or be a part of the
machine-dependent stack frame: <code>OUTGOING_REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE</code> says
which.

<br><dt><code>MAYBE_REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE</code>
<dt><code>FINAL_REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE (<var>const_size</var>, <var>var_size</var>)</code>
<dd>Define these macros in addition to the one above if functions might
allocate stack space for arguments even when their values are passed
in registers.  These should be used when the stack space allocated
for arguments in registers is not a simple constant independent of the
function declaration.

<p>The value of the first macro is the size, in bytes, of the area that
we should initially assume would be reserved for arguments passed in registers.

<p>The value of the second macro is the actual size, in bytes, of the area
that will be reserved for arguments passed in registers.  This takes two
arguments: an integer representing the number of bytes of fixed sized
arguments on the stack, and a tree representing the number of bytes of
variable sized arguments on the stack.

<p>When these macros are defined, <code>REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE</code> will only be
called for libcall functions, the current function, or for a function
being called when it is known that such stack space must be allocated. 
In each case this value can be easily computed.

<p>When deciding whether a called function needs such stack space, and how
much space to reserve, GNU CC uses these two macros instead of
<code>REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE</code>.

<br><dt><code>OUTGOING_REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE</code>
<dd>Define this if it is the responsibility of the caller to allocate the area
reserved for arguments passed in registers.

<p>If <code>ACCUMULATE_OUTGOING_ARGS</code> is defined, this macro controls
whether the space for these arguments counts in the value of
<code>current_function_outgoing_args_size</code>.

<br><dt><code>STACK_PARMS_IN_REG_PARM_AREA</code>
<dd>Define this macro if <code>REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE</code> is defined, but the
stack parameters don't skip the area specified by it.

<p>Normally, when a parameter is not passed in registers, it is placed on the
stack beyond the <code>REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE</code> area.  Defining this macro
suppresses this behavior and causes the parameter to be passed on the
stack in its natural location.

<br><dt><code>RETURN_POPS_ARGS (<var>fundecl</var>, <var>funtype</var>, <var>stack-size</var>)</code>
<dd>A C expression that should indicate the number of bytes of its own
arguments that a function pops on returning, or 0 if the
function pops no arguments and the caller must therefore pop them all
after the function returns.

<p><var>fundecl</var> is a C variable whose value is a tree node that describes
the function in question.  Normally it is a node of type
<code>FUNCTION_DECL</code> that describes the declaration of the function. 
From this you can obtain the DECL_MACHINE_ATTRIBUTES of the function.

<p><var>funtype</var> is a C variable whose value is a tree node that
describes the function in question.  Normally it is a node of type
<code>FUNCTION_TYPE</code> that describes the data type of the function. 
From this it is possible to obtain the data types of the value and
arguments (if known).

<p>When a call to a library function is being considered, <var>fundecl</var>
will contain an identifier node for the library function.  Thus, if
you need to distinguish among various library functions, you can do so
by their names.  Note that "library function" in this context means
a function used to perform arithmetic, whose name is known specially
in the compiler and was not mentioned in the C code being compiled.

<p><var>stack-size</var> is the number of bytes of arguments passed on the
stack.  If a variable number of bytes is passed, it is zero, and
argument popping will always be the responsibility of the calling function.

<p>On the Vax, all functions always pop their arguments, so the definition
of this macro is <var>stack-size</var>.  On the 68000, using the standard
calling convention, no functions pop their arguments, so the value of
the macro is always 0 in this case.  But an alternative calling
convention is available in which functions that take a fixed number of
arguments pop them but other functions (such as <code>printf</code>) pop
nothing (the caller pops all).  When this convention is in use,
<var>funtype</var> is examined to determine whether a function takes a fixed
number of arguments.

<h3>Passing Arguments in Registers</h3>

<p>This section describes the macros which let you control how various
types of arguments are passed in registers or how they are arranged in
the stack.

<dl>
<dt><code>FUNCTION_ARG (<var>cum</var>, <var>mode</var>, <var>type</var>, <var>named</var>)</code>
<dd>A C expression that controls whether a function argument is passed
in a register, and which register.

<p>The arguments are <var>cum</var>, which summarizes all the previous
arguments; <var>mode</var>, the machine mode of the argument; <var>type</var>,
the data type of the argument as a tree node or 0 if that is not known
(which happens for C support library functions); and <var>named</var>,
which is 1 for an ordinary argument and 0 for nameless arguments that
correspond to <code><small>...</small></code> in the called function's prototype.

<p>The value of the expression is usually either a <code>reg</code> RTX for the
hard register in which to pass the argument, or zero to pass the
argument on the stack.

<p>For machines like the Vax and 68000, where normally all arguments are
pushed, zero suffices as a definition.

<p>The value of the expression can also be a <code>parallel</code> RTX.  This is
used when an argument is passed in multiple locations.  The mode of the
of the <code>parallel</code> should be the mode of the entire argument.  The
<code>parallel</code> holds any number of <code>expr_list</code> pairs; each one
describes where part of the argument is passed.  In each
<code>expr_list</code> the first operand must be a <code>reg</code> RTX for the hard
register in which to pass this part of the argument, and the mode of the
register RTX indicates how large this part of the argument is.  The
second operand of the <code>expr_list</code> is a <code>const_int</code> which gives
the offset in bytes into the entire argument of where this part starts. 
As a special exception the first <code>expr_list</code> in the <code>parallel</code>
RTX may have a first operand of zero.  This indicates that the bytes
starting from the second operand of that <code>expr_list</code> are stored on
the stack and not held in a register.

<p>The usual way to make the ANSI library <code>stdarg.h</code> work on a machine
where some arguments are usually passed in registers, is to cause
nameless arguments to be passed on the stack instead.  This is done
by making <code>FUNCTION_ARG</code> return 0 whenever <var>named</var> is 0.

<p>You may use the macro <code>MUST_PASS_IN_STACK (<var>mode</var>, <var>type</var>)</code>
in the definition of this macro to determine if this argument is of a
type that must be passed in the stack.  If <code>REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE</code>
is not defined and <code>FUNCTION_ARG</code> returns non-zero for such an
argument, the compiler will abort.  If <code>REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE</code> is
defined, the argument will be computed in the stack and then loaded into
a register.

<br><dt><code>MUST_PASS_IN_STACK (<var>mode</var>, <var>type</var>)</code>
<dd>Define as a C expression that evaluates to nonzero if we do not know how
to pass TYPE solely in registers.  The file <code>expr.h</code> defines a
definition that is usually appropriate, refer to <code>expr.h</code> for additional
documentation.

<br><dt><code>FUNCTION_INCOMING_ARG (<var>cum</var>, <var>mode</var>, <var>type</var>, <var>named</var>)</code>
<dd>Define this macro if the target machine has "register windows", so
that the register in which a function sees an arguments is not
necessarily the same as the one in which the caller passed the
argument.

<p>For such machines, <code>FUNCTION_ARG</code> computes the register in which
the caller passes the value, and <code>FUNCTION_INCOMING_ARG</code> should
be defined in a similar fashion to tell the function being called
where the arguments will arrive.

<p>If <code>FUNCTION_INCOMING_ARG</code> is not defined, <code>FUNCTION_ARG</code>
serves both purposes.

<br><dt><code>FUNCTION_ARG_PARTIAL_NREGS (<var>cum</var>, <var>mode</var>, <var>type</var>, <var>named</var>)</code>
<dd>A C expression for the number of words, at the beginning of an
argument, must be put in registers.  The value must be zero for
arguments that are passed entirely in registers or that are entirely
pushed on the stack.

<p>On some machines, certain arguments must be passed partially in
registers and partially in memory.  On these machines, typically the
first <var>n</var> words of arguments are passed in registers, and the rest
on the stack.  If a multi-word argument (a <code>double</code> or a
structure) crosses that boundary, its first few words must be passed
in registers and the rest must be pushed.  This macro tells the
compiler when this occurs, and how many of the words should go in
registers.

<p><code>FUNCTION_ARG</code> for these arguments should return the first
register to be used by the caller for this argument; likewise
<code>FUNCTION_INCOMING_ARG</code>, for the called function.

<br><dt><code>FUNCTION_ARG_PASS_BY_REFERENCE (<var>cum</var>, <var>mode</var>, <var>type</var>, <var>named</var>)</code>
<dd>A C expression that indicates when an argument must be passed by reference. 
If nonzero for an argument, a copy of that argument is made in memory and a
pointer to the argument is passed instead of the argument itself. 
The pointer is passed in whatever way is appropriate for passing a pointer
to that type.

<p>On machines where <code>REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE</code> is not defined, a suitable
definition of this macro might be
<pre>#define FUNCTION_ARG_PASS_BY_REFERENCE\
(CUM, MODE, TYPE, NAMED)  \
  MUST_PASS_IN_STACK (MODE, TYPE)
</pre>

<br><dt><code>FUNCTION_ARG_CALLEE_COPIES (<var>cum</var>, <var>mode</var>, <var>type</var>, <var>named</var>)</code>
<dd>If defined, a C expression that indicates when it is the called function's
responsibility to make a copy of arguments passed by invisible reference. 
Normally, the caller makes a copy and passes the address of the copy to the
routine being called.  When FUNCTION_ARG_CALLEE_COPIES is defined and is
nonzero, the caller does not make a copy.  Instead, it passes a pointer to the
"live" value.  The called function must not modify this value.  If it can be
determined that the value won't be modified, it need not make a copy;
otherwise a copy must be made.

<br><dt><code>CUMULATIVE_ARGS</code>
<dd>A C type for declaring a variable that is used as the first argument of
<code>FUNCTION_ARG</code> and other related values.  For some target machines,
the type <code>int</code> suffices and can hold the number of bytes of
argument so far.

<p>There is no need to record in <code>CUMULATIVE_ARGS</code> anything about the
arguments that have been passed on the stack.  The compiler has other
variables to keep track of that.  For target machines on which all
arguments are passed on the stack, there is no need to store anything in
<code>CUMULATIVE_ARGS</code>; however, the data structure must exist and
should not be empty, so use <code>int</code>.

<br><dt><code>INIT_CUMULATIVE_ARGS (<var>cum</var>, <var>fntype</var>, <var>libname</var>, <var>indirect</var>)</code>
<dd>A C statement (sans semicolon) for initializing the variable <var>cum</var>
for the state at the beginning of the argument list.  The variable has
type <code>CUMULATIVE_ARGS</code>.  The value of <var>fntype</var> is the tree node
for the data type of the function which will receive the args, or 0
if the args are to a compiler support library function.  The value of
<var>indirect</var> is nonzero when processing an indirect call, for example
a call through a function pointer.  The value of <var>indirect</var> is zero
for a call to an explicitly named function, a library function call, or when
<code>INIT_CUMULATIVE_ARGS</code> is used to find arguments for the function
being compiled.

<p>When processing a call to a compiler support library function,
<var>libname</var> identifies which one.  It is a <code>symbol_ref</code> rtx which
contains the name of the function, as a string.  <var>libname</var> is 0 when
an ordinary C function call is being processed.  Thus, each time this
macro is called, either <var>libname</var> or <var>fntype</var> is nonzero, but
never both of them at once.

<br><dt><code>INIT_CUMULATIVE_INCOMING_ARGS (<var>cum</var>, <var>fntype</var>, <var>libname</var>)</code>
<dd>Like <code>INIT_CUMULATIVE_ARGS</code> but overrides it for the purposes of
finding the arguments for the function being compiled.  If this macro is
undefined, <code>INIT_CUMULATIVE_ARGS</code> is used instead.

<p>The value passed for <var>libname</var> is always 0, since library routines
with special calling conventions are never compiled with GNU CC.  The
argument <var>libname</var> exists for symmetry with
<code>INIT_CUMULATIVE_ARGS</code>.

<br><dt><code>FUNCTION_ARG_ADVANCE (<var>cum</var>, <var>mode</var>, <var>type</var>, <var>named</var>)</code>
<dd>A C statement (sans semicolon) to update the summarizer variable
<var>cum</var> to advance past an argument in the argument list.  The
values <var>mode</var>, <var>type</var> and <var>named</var> describe that argument. 
Once this is done, the variable <var>cum</var> is suitable for analyzing
the <em>following</em> argument with <code>FUNCTION_ARG</code>, etc.

<p>This macro need not do anything if the argument in question was passed
on the stack.  The compiler knows how to track the amount of stack space
used for arguments without any special help.

<br><dt><code>FUNCTION_ARG_PADDING (<var>mode</var>, <var>type</var>)</code>
<dd>If defined, a C expression which determines whether, and in which direction,
to pad out an argument with extra space.  The value should be of type
<code>enum direction</code>: either <code>upward</code> to pad above the argument,
<code>downward</code> to pad below, or <code>none</code> to inhibit padding.

<p>The <em>amount</em> of padding is always just enough to reach the next
multiple of <code>FUNCTION_ARG_BOUNDARY</code>; this macro does not control
it.

<p>This macro has a default definition which is right for most systems. 
For little-endian machines, the default is to pad upward.  For
big-endian machines, the default is to pad downward for an argument of
constant size shorter than an <code>int</code>, and upward otherwise.

<br><dt><code>FUNCTION_ARG_BOUNDARY (<var>mode</var>, <var>type</var>)</code>
<dd>If defined, a C expression that gives the alignment boundary, in bits,
of an argument with the specified mode and type.  If it is not defined,
<code>PARM_BOUNDARY</code> is used for all arguments.

<br><dt><code>FUNCTION_ARG_REGNO_P (<var>regno</var>)</code>
<dd>A C expression that is nonzero if <var>regno</var> is the number of a hard
register in which function arguments are sometimes passed.  This does
<em>not</em> include implicit arguments such as the static chain and
the structure-value address.  On many machines, no registers can be
used for this purpose since all function arguments are pushed on the
stack.

<br><dt><code>LOAD_ARGS_REVERSED</code>
<dd>If defined, the order in which arguments are loaded into their
respective argument registers is reversed so that the last
argument is loaded first.  This macro only effects arguments
passed in registers.

<h3>How Scalar Function Values Are Returned</h3>

<p>This section discusses the macros that control returning scalars as
values--values that can fit in registers.

<dl>
<dt><code>TRADITIONAL_RETURN_FLOAT</code>
<dd>Define this macro if <code>-traditional</code> should not cause functions
declared to return <code>float</code> to convert the value to <code>double</code>.

<br><dt><code>FUNCTION_VALUE (<var>valtype</var>, <var>func</var>)</code>
<dd>A C expression to create an RTX representing the place where a
function returns a value of data type <var>valtype</var>.  <var>valtype</var> is
a tree node representing a data type.  Write <code>TYPE_MODE
(<var>valtype</var>)</code> to get the machine mode used to represent that type. 
On many machines, only the mode is relevant.  (Actually, on most
machines, scalar values are returned in the same place regardless of
mode).

<p>The value of the expression is usually a <code>reg</code> RTX for the hard
register where the return value is stored.  The value can also be a
<code>parallel</code> RTX, if the return value is in multiple places.  See
<code>FUNCTION_ARG</code> for an explanation of the <code>parallel</code> form.

<p>If <code>PROMOTE_FUNCTION_RETURN</code> is defined, you must apply the same
promotion rules specified in <code>PROMOTE_MODE</code> if <var>valtype</var> is a
scalar type.

<p>If the precise function being called is known, <var>func</var> is a tree
node (<code>FUNCTION_DECL</code>) for it; otherwise, <var>func</var> is a null
pointer.  This makes it possible to use a different value-returning
convention for specific functions when all their calls are
known.

<p><code>FUNCTION_VALUE</code> is not used for return vales with aggregate data
types, because these are returned in another way.  See
<code>STRUCT_VALUE_REGNUM</code> and related macros, below.

<br><dt><code>FUNCTION_OUTGOING_VALUE (<var>valtype</var>, <var>func</var>)</code>
<dd>Define this macro if the target machine has "register windows"
so that the register in which a function returns its value is not
the same as the one in which the caller sees the value.

<p>For such machines, <code>FUNCTION_VALUE</code> computes the register in which
the caller will see the value.  <code>FUNCTION_OUTGOING_VALUE</code> should be
defined in a similar fashion to tell the function where to put the
value.

<p>If <code>FUNCTION_OUTGOING_VALUE</code> is not defined,
<code>FUNCTION_VALUE</code> serves both purposes.

<p><code>FUNCTION_OUTGOING_VALUE</code> is not used for return vales with
aggregate data types, because these are returned in another way.  See
<code>STRUCT_VALUE_REGNUM</code> and related macros, below.

<br><dt><code>LIBCALL_VALUE (<var>mode</var>)</code>
<dd>A C expression to create an RTX representing the place where a library
function returns a value of mode <var>mode</var>.  If the precise function
being called is known, <var>func</var> is a tree node
(<code>FUNCTION_DECL</code>) for it; otherwise, <var>func</var> is a null
pointer.  This makes it possible to use a different value-returning
convention for specific functions when all their calls are
known.

<p>Note that "library function" in this context means a compiler
support routine, used to perform arithmetic, whose name is known
specially by the compiler and was not mentioned in the C code being
compiled.

<p>The definition of <code>LIBRARY_VALUE</code> need not be concerned aggregate
data types, because none of the library functions returns such types.

<br><dt><code>FUNCTION_VALUE_REGNO_P (<var>regno</var>)</code>
<dd>A C expression that is nonzero if <var>regno</var> is the number of a hard
register in which the values of called function may come back.

<p>A register whose use for returning values is limited to serving as the
second of a pair (for a value of type <code>double</code>, say) need not be
recognized by this macro.  So for most machines, this definition
suffices:

<pre>#define FUNCTION_VALUE_REGNO_P(N) ((N) == 0)
</pre>

<p>If the machine has register windows, so that the caller and the called
function use different registers for the return value, this macro
should recognize only the caller's register numbers.

<br><dt><code>APPLY_RESULT_SIZE</code>
<dd>Define this macro if <code>untyped_call</code> and <code>untyped_return</code>
need more space than is implied by <code>FUNCTION_VALUE_REGNO_P</code> for
saving and restoring an arbitrary return value.

<h3>How Large Values Are Returned</h3>

<p>When a function value's mode is <code>BLKmode</code> (and in some other
cases), the value is not returned according to <code>FUNCTION_VALUE</code>
(see <a href="#Scalar%20Return">Scalar Return</a>).  Instead, the caller passes the address of a
block of memory in which the value should be stored.  This address
is called the <dfn>structure value address</dfn>.

<p>This section describes how to control returning structure values in
memory.

<dl>
<dt><code>RETURN_IN_MEMORY (<var>type</var>)</code>
<dd>A C expression which can inhibit the returning of certain function
values in registers, based on the type of value.  A nonzero value says
to return the function value in memory, just as large structures are
always returned.  Here <var>type</var> will be a C expression of type
<code>tree</code>, representing the data type of the value.

<p>Note that values of mode <code>BLKmode</code> must be explicitly handled
by this macro.  Also, the option <code>-fpcc-struct-return</code>
takes effect regardless of this macro.  On most systems, it is
possible to leave the macro undefined; this causes a default
definition to be used, whose value is the constant 1 for <code>BLKmode</code>
values, and 0 otherwise.

<p>Do not use this macro to indicate that structures and unions should always
be returned in memory.  You should instead use <code>DEFAULT_PCC_STRUCT_RETURN</code>
to indicate this.

<br><dt><code>DEFAULT_PCC_STRUCT_RETURN</code>
<dd>Define this macro to be 1 if all structure and union return values must be
in memory.  Since this results in slower code, this should be defined
only if needed for compatibility with other compilers or with an ABI. 
If you define this macro to be 0, then the conventions used for structure
and union return values are decided by the <code>RETURN_IN_MEMORY</code> macro.

<p>If not defined, this defaults to the value 1.

<br><dt><code>STRUCT_VALUE_REGNUM</code>
<dd>If the structure value address is passed in a register, then
<code>STRUCT_VALUE_REGNUM</code> should be the number of that register.

<br><dt><code>STRUCT_VALUE</code>
<dd>If the structure value address is not passed in a register, define
<code>STRUCT_VALUE</code> as an expression returning an RTX for the place
where the address is passed.  If it returns 0, the address is passed as
an "invisible" first argument.

<br><dt><code>STRUCT_VALUE_INCOMING_REGNUM</code>
<dd>On some architectures the place where the structure value address
is found by the called function is not the same place that the
caller put it.  This can be due to register windows, or it could
be because the function prologue moves it to a different place.

<p>If the incoming location of the structure value address is in a
register, define this macro as the register number.

<br><dt><code>STRUCT_VALUE_INCOMING</code>
<dd>If the incoming location is not a register, then you should define
<code>STRUCT_VALUE_INCOMING</code> as an expression for an RTX for where the
called function should find the value.  If it should find the value on
the stack, define this to create a <code>mem</code> which refers to the frame
pointer.  A definition of 0 means that the address is passed as an
"invisible" first argument.

<br><dt><code>PCC_STATIC_STRUCT_RETURN</code>
<dd>Define this macro if the usual system convention on the target machine
for returning structures and unions is for the called function to return
the address of a static variable containing the value.

<p>Do not define this if the usual system convention is for the caller to
pass an address to the subroutine.

<p>This macro has effect in <code>-fpcc-struct-return</code> mode, but it does
nothing when you use <code>-freg-struct-return</code> mode.

<h3>Caller-Saves Register Allocation</h3>

<p>If you enable it, GNU CC can save registers around function calls.  This
makes it possible to use call-clobbered registers to hold variables that
must live across calls.

<dl>
<dt><code>DEFAULT_CALLER_SAVES</code>
<dd>Define this macro if function calls on the target machine do not preserve
any registers; in other words, if <code>CALL_USED_REGISTERS</code> has 1
for all registers.  When defined, this macro enables <code>-fcaller-saves</code>
by default for all optimization levels.  It has no effect for optimization
levels 2 and higher, where <code>-fcaller-saves</code> is the default.

<br><dt><code>CALLER_SAVE_PROFITABLE (<var>refs</var>, <var>calls</var>)</code>
<dd>A C expression to determine whether it is worthwhile to consider placing
a pseudo-register in a call-clobbered hard register and saving and
restoring it around each function call.  The expression should be 1 when
this is worth doing, and 0 otherwise.

<p>If you don't define this macro, a default is used which is good on most
machines: <code>4 * <var>calls</var> &lt; <var>refs</var></code>.

<br><dt><code>HARD_REGNO_CALLER_SAVE_MODE (<var>regno</var>, <var>nregs</var>)</code>
<dd>A C expression specifying which mode is required for saving <var>nregs</var>
of a pseudo-register in call-clobbered hard register <var>regno</var>.  If
<var>regno</var> is unsuitable for caller save, <code>VOIDmode</code> should be
returned.  For most machines this macro need not be defined since GCC
will select the smallest suitable mode.

<h3>Function Entry and Exit</h3>

<p>This section describes the macros that output function entry
(<dfn>prologue</dfn>) and exit (<dfn>epilogue</dfn>) code.

<dl>
<dt><code>FUNCTION_PROLOGUE (<var>file</var>, <var>size</var>)</code>
<dd>A C compound statement that outputs the assembler code for entry to a
function.  The prologue is responsible for setting up the stack frame,
initializing the frame pointer register, saving registers that must be
saved, and allocating <var>size</var> additional bytes of storage for the
local variables.  <var>size</var> is an integer.  <var>file</var> is a stdio
stream to which the assembler code should be output.

<p>The label for the beginning of the function need not be output by this
macro.  That has already been done when the macro is run.

<p>To determine which registers to save, the macro can refer to the array
<code>regs_ever_live</code>: element <var>r</var> is nonzero if hard register
<var>r</var> is used anywhere within the function.  This implies the function
prologue should save register <var>r</var>, provided it is not one of the
call-used registers.  (<code>FUNCTION_EPILOGUE</code> must likewise use
<code>regs_ever_live</code>.)

<p>On machines that have "register windows", the function entry code does
not save on the stack the registers that are in the windows, even if
they are supposed to be preserved by function calls; instead it takes
appropriate steps to "push" the register stack, if any non-call-used
registers are used in the function.

<p>On machines where functions may or may not have frame-pointers, the
function entry code must vary accordingly; it must set up the frame
pointer if one is wanted, and not otherwise.  To determine whether a
frame pointer is in wanted, the macro can refer to the variable
<code>frame_pointer_needed</code>.  The variable's value will be 1 at run
time in a function that needs a frame pointer.  See <a href="#Elimination">Elimination</a>.

<p>The function entry code is responsible for allocating any stack space
required for the function.  This stack space consists of the regions
listed below.  In most cases, these regions are allocated in the
order listed, with the last listed region closest to the top of the
stack (the lowest address if <code>STACK_GROWS_DOWNWARD</code> is defined, and
the highest address if it is not defined).  You can use a different order
for a machine if doing so is more convenient or required for
compatibility reasons.  Except in cases where required by standard
or by a debugger, there is no reason why the stack layout used by GCC
need agree with that used by other compilers for a machine.

<ul>
<li>A region of <code>current_function_pretend_args_size</code> bytes of
uninitialized space just underneath the first argument arriving on the
stack.  (This may not be at the very start of the allocated stack region
if the calling sequence has pushed anything else since pushing the stack
arguments.  But usually, on such machines, nothing else has been pushed
yet, because the function prologue itself does all the pushing.)  This
region is used on machines where an argument may be passed partly in
registers and partly in memory, and, in some cases to support the
features in <code>varargs.h</code> and <code>stdargs.h</code>.

<li>An area of memory used to save certain registers used by the function. 
The size of this area, which may also include space for such things as
the return address and pointers to previous stack frames, is
machine-specific and usually depends on which registers have been used
in the function.  Machines with register windows often do not require
a save area.

<li>A region of at least <var>size</var> bytes, possibly rounded up to an allocation
boundary, to contain the local variables of the function.  On some machines,
this region and the save area may occur in the opposite order, with the
save area closer to the top of the stack.

<li>Optionally, when <code>ACCUMULATE_OUTGOING_ARGS</code> is defined, a region of
<code>current_function_outgoing_args_size</code> bytes to be used for outgoing
argument lists of the function.  See <a href="#Stack%20Arguments">Stack Arguments</a>. 
</ul>

<p>Normally, it is necessary for the macros <code>FUNCTION_PROLOGUE</code> and
<code>FUNCTION_EPILOGUE</code> to treat leaf functions specially.  The C
variable <code>current_function_is_leaf</code> is nonzero for such a function.

<br><dt><code>EXIT_IGNORE_STACK</code>
<dd>Define this macro as a C expression that is nonzero if the return
instruction or the function epilogue ignores the value of the stack
pointer; in other words, if it is safe to delete an instruction to
adjust the stack pointer before a return from the function.

<p>Note that this macro's value is relevant only for functions for which
frame pointers are maintained.  It is never safe to delete a final
stack adjustment in a function that has no frame pointer, and the
compiler knows this regardless of <code>EXIT_IGNORE_STACK</code>.

<br><dt><code>EPILOGUE_USES (<var>regno</var>)</code>
<dd>Define this macro as a C expression that is nonzero for registers are
used by the epilogue or the <code>return</code> pattern.  The stack and frame
pointer registers are already be assumed to be used as needed.

<br><dt><code>FUNCTION_EPILOGUE (<var>file</var>, <var>size</var>)</code>
<dd>A C compound statement that outputs the assembler code for exit from a
function.  The epilogue is responsible for restoring the saved
registers and stack pointer to their values when the function was
called, and returning control to the caller.  This macro takes the
same arguments as the macro <code>FUNCTION_PROLOGUE</code>, and the
registers to restore are determined from <code>regs_ever_live</code> and
<code>CALL_USED_REGISTERS</code> in the same way.

<p>On some machines, there is a single instruction that does all the work
of returning from the function.  On these machines, give that
instruction the name <code>return</code> and do not define the macro
<code>FUNCTION_EPILOGUE</code> at all.

<p>Do not define a pattern named <code>return</code> if you want the
<code>FUNCTION_EPILOGUE</code> to be used.  If you want the target switches
to control whether return instructions or epilogues are used, define a
<code>return</code> pattern with a validity condition that tests the target
switches appropriately.  If the <code>return</code> pattern's validity
condition is false, epilogues will be used.

<p>On machines where functions may or may not have frame-pointers, the
function exit code must vary accordingly.  Sometimes the code for these
two cases is completely different.  To determine whether a frame pointer
is wanted, the macro can refer to the variable
<code>frame_pointer_needed</code>.  The variable's value will be 1 when compiling
a function that needs a frame pointer.

<p>Normally, <code>FUNCTION_PROLOGUE</code> and <code>FUNCTION_EPILOGUE</code> must
treat leaf functions specially.  The C variable <code>current_function_is_leaf</code>
is nonzero for such a function.  See <a href="#Leaf%20Functions">Leaf Functions</a>.

<p>On some machines, some functions pop their arguments on exit while
others leave that for the caller to do.  For example, the 68020 when
given <code>-mrtd</code> pops arguments in functions that take a fixed
number of arguments.

<p>Your definition of the macro <code>RETURN_POPS_ARGS</code> decides which
functions pop their own arguments.  <code>FUNCTION_EPILOGUE</code> needs to
know what was decided.  The variable that is called
<code>current_function_pops_args</code> is the number of bytes of its
arguments that a function should pop.  See <a href="#Scalar%20Return">Scalar Return</a>.

<br><dt><code>DELAY_SLOTS_FOR_EPILOGUE</code>
<dd>Define this macro if the function epilogue contains delay slots to which
instructions from the rest of the function can be "moved".  The
definition should be a C expression whose value is an integer
representing the number of delay slots there.

<br><dt><code>ELIGIBLE_FOR_EPILOGUE_DELAY (<var>insn</var>, <var>n</var>)</code>
<dd>A C expression that returns 1 if <var>insn</var> can be placed in delay
slot number <var>n</var> of the epilogue.

<p>The argument <var>n</var> is an integer which identifies the delay slot now
being considered (since different slots may have different rules of
eligibility).  It is never negative and is always less than the number
of epilogue delay slots (what <code>DELAY_SLOTS_FOR_EPILOGUE</code> returns). 
If you reject a particular insn for a given delay slot, in principle, it
may be reconsidered for a subsequent delay slot.  Also, other insns may
(at least in principle) be considered for the so far unfilled delay
slot.

<p>The insns accepted to fill the epilogue delay slots are put in an RTL
list made with <code>insn_list</code> objects, stored in the variable
<code>current_function_epilogue_delay_list</code>.  The insn for the first
delay slot comes first in the list.  Your definition of the macro
<code>FUNCTION_EPILOGUE</code> should fill the delay slots by outputting the
insns in this list, usually by calling <code>final_scan_insn</code>.

<p>You need not define this macro if you did not define
<code>DELAY_SLOTS_FOR_EPILOGUE</code>.

<br><dt><code>ASM_OUTPUT_MI_THUNK (<var>file</var>, <var>thunk_fndecl</var>, <var>delta</var>, <var>function</var>)</code>
<dd>A C compound statement that outputs the assembler code for a thunk
function, used to implement C++ virtual function calls with multiple
inheritance.  The thunk acts as a wrapper around a virtual function,
adjusting the implicit object parameter before handing control off to
the real function.

<p>First, emit code to add the integer <var>delta</var> to the location that
contains the incoming first argument.  Assume that this argument
contains a pointer, and is the one used to pass the <code>this</code> pointer
in C++.  This is the incoming argument <em>before</em> the function prologue,
e.g. <code>%o0</code> on a sparc.  The addition must preserve the values of
all other incoming arguments.

<p>After the addition, emit code to jump to <var>function</var>, which is a
<code>FUNCTION_DECL</code>.  This is a direct pure jump, not a call, and does
not touch the return address.  Hence returning from <var>FUNCTION</var> will
return to whoever called the current <code>thunk</code>.

<p>The effect must be as if <var>function</var> had been called directly with
the adjusted first argument.  This macro is responsible for emitting all
of the code for a thunk function; <code>FUNCTION_PROLOGUE</code> and
<code>FUNCTION_EPILOGUE</code> are not invoked.

<p>The <var>thunk_fndecl</var> is redundant.  (<var>delta</var> and <var>function</var>
have already been extracted from it.)  It might possibly be useful on
some targets, but probably not.

<p>If you do not define this macro, the target-independent code in the C++
frontend will generate a less efficient heavyweight thunk that calls
<var>function</var> instead of jumping to it.  The generic approach does
not support varargs.

<h3>Generating Code for Profiling</h3>

<p>These macros will help you generate code for profiling.

<dl>
<dt><code>FUNCTION_PROFILER (<var>file</var>, <var>labelno</var>)</code>
<dd>A C statement or compound statement to output to <var>file</var> some
assembler code to call the profiling subroutine <code>mcount</code>. 
Before calling, the assembler code must load the address of a
counter variable into a register where <code>mcount</code> expects to
find the address.  The name of this variable is <code>LP</code> followed
by the number <var>labelno</var>, so you would generate the name using
<code>LP%d</code> in a <code>fprintf</code>.

<p>The details of how the address should be passed to <code>mcount</code> are
determined by your operating system environment, not by GNU CC.  To
figure them out, compile a small program for profiling using the
system's installed C compiler and look at the assembler code that
results.

<br><dt><code>PROFILE_BEFORE_PROLOGUE</code>
<dd>Define this macro if the code for function profiling should come before
the function prologue.  Normally, the profiling code comes after.

<br><dt><code>FUNCTION_BLOCK_PROFILER (<var>file</var>, <var>labelno</var>)</code>
<dd>A C statement or compound statement to output to <var>file</var> some
assembler code to initialize basic-block profiling for the current
object module.  The global compile flag <code>profile_block_flag</code>
distinguishes two profile modes.

<dl>
<dt><code>profile_block_flag != 2</code>
<dd>Output code to call the subroutine <code>__bb_init_func</code> once per
object module, passing it as its sole argument the address of a block
allocated in the object module.

<p>The name of the block is a local symbol made with this statement:

<pre>ASM_GENERATE_INTERNAL_LABEL (<var>buffer</var>, "LPBX", 0);
</pre>

<p>Of course, since you are writing the definition of
<code>ASM_GENERATE_INTERNAL_LABEL</code> as well as that of this macro, you
can take a short cut in the definition of this macro and use the name
that you know will result.

<p>The first word of this block is a flag which will be nonzero if the
object module has already been initialized.  So test this word first,
and do not call <code>__bb_init_func</code> if the flag is
nonzero.  BLOCK_OR_LABEL contains a unique number which may be used to
generate a label as a branch destination when <code>__bb_init_func</code>
will not be called.

<p>Described in assembler language, the code to be output looks like:

<pre>  cmp (LPBX0),0
  bne local_label
  parameter1 &lt;- LPBX0
  call __bb_init_func
local_label:
</pre>

<br><dt><code>profile_block_flag == 2</code>
<dd>Output code to call the subroutine <code>__bb_init_trace_func</code>
and pass two parameters to it.  The first parameter is the same as
for <code>__bb_init_func</code>.  The second parameter is the number of the
first basic block of the function as given by BLOCK_OR_LABEL.  Note
that <code>__bb_init_trace_func</code> has to be called, even if the object
module has been initialized already.

<p>Described in assembler language, the code to be output looks like:
<pre>parameter1 &lt;- LPBX0
parameter2 &lt;- BLOCK_OR_LABEL
call __bb_init_trace_func
</pre>
</dl>

<br><dt><code>BLOCK_PROFILER (<var>file</var>, <var>blockno</var>)</code>
<dd>A C statement or compound statement to output to <var>file</var> some
assembler code to increment the count associated with the basic
block number <var>blockno</var>.  The global compile flag
<code>profile_block_flag</code> distinguishes two profile modes.

<dl>
<dt><code>profile_block_flag != 2</code>
<dd>Output code to increment the counter directly.  Basic blocks are
numbered separately from zero within each compilation.  The count
associated with block number <var>blockno</var> is at index
<var>blockno</var> in a vector of words; the name of this array is a local
symbol made with this statement:

<pre>ASM_GENERATE_INTERNAL_LABEL (<var>buffer</var>, "LPBX", 2);
</pre>

<p>Of course, since you are writing the definition of
<code>ASM_GENERATE_INTERNAL_LABEL</code> as well as that of this macro, you
can take a short cut in the definition of this macro and use the name
that you know will result.

<p>Described in assembler language, the code to be output looks like:

<pre>inc (LPBX2+4*BLOCKNO)
</pre>

<br><dt><code>profile_block_flag == 2</code>
<dd>Output code to initialize the global structure <code>__bb</code> and
call the function <code>__bb_trace_func</code>, which will increment the
counter.

<p><code>__bb</code> consists of two words.  In the first word, the current
basic block number, as given by BLOCKNO, has to be stored.  In
the second word, the address of a block allocated in the object
module has to be stored.  The address is given by the label created
with this statement:

<pre>ASM_GENERATE_INTERNAL_LABEL (<var>buffer</var>, "LPBX", 0);
</pre>

<p>Described in assembler language, the code to be output looks like:
<pre>move BLOCKNO -&gt; (__bb)
move LPBX0 -&gt; (__bb+4)
call __bb_trace_func
</pre>
</dl>

<br><dt><code>FUNCTION_BLOCK_PROFILER_EXIT (<var>file</var>)</code>
<dd>A C statement or compound statement to output to <var>file</var>
assembler code to call function <code>__bb_trace_ret</code>.  The
assembler code should only be output
if the global compile flag <code>profile_block_flag</code> == 2.  This
macro has to be used at every place where code for returning from
a function is generated (e.g. <code>FUNCTION_EPILOGUE</code>).  Although
you have to write the definition of <code>FUNCTION_EPILOGUE</code>
as well, you have to define this macro to tell the compiler, that
the proper call to <code>__bb_trace_ret</code> is produced.

<br><dt><code>MACHINE_STATE_SAVE (<var>id</var>)</code>
<dd>A C statement or compound statement to save all registers, which may
be clobbered by a function call, including condition codes.  The
<code>asm</code> statement will be mostly likely needed to handle this
task.  Local labels in the assembler code can be concatenated with the
string <var>id</var>, to obtain a unique lable name.

<p>Registers or condition codes clobbered by <code>FUNCTION_PROLOGUE</code> or
<code>FUNCTION_EPILOGUE</code> must be saved in the macros
<code>FUNCTION_BLOCK_PROFILER</code>, <code>FUNCTION_BLOCK_PROFILER_EXIT</code> and
<code>BLOCK_PROFILER</code> prior calling <code>__bb_init_trace_func</code>,
<code>__bb_trace_ret</code> and <code>__bb_trace_func</code> respectively.

<br><dt><code>MACHINE_STATE_RESTORE (<var>id</var>)</code>
<dd>A C statement or compound statement to restore all registers, including
condition codes, saved by <code>MACHINE_STATE_SAVE</code>.

<p>Registers or condition codes clobbered by <code>FUNCTION_PROLOGUE</code> or
<code>FUNCTION_EPILOGUE</code> must be restored in the macros
<code>FUNCTION_BLOCK_PROFILER</code>, <code>FUNCTION_BLOCK_PROFILER_EXIT</code> and
<code>BLOCK_PROFILER</code> after calling <code>__bb_init_trace_func</code>,
<code>__bb_trace_ret</code> and <code>__bb_trace_func</code> respectively.

<br><dt><code>BLOCK_PROFILER_CODE</code>
<dd>A C function or functions which are needed in the library to
support block profiling.

<h2>Implementing the Varargs Macros</h2>

<p>GNU CC comes with an implementation of <code>varargs.h</code> and
<code>stdarg.h</code> that work without change on machines that pass arguments
on the stack.  Other machines require their own implementations of
varargs, and the two machine independent header files must have
conditionals to include it.

<p>ANSI <code>stdarg.h</code> differs from traditional <code>varargs.h</code> mainly in
the calling convention for <code>va_start</code>.  The traditional
implementation takes just one argument, which is the variable in which
to store the argument pointer.  The ANSI implementation of
<code>va_start</code> takes an additional second argument.  The user is
supposed to write the last named argument of the function here.

<p>However, <code>va_start</code> should not use this argument.  The way to find
the end of the named arguments is with the built-in functions described
below.

<dl>
<dt><code>__builtin_saveregs ()</code>
<dd>Use this built-in function to save the argument registers in memory so
that the varargs mechanism can access them.  Both ANSI and traditional
versions of <code>va_start</code> must use <code>__builtin_saveregs</code>, unless
you use <code>SETUP_INCOMING_VARARGS</code> (see below) instead.

<p>On some machines, <code>__builtin_saveregs</code> is open-coded under the
control of the macro <code>EXPAND_BUILTIN_SAVEREGS</code>.  On other machines,
it calls a routine written in assembler language, found in
<code>libgcc2.c</code>.

<p>Code generated for the call to <code>__builtin_saveregs</code> appears at the
beginning of the function, as opposed to where the call to
<code>__builtin_saveregs</code> is written, regardless of what the code is. 
This is because the registers must be saved before the function starts
to use them for its own purposes.

<br><dt><code>__builtin_args_info (<var>category</var>)</code>
<dd>Use this built-in function to find the first anonymous arguments in
registers.

<p>In general, a machine may have several categories of registers used for
arguments, each for a particular category of data types.  (For example,
on some machines, floating-point registers are used for floating-point
arguments while other arguments are passed in the general registers.) 
To make non-varargs functions use the proper calling convention, you
have defined the <code>CUMULATIVE_ARGS</code> data type to record how many
registers in each category have been used so far

<p><code>__builtin_args_info</code> accesses the same data structure of type
<code>CUMULATIVE_ARGS</code> after the ordinary argument layout is finished
with it, with <var>category</var> specifying which word to access.  Thus, the
value indicates the first unused register in a given category.

<p>Normally, you would use <code>__builtin_args_info</code> in the implementation
of <code>va_start</code>, accessing each category just once and storing the
value in the <code>va_list</code> object.  This is because <code>va_list</code> will
have to update the values, and there is no way to alter the
values accessed by <code>__builtin_args_info</code>.

<br><dt><code>__builtin_next_arg (<var>lastarg</var>)</code>
<dd>This is the equivalent of <code>__builtin_args_info</code>, for stack
arguments.  It returns the address of the first anonymous stack
argument, as type <code>void *</code>. If <code>ARGS_GROW_DOWNWARD</code>, it
returns the address of the location above the first anonymous stack
argument.  Use it in <code>va_start</code> to initialize the pointer for
fetching arguments from the stack.  Also use it in <code>va_start</code> to
verify that the second parameter <var>lastarg</var> is the last named argument
of the current function.

<br><dt><code>__builtin_classify_type (<var>object</var>)</code>
<dd>Since each machine has its own conventions for which data types are
passed in which kind of register, your implementation of <code>va_arg</code>
has to embody these conventions.  The easiest way to categorize the
specified data type is to use <code>__builtin_classify_type</code> together
with <code>sizeof</code> and <code>__alignof__</code>.

<p><code>__builtin_classify_type</code> ignores the value of <var>object</var>,
considering only its data type.  It returns an integer describing what
kind of type that is--integer, floating, pointer, structure, and so on.

<p>The file <code>typeclass.h</code> defines an enumeration that you can use to
interpret the values of <code>__builtin_classify_type</code>. 
</dl>

<p>These machine description macros help implement varargs:

<dl>
<dt><code>EXPAND_BUILTIN_SAVEREGS (<var>args</var>)</code>
<dd>If defined, is a C expression that produces the machine-specific code
for a call to <code>__builtin_saveregs</code>.  This code will be moved to the
very beginning of the function, before any parameter access are made. 
The return value of this function should be an RTX that contains the
value to use as the return of <code>__builtin_saveregs</code>.

<p>The argument <var>args</var> is a <code>tree_list</code> containing the arguments
that were passed to <code>__builtin_saveregs</code>.

<p>If this macro is not defined, the compiler will output an ordinary
call to the library function <code>__builtin_saveregs</code>.

<br><dt><code>SETUP_INCOMING_VARARGS (<var>args_so_far</var>, <var>mode</var>, <var>type</var>, <var>pretend_args_size</var>, <var>second_time</var>)</code>
<dd>This macro offers an alternative to using <code>__builtin_saveregs</code> and
defining the macro <code>EXPAND_BUILTIN_SAVEREGS</code>.  Use it to store the
anonymous register arguments into the stack so that all the arguments
appear to have been passed consecutively on the stack.  Once this is
done, you can use the standard implementation of varargs that works for
machines that pass all their arguments on the stack.

<p>The argument <var>args_so_far</var> is the <code>CUMULATIVE_ARGS</code> data
structure, containing the values that obtain after processing of the
named arguments.  The arguments <var>mode</var> and <var>type</var> describe the
last named argument--its machine mode and its data type as a tree node.

<p>The macro implementation should do two things: first, push onto the
stack all the argument registers <em>not</em> used for the named
arguments, and second, store the size of the data thus pushed into the
<code>int</code>-valued variable whose name is supplied as the argument
<var>pretend_args_size</var>.  The value that you store here will serve as
additional offset for setting up the stack frame.

<p>Because you must generate code to push the anonymous arguments at
compile time without knowing their data types,
<code>SETUP_INCOMING_VARARGS</code> is only useful on machines that have just
a single category of argument register and use it uniformly for all data
types.

<p>If the argument <var>second_time</var> is nonzero, it means that the
arguments of the function are being analyzed for the second time.  This
happens for an inline function, which is not actually compiled until the
end of the source file.  The macro <code>SETUP_INCOMING_VARARGS</code> should
not generate any instructions in this case.

<br><dt><code>STRICT_ARGUMENT_NAMING</code>
<dd>Define this macro to be a nonzero value if the location where a function
argument is passed depends on whether or not it is a named argument.

<p>This macro controls how the <var>named</var> argument to <code>FUNCTION_ARG</code>
is set for varargs and stdarg functions.  If this macro returns a
nonzero value, the <var>named</var> argument is always true for named
arguments, and false for unnamed arguments.  If it returns a value of
zero, but <code>SETUP_INCOMING_VARARGS</code> is defined, then all arguments
are treated as named.  Otherwise, all named arguments except the last
are treated as named.

<p>You need not define this macro if it always returns zero.

<br><dt><code>PRETEND_OUTGOING_VARARGS_NAMED</code>
<dd>If you need to conditionally change ABIs so that one works with
<code>SETUP_INCOMING_VARARGS</code>, but the other works like neither
<code>SETUP_INCOMING_VARARGS</code> nor <code>STRICT_ARGUMENT_NAMING</code> was
defined, then define this macro to return nonzero if
<code>SETUP_INCOMING_VARARGS</code> is used, zero otherwise. 
Otherwise, you should not define this macro.

<h2>Trampolines for Nested Functions</h2>

<p>A <dfn>trampoline</dfn> is a small piece of code that is created at run time
when the address of a nested function is taken.  It normally resides on
the stack, in the stack frame of the containing function.  These macros
tell GNU CC how to generate code to allocate and initialize a
trampoline.

<p>The instructions in the trampoline must do two things: load a constant
address into the static chain register, and jump to the real address of
the nested function.  On CISC machines such as the m68k, this requires
two instructions, a move immediate and a jump.  Then the two addresses
exist in the trampoline as word-long immediate operands.  On RISC
machines, it is often necessary to load each address into a register in
two parts.  Then pieces of each address form separate immediate
operands.

<p>The code generated to initialize the trampoline must store the variable
parts--the static chain value and the function address--into the
immediate operands of the instructions.  On a CISC machine, this is
simply a matter of copying each address to a memory reference at the
proper offset from the start of the trampoline.  On a RISC machine, it
may be necessary to take out pieces of the address and store them
separately.

<dl>
<dt><code>TRAMPOLINE_TEMPLATE (<var>file</var>)</code>
<dd>A C statement to output, on the stream <var>file</var>, assembler code for a
block of data that contains the constant parts of a trampoline.  This
code should not include a label--the label is taken care of
automatically.

<p>If you do not define this macro, it means no template is needed
for the target.  Do not define this macro on systems where the block move
code to copy the trampoline into place would be larger than the code
to generate it on the spot.

<br><dt><code>TRAMPOLINE_SECTION</code>
<dd>The name of a subroutine to switch to the section in which the
trampoline template is to be placed (see <a href="#Sections">Sections</a>).  The default is
a value of <code>readonly_data_section</code>, which places the trampoline in
the section containing read-only data.

<br><dt><code>TRAMPOLINE_SIZE</code>
<dd>A C expression for the size in bytes of the trampoline, as an integer.

<br><dt><code>TRAMPOLINE_ALIGNMENT</code>
<dd>Alignment required for trampolines, in bits.

<p>If you don't define this macro, the value of <code>BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT</code>
is used for aligning trampolines.

<br><dt><code>INITIALIZE_TRAMPOLINE (<var>addr</var>, <var>fnaddr</var>, <var>static_chain</var>)</code>
<dd>A C statement to initialize the variable parts of a trampoline. 
<var>addr</var> is an RTX for the address of the trampoline; <var>fnaddr</var> is
an RTX for the address of the nested function; <var>static_chain</var> is an
RTX for the static chain value that should be passed to the function
when it is called.

<br><dt><code>ALLOCATE_TRAMPOLINE (<var>fp</var>)</code>
<dd>A C expression to allocate run-time space for a trampoline.  The
expression value should be an RTX representing a memory reference to the
space for the trampoline.

<p>If this macro is not defined, by default the trampoline is allocated as
a stack slot.  This default is right for most machines.  The exceptions
are machines where it is impossible to execute instructions in the stack
area.  On such machines, you may have to implement a separate stack,
using this macro in conjunction with <code>FUNCTION_PROLOGUE</code> and
<code>FUNCTION_EPILOGUE</code>.

<p><var>fp</var> points to a data structure, a <code>struct function</code>, which
describes the compilation status of the immediate containing function of
the function which the trampoline is for.  Normally (when
<code>ALLOCATE_TRAMPOLINE</code> is not defined), the stack slot for the
trampoline is in the stack frame of this containing function.  Other
allocation strategies probably must do something analogous with this
information. 
</dl>

<p>Implementing trampolines is difficult on many machines because they have
separate instruction and data caches.  Writing into a stack location
fails to clear the memory in the instruction cache, so when the program
jumps to that location, it executes the old contents.

<p>Here are two possible solutions.  One is to clear the relevant parts of
the instruction cache whenever a trampoline is set up.  The other is to
make all trampolines identical, by having them jump to a standard
subroutine.  The former technique makes trampoline execution faster; the
latter makes initialization faster.

<p>To clear the instruction cache when a trampoline is initialized, define
the following macros which describe the shape of the cache.

<dl>
<dt><code>INSN_CACHE_SIZE</code>
<dd>The total size in bytes of the cache.

<br><dt><code>INSN_CACHE_LINE_WIDTH</code>
<dd>The length in bytes of each cache line.  The cache is divided into cache
lines which are disjoint slots, each holding a contiguous chunk of data
fetched from memory.  Each time data is brought into the cache, an
entire line is read at once.  The data loaded into a cache line is
always aligned on a boundary equal to the line size.

<br><dt><code>INSN_CACHE_DEPTH</code>
<dd>The number of alternative cache lines that can hold any particular memory
location. 
</dl>

<p>Alternatively, if the machine has system calls or instructions to clear
the instruction cache directly, you can define the following macro.

<dl>
<dt><code>CLEAR_INSN_CACHE (<var>BEG</var>, <var>END</var>)</code>
<dd>If defined, expands to a C expression clearing the <em>instruction
cache</em> in the specified interval.  If it is not defined, and the macro
INSN_CACHE_SIZE is defined, some generic code is generated to clear the
cache.  The definition of this macro would typically be a series of
<code>asm</code> statements.  Both <var>BEG</var> and <var>END</var> are both pointer
expressions. 
</dl>

<p>To use a standard subroutine, define the following macro.  In addition,
you must make sure that the instructions in a trampoline fill an entire
cache line with identical instructions, or else ensure that the
beginning of the trampoline code is always aligned at the same point in
its cache line.  Look in <code>m68k.h</code> as a guide.

<dl>
<dt><code>TRANSFER_FROM_TRAMPOLINE</code>
<dd>Define this macro if trampolines need a special subroutine to do their
work.  The macro should expand to a series of <code>asm</code> statements
which will be compiled with GNU CC.  They go in a library function named
<code>__transfer_from_trampoline</code>.

<p>If you need to avoid executing the ordinary prologue code of a compiled
C function when you jump to the subroutine, you can do so by placing a
special label of your own in the assembler code.  Use one <code>asm</code>
statement to generate an assembler label, and another to make the label
global.  Then trampolines can use that label to jump directly to your
special assembler code.

<br><dt><code>MULDI3_LIBCALL</code>
<dd>A C string constant giving the name of the function to call for

initializing all the normal library routines.

<br><dt><code>TARGET_EDOM</code>
<dd>The value of <code>EDOM</code> on the target machine, as a C integer constant
expression.  If you don't define this macro, GNU CC does not attempt to
deposit the value of <code>EDOM</code> into <code>errno</code> directly.  Look in
<code>/usr/include/errno.h</code> to find the value of <code>EDOM</code> on your
system.

<p>If you do not define <code>TARGET_EDOM</code>, then compiled code reports
domain errors by calling the library function and letting it report the
error.  If mathematical functions on your system use <code>matherr</code> when
there is an error, then you should leave <code>TARGET_EDOM</code> undefined so
that <code>matherr</code> is used normally.

<br><dt><code>GEN_ERRNO_RTX</code>
<dd>Define this macro as a C expression to create an rtl expression that
refers to the global "variable" <code>errno</code>.  (On certain systems,
<code>errno</code> may not actually be a variable.)  If you don't define this
macro, a reasonable default is used.

<br><dt><code>TARGET_MEM_FUNCTIONS</code>
<dd>Define this macro if GNU CC should generate calls to the System V
(and ANSI C) library functions <code>memcpy</code> and <code>memset</code>
rather than the BSD functions <code>bcopy</code> and <code>bzero</code>.

<br><dt><code>LIBGCC_NEEDS_DOUBLE</code>
<dd>Define this macro if only <code>float</code> arguments cannot be passed to
library routines (so they must be converted to <code>double</code>).  This
macro affects both how library calls are generated and how the library
routines in <code>libgcc1.c</code> accept their arguments.  It is useful on
machines where floating and fixed point arguments are passed
differently, such as the i860.

<br><dt><code>FLOAT_ARG_TYPE</code>
<dd>Define this macro to override the type used by the library routines to
pick up arguments of type <code>float</code>.  (By default, they use a union
of <code>float</code> and <code>int</code>.)

<p>The obvious choice would be <code>float</code>--but that won't work with
traditional C compilers that expect all arguments declared as <code>float</code>
to arrive as <code>double</code>.  To avoid this conversion, the library routines
ask for the value as some other type and then treat it as a <code>float</code>.

<p>On some systems, no other type will work for this.  For these systems,
you must use <code>LIBGCC_NEEDS_DOUBLE</code> instead, to force conversion of
the values <code>double</code> before they are passed.

<br><dt><code>FLOATIFY (<var>passed-value</var>)</code>
<dd>Define this macro to override the way library routines redesignate a
<code>float</code> argument as a <code>float</code> instead of the type it was
passed as.  The default is an expression which takes the <code>float</code>
field of the union.

<br><dt><code>FLOAT_VALUE_TYPE</code>
<dd>Define this macro to override the type used by the library routines to
return values that ought to have type <code>float</code>.  (By default, they
use <code>int</code>.)

<p>The obvious choice would be <code>float</code>--but that won't work with
traditional C compilers gratuitously convert values declared as
<code>float</code> into <code>double</code>.

<br><dt><code>INTIFY (<var>float-value</var>)</code>
<dd>Define this macro to override the way the value of a
<code>float</code>-returning library routine should be packaged in order to
return it.  These functions are actually declared to return type
<code>FLOAT_VALUE_TYPE</code> (normally <code>int</code>).

<p>These values can't be returned as type <code>float</code> because traditional
C compilers would gratuitously convert the value to a <code>double</code>.

<p>A local variable named <code>intify</code> is always available when the macro
<code>INTIFY</code> is used.  It is a union of a <code>float</code> field named
<code>f</code> and a field named <code>i</code> whose type is
<code>FLOAT_VALUE_TYPE</code> or <code>int</code>.

<p>If you don't define this macro, the default definition works by copying
the value through that union.

<br><dt><code>nongcc_SI_type</code>
<dd>Define this macro as the name of the data type corresponding to
<code>SImode</code> in the system's own C compiler.

<p>You need not define this macro if that type is <code>long int</code>, as it usually
is.

<br><dt><code>nongcc_word_type</code>
<dd>Define this macro as the name of the data type corresponding to the
word_mode in the system's own C compiler.

<p>You need not define this macro if that type is <code>long int</code>, as it usually
is.

<br><dt><code>perform_<small>...</small></code>
<dd>Define these macros to supply explicit C statements to carry out various
arithmetic operations on types <code>float</code> and <code>double</code> in the
library routines in <code>libgcc1.c</code>.  See that file for a full list
of these macros and their arguments.

<p>On most machines, you don't need to define any of these macros, because
the C compiler that comes with the system takes care of doing them.

<br><dt><code>NEXT_OBJC_RUNTIME</code>
<dd>Define this macro to generate code for Objective C message sending using
the calling convention of the NeXT system.  This calling convention
involves passing the object, the selector and the method arguments all
at once to the method-lookup library function.

<p>The default calling convention passes just the object and the selector
to the lookup function, which returns a pointer to the method.

<h2>Addressing Modes</h2>

<p>This is about addressing modes.

<dl>
<dt><code>HAVE_POST_INCREMENT</code>
<dd>A C expression that is nonzero the machine supports post-increment addressing.

<br><dt><code>HAVE_PRE_INCREMENT</code>
<dt><code>HAVE_POST_DECREMENT</code>
<dt><code>HAVE_PRE_DECREMENT</code>
<dd>Similar for other kinds of addressing.

<br><dt><code>CONSTANT_ADDRESS_P (<var>x</var>)</code>
<dd>A C expression that is 1 if the RTX <var>x</var> is a constant which
is a valid address.  On most machines, this can be defined as
<code>CONSTANT_P (<var>x</var>)</code>, but a few machines are more restrictive
in which constant addresses are supported.

<p><code>CONSTANT_P</code> accepts integer-values expressions whose values are
not explicitly known, such as <code>symbol_ref</code>, <code>label_ref</code>, and
<code>high</code> expressions and <code>const</code> arithmetic expressions, in
addition to <code>const_int</code> and <code>const_double</code> expressions.

<br><dt><code>MAX_REGS_PER_ADDRESS</code>
<dd>A number, the maximum number of registers that can appear in a valid
memory address.  Note that it is up to you to specify a value equal to
the maximum number that <code>GO_IF_LEGITIMATE_ADDRESS</code> would ever
accept.

<br><dt><code>GO_IF_LEGITIMATE_ADDRESS (<var>mode</var>, <var>x</var>, <var>label</var>)</code>
<dd>A C compound statement with a conditional <code>goto <var>label</var>;</code>
executed if <var>x</var> (an RTX) is a legitimate memory address on the
target machine for a memory operand of mode <var>mode</var>.

<p>It usually pays to define several simpler macros to serve as
subroutines for this one.  Otherwise it may be too complicated to
understand.

<p>This macro must exist in two variants: a strict variant and a
non-strict one.  The strict variant is used in the reload pass.  It
must be defined so that any pseudo-register that has not been
allocated a hard register is considered a memory reference.  In
contexts where some kind of register is required, a pseudo-register
with no hard register must be rejected.

<p>The non-strict variant is used in other passes.  It must be defined to
accept all pseudo-registers in every context where some kind of
register is required.

<p>Compiler source files that want to use the strict variant of this
macro define the macro <code>REG_OK_STRICT</code>.  You should use an
<code>#ifdef REG_OK_STRICT</code> conditional to define the strict variant
in that case and the non-strict variant otherwise.

<p>Subroutines to check for acceptable registers for various purposes (one
for base registers, one for index registers, and so on) are typically
among the subroutines used to define <code>GO_IF_LEGITIMATE_ADDRESS</code>. 
Then only these subroutine macros need have two variants; the higher
levels of macros may be the same whether strict or not.

<p>Normally, constant addresses which are the sum of a <code>symbol_ref</code>
and an integer are stored inside a <code>const</code> RTX to mark them as
constant.  Therefore, there is no need to recognize such sums
specifically as legitimate addresses.  Normally you would simply
recognize any <code>const</code> as legitimate.

<p>Usually <code>PRINT_OPERAND_ADDRESS</code> is not prepared to handle constant
sums that are not marked with  <code>const</code>.  It assumes that a naked
<code>plus</code> indicates indexing.  If so, then you <em>must</em> reject such
naked constant sums as illegitimate addresses, so that none of them will
be given to <code>PRINT_OPERAND_ADDRESS</code>.

<p>On some machines, whether a symbolic address is legitimate depends on
the section that the address refers to.  On these machines, define the
macro <code>ENCODE_SECTION_INFO</code> to store the information into the
<code>symbol_ref</code>, and then check for it here.  When you see a
<code>const</code>, you will have to look inside it to find the
<code>symbol_ref</code> in order to determine the section.  See <a href="#Assembler%20Format">Assembler Format</a>.

<p>The best way to modify the name string is by adding text to the
beginning, with suitable punctuation to prevent any ambiguity.  Allocate
the new name in <code>saveable_obstack</code>.  You will have to modify
<code>ASM_OUTPUT_LABELREF</code> to remove and decode the added text and
output the name accordingly, and define <code>STRIP_NAME_ENCODING</code> to
access the original name string.

<p>You can check the information stored here into the <code>symbol_ref</code> in
the definitions of the macros <code>GO_IF_LEGITIMATE_ADDRESS</code> and
<code>PRINT_OPERAND_ADDRESS</code>.

<br><dt><code>REG_OK_FOR_BASE_P (<var>x</var>)</code>
<dd>A C expression that is nonzero if <var>x</var> (assumed to be a <code>reg</code>
RTX) is valid for use as a base register.  For hard registers, it
should always accept those which the hardware permits and reject the
others.  Whether the macro accepts or rejects pseudo registers must be
controlled by <code>REG_OK_STRICT</code> as described above.  This usually
requires two variant definitions, of which <code>REG_OK_STRICT</code>
controls the one actually used.

<br><dt><code>REG_MODE_OK_FOR_BASE_P (<var>x</var>, <var>mode</var>)</code>
<dd>A C expression that is just like <code>REG_OK_FOR_BASE_P</code>, except that
that expression may examine the mode of the memory reference in
<var>mode</var>.  You should define this macro if the mode of the memory
reference affects whether a register may be used as a base register.  If
you define this macro, the compiler will use it instead of
<code>REG_OK_FOR_BASE_P</code>.

<br><dt><code>REG_OK_FOR_INDEX_P (<var>x</var>)</code>
<dd>A C expression that is nonzero if <var>x</var> (assumed to be a <code>reg</code>
RTX) is valid for use as an index register.

<p>The difference between an index register and a base register is that
the index register may be scaled.  If an address involves the sum of
two registers, neither one of them scaled, then either one may be
labeled the "base" and the other the "index"; but whichever
labeling is used must fit the machine's constraints of which registers
may serve in each capacity.  The compiler will try both labelings,
looking for one that is valid, and will reload one or both registers
only if neither labeling works.

<br><dt><code>LEGITIMIZE_ADDRESS (<var>x</var>, <var>oldx</var>, <var>mode</var>, <var>win</var>)</code>
<dd>A C compound statement that attempts to replace <var>x</var> with a valid
memory address for an operand of mode <var>mode</var>.  <var>win</var> will be a
C statement label elsewhere in the code; the macro definition may use

<pre>GO_IF_LEGITIMATE_ADDRESS (<var>mode</var>, <var>x</var>, <var>win</var>);
</pre>

<p>to avoid further processing if the address has become legitimate.

<p><var>x</var> will always be the result of a call to <code>break_out_memory_refs</code>,
and <var>oldx</var> will be the operand that was given to that function to produce
<var>x</var>.

<p>The code generated by this macro should not alter the substructure of
<var>x</var>.  If it transforms <var>x</var> into a more legitimate form, it
should assign <var>x</var> (which will always be a C variable) a new value.

<p>It is not necessary for this macro to come up with a legitimate
address.  The compiler has standard ways of doing so in all cases.  In
fact, it is safe for this macro to do nothing.  But often a
machine-dependent strategy can generate better code.

<br><dt><code>LEGITIMIZE_RELOAD_ADDRESS (<var>x</var>, <var>mode</var>, <var>opnum</var>, <var>type</var>, <var>ind_levels</var>, <var>win</var>)</code>
<dd>A C compound statement that attempts to replace <var>x</var>, which is an address
that needs reloading, with a valid memory address for an operand of mode
<var>mode</var>.  <var>win</var> will be a C statement label elsewhere in the code. 
It is not necessary to define this macro, but it might be useful for
performance reasons.

<p>For example, on the i386, it is sometimes possible to use a single
reload register instead of two by reloading a sum of two pseudo
registers into a register.  On the other hand, for number of RISC
processors offsets are limited so that often an intermediate address
needs to be generated in order to address a stack slot.  By defining
LEGITIMIZE_RELOAD_ADDRESS appropriately, the intermediate addresses
generated for adjacent some stack slots can be made identical, and thus
be shared.

<p><em>Note</em>: This macro should be used with caution.  It is necessary
to know something of how reload works in order to effectively use this,
and it is quite easy to produce macros that build in too much knowledge
of reload internals.

<p><em>Note</em>: This macro must be able to reload an address created by a
previous invocation of this macro.  If it fails to handle such addresses
then the compiler may generate incorrect code or abort.

<p>The macro definition should use <code>push_reload</code> to indicate parts that
need reloading; <var>opnum</var>, <var>type</var> and <var>ind_levels</var> are usually
suitable to be passed unaltered to <code>push_reload</code>.

<p>The code generated by this macro must not alter the substructure of
<var>x</var>.  If it transforms <var>x</var> into a more legitimate form, it
should assign <var>x</var> (which will always be a C variable) a new value. 
This also applies to parts that you change indirectly by calling
<code>push_reload</code>.

<p>The macro definition may use <code>strict_memory_address_p</code> to test if
the address has become legitimate.

<p>If you want to change only a part of <var>x</var>, one standard way of doing
this is to use <code>copy_rtx</code>.  Note, however, that is unshares only a
single level of rtl.  Thus, if the part to be changed is not at the
top level, you'll need to replace first the top leve
It is not necessary for this macro to come up with a legitimate
address;  but often a machine-dependent strategy can generate better code.

<br><dt><code>GO_IF_MODE_DEPENDENT_ADDRESS (<var>addr</var>, <var>label</var>)</code>
<dd>A C statement or compound statement with a conditional <code>goto
<var>label</var>;</code> executed if memory address <var>x</var> (an RTX) can have
different meanings depending on the machine mode of the memory
reference it is used for or if the address is valid for some modes
but not others.

<p>Autoincrement and autodecrement addresses typically have mode-dependent
effects because the amount of the increment or decrement is the size
of the operand being addressed.  Some machines have other mode-dependent
addresses.  Many RISC machines have no mode-dependent addresses.

<p>You may assume that <var>addr</var> is a valid address for the machine.

<br><dt><code>LEGITIMATE_CONSTANT_P (<var>x</var>)</code>
<dd>A C expression that is nonzero if <var>x</var> is a legitimate constant for
an immediate operand on the target machine.  You can assume that
<var>x</var> satisfies <code>CONSTANT_P</code>, so you need not check this.  In fact,
<code>1</code> is a suitable definition for this macro on machines where
anything <code>CONSTANT_P</code> is valid.

<h2>Condition Code Status</h2>

<p>This describes the condition code status.

<p>The file <code>conditions.h</code> defines a variable <code>cc_status</code> to
describe how the condition code was computed (in case the interpretation of
the condition code depends on the instruction that it was set by).  This
variable contains the RTL expressions on which the condition code is
currently based, and several standard flags.

<p>Sometimes additional machine-specific flags must be defined in the machine
description header file.  It can also add additional machine-specific
information by defining <code>CC_STATUS_MDEP</code>.

<dl>
<dt><code>CC_STATUS_MDEP</code>
<dd>C code for a data type which is used for declaring the <code>mdep</code>
component of <code>cc_status</code>.  It defaults to <code>int</code>.

<p>This macro is not used on machines that do not use <code>cc0</code>.

<br><dt><code>CC_STATUS_MDEP_INIT</code>
<dd>A C expression to initialize the <code>mdep</code> field to "empty". 
The default definition does nothing, since most machines don't use
the field anyway.  If you want to use the field, you should probably
define this macro to initialize it.

<p>This macro is not used on machines that do not use <code>cc0</code>.

<br><dt><code>NOTICE_UPDATE_CC (<var>exp</var>, <var>insn</var>)</code>
<dd>A C compound statement to set the components of <code>cc_status</code>
appropriately for an insn <var>insn</var> whose body is <var>exp</var>.  It is
this macro's responsibility to recognize insns that set the condition
code as a byproduct of other activity as well as those that explicitly
set <code>(cc0)</code>.

<p>This macro is not used on machines that do not use <code>cc0</code>.

<p>If there are insns that do not set the condition code but do alter
other machine registers, this macro must check to see whether they
invalidate the expressions that the condition code is recorded as
reflecting.  For example, on the 68000, insns that store in address
registers do not set the condition code, which means that usually
<code>NOTICE_UPDATE_CC</code> can leave <code>cc_status</code> unaltered for such
insns.  But suppose that the previous insn set the condition code
based on location <code>a4@(102)</code> and the current insn stores a new
value in <code>a4</code>.  Although the condition code is not changed by
this, it will no longer be true that it reflects the contents of
<code>a4@(102)</code>.  Therefore, <code>NOTICE_UPDATE_CC</code> must alter
<code>cc_status</code> in this case to say that nothing is known about the
condition code value.

<p>The definition of <code>NOTICE_UPDATE_CC</code> must be prepared to deal
with the results of peephole optimization: insns whose patterns are
<code>parallel</code> RTXs containing various <code>reg</code>, <code>mem</code> or
constants which are just the operands.  The RTL structure of these
insns is not sufficient to indicate what the insns actually do.  What
<code>NOTICE_UPDATE_CC</code> should do when it sees one is just to run
<code>CC_STATUS_INIT</code>.

<p>A possible definition of <code>NOTICE_UPDATE_CC</code> is to call a function
that looks at an attribute (see <a href="#Insn%20Attributes">Insn Attributes</a>) named, for example,
<code>cc</code>.  This avoids having detailed information about patterns in
two places, the <code>md</code> file and in <code>NOTICE_UPDATE_CC</code>.

<br><dt><code>EXTRA_CC_MODES</code>
<dd>A list of names to be used for additional modes for condition code
values in registers (see <a href="#Jump%20Patterns">Jump Patterns</a>).  These names are added
to <code>enum machine_mode</code> and all have class <code>MODE_CC</code>.  By
convention, they should start with <code>CC</code> and end with <code>mode</code>.

<p>You should only define this macro if your machine does not use <code>cc0</code>
and only if additional modes are required.

<br><dt><code>EXTRA_CC_NAMES</code>
<dd>A list of C strings giving the names for the modes listed in
<code>EXTRA_CC_MODES</code>.  For example, the Sparc defines this macro and
<code>EXTRA_CC_MODES</code> as

<pre>#define EXTRA_CC_MODES CC_NOOVmode, CCFPmode, CCFPEmode
#define EXTRA_CC_NAMES "CC_NOOV", "CCFP", "CCFPE"
</pre>

<p>This macro is not required if <code>EXTRA_CC_MODES</code> is not defined.

<br><dt><code>SELECT_CC_MODE (<var>op</var>, <var>x</var>, <var>y</var>)</code>
<dd>Returns a mode from class <code>MODE_CC</code> to be used when comparison
operation code <var>op</var> is applied to rtx <var>x</var> and <var>y</var>.  For
example, on the Sparc, <code>SELECT_CC_MODE</code> is defined as (see
see <a href="#Jump%20Patterns">Jump Patterns</a> for a description of the reason for this
definition)

<pre>#define SELECT_CC_MODE(OP,X,Y) \
  (GET_MODE_CLASS (GET_MODE (X)) == MODE_FLOAT          \
   ? ((OP == EQ || OP == NE) ? CCFPmode : CCFPEmode)    \
   : ((GET_CODE (X) == PLUS || GET_CODE (X) == MINUS    \
       || GET_CODE (X) == NEG) \
      ? CC_NOOVmode : CCmode))
</pre>

<p>You need not define this macro if <code>EXTRA_CC_MODES</code> is not defined.

<br><dt><code>CANONICALIZE_COMPARISON (<var>code</var>, <var>op0</var>, <var>op1</var>)</code>
<dd>One some machines not all possible comparisons are defined, but you can
convert an invalid comparison into a valid one.  For example, the Alpha
does not have a <code>GT</code> comparison, but you can use an <code>LT</code>
comparison instead and swap the order of the operands.

<p>On such machines, define this macro to be a C statement to do any
required conversions.  <var>code</var> is the initial comparison code
and <var>op0</var> and <var>op1</var> are the left and right operands of the
comparison, respectively.  You should modify <var>code</var>, <var>op0</var>, and
<var>op1</var> as required.

<p>GNU CC will not assume that the comparison resulting from this macro is
valid but will see if the resulting insn matches a pattern in the
<code>md</code> file.

<p>You need not define this macro if it would never change the comparison
code or operands.

<br><dt><code>REVERSIBLE_CC_MODE (<var>mode</var>)</code>
<dd>A C expression whose value is one if it is always safe to reverse a
comparison whose mode is <var>mode</var>.  If <code>SELECT_CC_MODE</code>
can ever return <var>mode</var> for a floating-point inequality comparison,
then <code>REVERSIBLE_CC_MODE (<var>mode</var>)</code> must be zero.

<p>You need not define this macro if it would always returns zero or if the
floating-point format is anything other than <code>IEEE_FLOAT_FORMAT</code>. 
For example, here is the definition used on the Sparc, where floating-point
inequality comparisons are always given <code>CCFPEmode</code>:

<pre>#define REVERSIBLE_CC_MODE(MODE)  ((MODE) != CCFPEmode)
</pre>

<h2>Describing Relative Costs of Operations</h2>

<p>These macros let you describe the relative speed of various operations
on the target machine.

<dl>
<dt><code>CONST_COSTS (<var>x</var>, <var>code</var>, <var>outer_code</var>)</code>
<dd>A part of a C <code>switch</code> statement that describes the relative costs
of constant RTL expressions.  It must contain <code>case</code> labels for
expression codes <code>const_int</code>, <code>const</code>, <code>symbol_ref</code>,
<code>label_ref</code> and <code>const_double</code>.  Each case must ultimately
reach a <code>return</code> statement to return the relative cost of the use
of that kind of constant value in an expression.  The cost may depend on
the precise value of the constant, which is available for examination in
<var>x</var>, and the rtx code of the expression in which it is contained,
found in <var>outer_code</var>.

<p><var>code</var> is the expression code--redundant, since it can be
obtained with <code>GET_CODE (<var>x</var>)</code>.

<br><dt><code>RTX_COSTS (<var>x</var>, <var>code</var>, <var>outer_code</var>)</code>
<dd>Like <code>CONST_COSTS</code> but applies to nonconstant RTL expressions. 
This can be used, for example, to indicate how costly a multiply
instruction is.  In writing this macro, you can use the construct
<code>COSTS_N_INSNS (<var>n</var>)</code> to specify a cost equal to <var>n</var> fast
instructions.  <var>outer_code</var> is the code of the expression in which
<var>x</var> is contained.

<p>This macro is optional; do not define it if the default cost assumptions
are adequate for the target machine.

<br><dt><code>DEFAULT_RTX_COSTS (<var>x</var>, <var>code</var>, <var>outer_code</var>)</code>
<dd>This macro, if defined, is called for any case not handled by the
<code>RTX_COSTS</code> or <code>CONST_COSTS</code> macros.  This eliminates the need
to put case labels into the macro, but the code, or any functions it
calls, must assume that the RTL in <var>x</var> could be of any type that has
not already been handled.  The arguments are the same as for
<code>RTX_COSTS</code>, and the macro should execute a return statement giving
the cost of any RTL expressions that it can handle.  The default cost
calculation is used for any RTL for which this macro does not return a
value.

<p>This macro is optional; do not define it if the default cost assumptions
are adequate for the target machine.

<br><dt><code>ADDRESS_COST (<var>address</var>)</code>
<dd>An expression giving the cost of an addressing mode that contains
<var>address</var>.  If not defined, the cost is computed from
the <var>address</var> expression and the <code>CONST_COSTS</code> values.

<p>For most CISC machines, the default cost is a good approximation of the
true cost of the addressing mode.  However, on RISC machines, all
instructions normally have the same length and execution time.  Hence
all addresses will have equal costs.

<p>In cases where more than one form of an address is known, the form with
the lowest cost will be used.  If multiple forms have the same, lowest,
cost, the one that is the most complex will be used.

<p>For example, suppose an address that is equal to the sum of a register
and a constant is used twice in the same basic block.  When this macro
is not defined, the address will be computed in a register and memory
references will be indirect through that register.  On machines where
the cost of the addressing mode containing the sum is no higher than
that of a simple indirect reference, this will produce an additional
instruction and possibly require an additional register.  Proper
specification of this macro eliminates this overhead for such machines.

<p>Similar use of this macro is made in strength reduction of loops.

<p><var>address</var> need not be valid as an address.  In such a case, the cost
is not relevant and can be any value; invalid addresses need not be
assigned a different cost.

<p>On machines where an address involving more than one register is as
cheap as an address computation involving only one register, defining
<code>ADDRESS_COST</code> to reflect this can cause two registers to be live
over a region of code where only one would have been if
<code>ADDRESS_COST</code> were not defined in that manner.  This effect should
be considered in the definition of this macro.  Equivalent costs should
probably only be given to addresses with different numbers of registers
on machines with lots of registers.

<p>This macro will normally either not be defined or be defined as a
constant.

<br><dt><code>REGISTER_MOVE_COST (<var>from</var>, <var>to</var>)</code>
<dd>A C expression for the cost of moving data from a register in class
<var>from</var> to one in class <var>to</var>.  The classes are expressed using
the enumeration values such as <code>GENERAL_REGS</code>.  A value of 2 is the
default; other values are interpreted relative to that.

<p>It is not required that the cost always equal 2 when <var>from</var> is the
same as <var>to</var>; on some machines it is expensive to move between
registers if they are not general registers.

<p>If reload sees an insn consisting of a single <code>set</code> between two
hard registers, and if <code>REGISTER_MOVE_COST</code> applied to their
classes returns a value of 2, reload does not check to ensure that the
constraints of the insn are met.  Setting a cost of other than 2 will
allow reload to verify that the constraints are met.  You should do this
if the <code>mov<var>m</var></code> pattern's constraints do not allow such copying.

<br><dt><code>MEMORY_MOVE_COST (<var>mode</var>, <var>class</var>, <var>in</var>)</code>
<dd>A C expression for the cost of moving data of mode <var>mode</var> between a
register of class <var>class</var> and memory; <var>in</var> is zero if the value
is to be written to memory, non-zero if it is to be read in.  This cost
is relative to those in <code>REGISTER_MOVE_COST</code>.  If moving between
registers and memory is more expensive than between two registers, you
should define this macro to express the relative cost.

<p>If you do not define this macro, GNU CC uses a default cost of 4 plus
the cost of copying via a secondary reload register, if one is
needed.  If your machine requires a secondary reload register to copy
between memory and a register of <var>class</var> but the reload mechanism is
more complex than copying via an intermediate, define this macro to
reflect the actual cost of the move.

<p>GNU CC defines the function <code>memory_move_secondary_cost</code> if
secondary reloads are needed.  It computes the costs due to copying via
a secondary register.  If your machine copies from memory using a
secondary register in the conventional way but the default base value of
4 is not correct for your machine, define this macro to add some other
value to the result of that function.  The arguments to that function
are the same as to this macro.

<br><dt><code>BRANCH_COST</code>
<dd>A C expression for the cost of a branch instruction.  A value of 1 is
the default; other values are interpreted relative to that. 
</dl>

<p>Here are additional macros which do not specify precise relative costs,
but only that certain actions are more expensive than GNU CC would
ordinarily expect.

<dl>
<dt><code>SLOW_BYTE_ACCESS</code>
<dd>Define this macro as a C expression which is nonzero if accessing less
than a word of memory (i.e. a <code>char</code> or a <code>short</code>) is no
faster than accessing a word of memory, i.e., if such access
require more than one instruction or if there is no difference in cost
between byte and (aligned) word loads.

<p>When this macro is not defined, the compiler will access a field by
finding the smallest containing object; when it is defined, a fullword
load will be used if alignment permits.  Unless bytes accesses are
faster than word accesses, using word accesses is preferable since it
may eliminate subsequent memory access if subsequent accesses occur to
other fields in the same word of the structure, but to different bytes.

<br><dt><code>SLOW_ZERO_EXTEND</code>
<dd>Define this macro if zero-extension (of a <code>char</code> or <code>short</code>
to an <code>int</code>) can be done faster if the destination is a register
that is known to be zero.

<p>If you define this macro, you must have instruction patterns that
recognize RTL structures like this:

<pre>(set (strict_low_part (subreg:QI (reg:SI <small>...</small>) 0)) <small>...</small>)
</pre>

<p>and likewise for <code>HImode</code>.

<br><dt><code>SLOW_UNALIGNED_ACCESS</code>
<dd>Define this macro to be the value 1 if unaligned accesses have a cost
many times greater than aligned accesses, for example if they are
emulated in a trap handler.

<p>When this macro is non-zero, the compiler will act as if
<code>STRICT_ALIGNMENT</code> were non-zero when generating code for block
moves.  This can cause significantly more instructions to be produced. 
Therefore, do not set this macro non-zero if unaligned accesses only add a
cycle or two to the time for a memory access.

<p>If the value of this macro is always zero, it need not be defined.

<br><dt><code>DONT_REDUCE_ADDR</code>
<dd>Define this macro to inhibit strength reduction of memory addresses. 
(On some machines, such strength reduction seems to do harm rather
than good.)

<br><dt><code>MOVE_RATIO</code>
<dd>The threshold of number of scalar memory-to-memory move insns, <em>below</em>
which a sequence of insns  should be generated instead of a
string move insn or a library call.  Increasing the value will always
make code faster, but eventually incurs high cost in increased code size.

<p>Note that on machines with no memory-to-memory move insns, this macro denotes
the corresponding number of memory-to-memory <em>sequences</em>.

<p>If you don't define this, a reasonable default is used.

<br><dt><code>MOVE_BY_PIECES_P (<var>size</var>, <var>alignment</var>)</code>
<dd>A C expression used to determine whether <code>move_by_pieces</code> will be used to
copy a chunk of memory, or whether some other block move mechanism
will be used.  Defaults to 1 if <code>move_by_pieces_ninsns</code> returns less
than <code>MOVE_RATIO</code>.

<br><dt><code>MOVE_MAX_PIECES</code>
<dd>A C expression used by <code>move_by_pieces</code> to determine the largest unit
a load or store used to copy memory is.  Defaults to <code>MOVE_MAX</code>.

<br><dt><code>USE_LOAD_POST_INCREMENT (<var>mode</var>)</code>
<dd>A C expression used to determine whether a load postincrement is a good
thing to use for a given mode.  Defaults to the value of
<code>HAVE_POST_INCREMENT</code>.

<br><dt><code>USE_LOAD_POST_DECREMENT (<var>mode</var>)</code>
<dd>A C expression used to determine whether a load postdecrement is a good
thing to use for a given mode.  Defaults to the value of
<code>HAVE_POST_DECREMENT</code>.

<br><dt><code>USE_LOAD_PRE_INCREMENT (<var>mode</var>)</code>
<dd>A C expression used to determine whether a load preincrement is a good
thing to use for a given mode.  Defaults to the value of
<code>HAVE_PRE_INCREMENT</code>.

<br><dt><code>USE_LOAD_PRE_DECREMENT (<var>mode</var>)</code>
<dd>A C expression used to determine whether a load predecrement is a good
thing to use for a given mode.  Defaults to the value of
<code>HAVE_PRE_DECREMENT</code>.

<br><dt><code>USE_STORE_POST_INCREMENT (<var>mode</var>)</code>
<dd>A C expression used to determine whether a store postincrement is a good
thing to use for a given mode.  Defaults to the value of
<code>HAVE_POST_INCREMENT</code>.

<br><dt><code>USE_STORE_POST_DECREMENT (<var>mode</var>)</code>
<dd>A C expression used to determine whether a store postdeccrement is a good
thing to use for a given mode.  Defaults to the value of
<code>HAVE_POST_DECREMENT</code>.

<br><dt><code>USE_STORE_PRE_INCREMENT (<var>mode</var>)</code>
<dd>This macro is used to determine whether a store preincrement is a good
thing to use for a given mode.  Defaults to the value of
<code>HAVE_PRE_INCREMENT</code>.

<br><dt><code>USE_STORE_PRE_DECREMENT (<var>mode</var>)</code>
<dd>This macro is used to determine whether a store predecrement is a good
thing to use for a given mode.  Defaults to the value of
<code>HAVE_PRE_DECREMENT</code>.

<br><dt><code>NO_FUNCTION_CSE</code>
<dd>Define this macro if it is as good or better to call a constant
function address than to call an address kept in a register.

<br><dt><code>NO_RECURSIVE_FUNCTION_CSE</code>
<dd>Define this macro if it is as good or better for a function to call
itself with an explicit address than to call an address kept in a
register.

<br><dt><code>ADJUST_COST (<var>insn</var>, <var>link</var>, <var>dep_insn</var>, <var>cost</var>)</code>
<dd>A C statement (sans semicolon) to update the integer variable <var>cost</var>
based on the relationship between <var>insn</var> that is dependent on
<var>dep_insn</var> through the dependence <var>link</var>.  The default is to
make no adjustment to <var>cost</var>.  This can be used for example to
specify to the scheduler that an output- or anti-dependence does not
incur the same cost as a data-dependence.

<br><dt><code>ADJUST_PRIORITY (<var>insn</var>)</code>
<dd>A C statement (sans semicolon) to update the integer scheduling
priority <code>INSN_PRIORITY(<var>insn</var>)</code>.  Reduce the priority
to execute the <var>insn</var> earlier, increase the priority to execute
<var>insn</var> later.    Do not define this macro if you do not need to
adjust the scheduling priorities of insns.

<h2>Dividing the Output into Sections (Texts, Data, <small>...</small>)</h2>

<p>An object file is divided into sections containing different types of
data.  In the most common case, there are three sections: the <dfn>text
section</dfn>, which holds instructions and read-only data; the <dfn>data
section</dfn>, which holds initialized writable data; and the <dfn>bss
section</dfn>, which holds uninitialized data.  Some systems have other kinds
of sections.

<p>The compiler must tell the assembler when to switch sections.  These
macros control what commands to output to tell the assembler this.  You
can also define additional sections.

<dl>
<dt><code>TEXT_SECTION_ASM_OP</code>
<dd>A C expression whose value is a string containing the assembler
operation that should precede instructions and read-only data.  Normally
<code>".text"</code> is right.

<br><dt><code>DATA_SECTION_ASM_OP</code>
<dd>A C expression whose value is a string containing the assembler
operation to identify the following data as writable initialized data. 
Normally <code>".data"</code> is right.

<br><dt><code>SHARED_SECTION_ASM_OP</code>
<dd>If defined, a C expression whose value is a string containing the
assembler operation to identify the following data as shared data.  If
not defined, <code>DATA_SECTION_ASM_OP</code> will be used.

<br><dt><code>BSS_SECTION_ASM_OP</code>
<dd>If defined, a C expression whose value is a string containing the
assembler operation to identify the following data as uninitialized global
data.  If not defined, and neither <code>ASM_OUTPUT_BSS</code> nor
<code>ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGNED_BSS</code> are defined, uninitialized global data will be
output in the data section if <code>-fno-common</code> is passed, otherwise
<code>ASM_OUTPUT_COMMON</code> will be used.

<br><dt><code>SHARED_BSS_SECTION_ASM_OP</code>
<dd>If defined, a C expression whose value is a string containing the
assembler operation to identify the following data as uninitialized global
shared data.  If not defined, and <code>BSS_SECTION_ASM_OP</code> is, the latter
will be used.

<br><dt><code>INIT_SECTION_ASM_OP</code>
<dd>If defined, a C expression whose value is a string containing the
assembler operation to identify the following data as initialization
code.  If not defined, GNU CC will assume such a section does not
exist.

<br><dt><code>EXTRA_SECTIONS</code>
<dd>A list of names for sections other than the standard two, which are
<code>in_text</code> and <code>in_data</code>.  You need not define this macro
on a system with no other sections (that GCC needs to use).

<br><dt><code>EXTRA_SECTION_FUNCTIONS</code>
<dd>One or more functions to be defined in <code>varasm.c</code>.  These
functions should do jobs analogous to those of <code>text_section</code> and
<code>data_section</code>, for your additional sections.  Do not define this
macro if you do not define <code>EXTRA_SECTIONS</code>.

<br><dt><code>READONLY_DATA_SECTION</code>
<dd>On most machines, read-only variables, constants, and jump tables are
placed in the text section.  If this is not the case on your machine,
this macro should be defined to be the name of a function (either
<code>data_section</code> or a function defined in <code>EXTRA_SECTIONS</code>) that
switches to the section to be used for read-only items.

<p>If these items should be placed in the text section, this macro should
not be defined.

<br><dt><code>SELECT_SECTION (<var>exp</var>, <var>reloc</var>)</code>
<dd>A C statement or statements to switch to the appropriate section for
output of <var>exp</var>.  You can assume that <var>exp</var> is either a
<code>VAR_DECL</code> node or a constant of some sort.  <var>reloc</var>
indicates whether the initial value of <var>exp</var> requires link-time
relocations.  Select the section by calling <code>text_section</code> or one
of the alternatives for other sections.

<p>Do not define this macro if you put all read-only variables and
constants in the read-only data section (usually the text section).

<br><dt><code>SELECT_RTX_SECTION (<var>mode</var>, <var>rtx</var>)</code>
<dd>A C statement or statements to switch to the appropriate section for
output of <var>rtx</var> in mode <var>mode</var>.  You can assume that <var>rtx</var>
is some kind of constant in RTL.  The argument <var>mode</var> is redundant
except in the case of a <code>const_int</code> rtx.  Select the section by
calling <code>text_section</code> or one of the alternatives for other
sections.

<p>Do not define this macro if you put all constants in the read-only
data section.

<br><dt><code>JUMP_TABLES_IN_TEXT_SECTION</code>
<dd>Define this macro to be an expression with a non-zero value if jump
tables (for <code>tablejump</code> insns) should be output in the text
section, along with the assembler instructions.  Otherwise, the
readonly data section is used.

<p>This macro is irrelevant if there is no separate readonly data section.

<br><dt><code>ENCODE_SECTION_INFO (<var>decl</var>)</code>
<dd>Define this macro if references to a symbol must be treated differently
depending on something about the variable or function named by the
symbol (such as what section it is in).

<p>The macro definition, if any, is executed immediately after the rtl for
<var>decl</var> has been created and stored in <code>DECL_RTL (<var>decl</var>)</code>. 
The value of the rtl will be a <code>mem</code> whose address is a
<code>symbol_ref</code>.

<p>The usual thing for this macro to do is to record a flag in the
<code>symbol_ref</code> (such as <code>SYMBOL_REF_FLAG</code>) or to store a
modified name string in the <code>symbol_ref</code> (if one bit is not enough
information).

<br><dt><code>STRIP_NAME_ENCODING (<var>var</var>, <var>sym_name</var>)</code>
<dd>Decode <var>sym_name</var> and store the real name part in <var>var</var>, sans
the characters that encode section info.  Define this macro if
<code>ENCODE_SECTION_INFO</code> alters the symbol's name string.

<br><dt><code>UNIQUE_SECTION_P (<var>decl</var>)</code>
<dd>A C expression which evaluates to true if <var>decl</var> should be placed
into a unique section for some target-specific reason.  If you do not
define this macro, the default is <code>0</code>.  Note that the flag
<code>-ffunction-sections</code> will also cause functions to be placed into
unique sections.

<br><dt><code>UNIQUE_SECTION (<var>decl</var>, <var>reloc</var>)</code>
<dd>A C statement to build up a unique section name, expressed as a
STRING_CST node, and assign it to <code>DECL_SECTION_NAME (<var>decl</var>)</code>. 
<var>reloc</var> indicates whether the initial value of <var>exp</var> requires
link-time relocations.  If you do not define this macro, GNU CC will use
the symbol name prefixed by <code>.</code> as the section name.

<h2>Position Independent Code</h2>

<p>This section describes macros that help implement generation of position
independent code.  Simply defining these macros is not enough to
generate valid PIC; you must also add support to the macros
<code>GO_IF_LEGITIMATE_ADDRESS</code> and <code>PRINT_OPERAND_ADDRESS</code>, as
well as <code>LEGITIMIZE_ADDRESS</code>.  You must modify the definition of
<code>movsi</code> to do something appropriate when the source operand
contains a symbolic address.  You may also need to alter the handling of
switch statements so that they use relative addresses.

<dl>
<dt><code>PIC_OFFSET_TABLE_REGNUM</code>
<dd>The register number of the register used to address a table of static
data addresses in memory.  In some cases this register is defined by a
processor's "application binary interface" (ABI).  When this macro
is defined, RTL is generated for this register once, as with the stack
pointer and frame pointer registers.  If this macro is not defined, it
is up to the machine-dependent files to allocate such a register (if
necessary).

<br><dt><code>PIC_OFFSET_TABLE_REG_CALL_CLOBBERED</code>
<dd>Define this macro if the register defined by
<code>PIC_OFFSET_TABLE_REGNUM</code> is clobbered by calls.  Do not define
this macro if <code>PIC_OFFSET_TABLE_REGNUM</code> is not defined.

<br><dt><code>FINALIZE_PIC</code>
<dd>By generating position-independent code, when two different programs (A
and B) share a common library (libC.a), the text of the library can be
shared whether or not the library is linked at the same address for both
programs.  In some of these environments, position-independent code
requires not only the use of different addressing modes, but also
special code to enable the use of these addressing modes.

<p>The <code>FINALIZE_PIC</code> macro serves as a hook to emit these special
codes once the function is being compiled into assembly code, but not
before.  (It is not done before, because in the case of compiling an
inline function, it would lead to multiple PIC prologues being
included in functions which used inline functions and were compiled to
assembly language.)

<br><dt><code>LEGITIMATE_PIC_OPERAND_P (<var>x</var>)</code>
<dd>A C expression that is nonzero if <var>x</var> is a legitimate immediate
operand on the target machine when generating position independent code. 
You can assume that <var>x</var> satisfies <code>CONSTANT_P</code>, so you need not
check this.  You can also assume <var>flag_pic</var> is true, so you need not
check it either.  You need not define this macro if all constants
(including <code>SYMBOL_REF</code>) can be immediate operands when generating
position independent code.

<h3>The Overall Framework of an Assembler File</h3>

<p>This describes the overall framework of an assembler file.

<dl>
<dt><code>ASM_FILE_START (<var>stream</var>)</code>
<dd>A C expression which outputs to the stdio stream <var>stream</var>
some appropriate text to go at the start of an assembler file.

<p>Normally this macro is defined to output a line containing
<code>#NO_APP</code>, which is a comment that has no effect on most
assemblers but tells the GNU assembler that it can save time by not
checking for certain assembler constructs.

<p>On systems that use SDB, it is necessary to output certain commands;
see <code>attasm.h</code>.

<br><dt><code>ASM_FILE_END (<var>stream</var>)</code>
<dd>A C expression which outputs to the stdio stream <var>stream</var>
some appropriate text to go at the end of an assembler file.

<p>If this macro is not defined, the default is to output nothing
special at the end of the file.  Most systems don't require any
definition.

<p>On systems that use SDB, it is necessary to output certain commands;
see <code>attasm.h</code>.

<br><dt><code>ASM_IDENTIFY_GCC (<var>file</var>)</code>
<dd>A C statement to output assembler commands which will identify
the object file as having been compiled with GNU CC (or another
GNU compiler).

<p>If you don't define this macro, the string <code>gcc_compiled.:</code>
is output.  This string is calculated to define a symbol which,
on BSD systems, will never be defined for any other reason. 
GDB checks for the presence of this symbol when reading the
symbol table of an executable.

<p>On non-BSD systems, you must arrange communication with GDB in
some other fashion.  If GDB is not used on your system, you can
define this macro with an empty body.

<br><dt><code>ASM_COMMENT_START</code>
<dd>A C string constant describing how to begin a comment in the target
assembler language.  The compiler assumes that the comment will end at
the end of the line.

<br><dt><code>ASM_APP_ON</code>
<dd>A C string constant for text to be output before each <code>asm</code>
statement or group of consecutive ones.  Normally this is
<code>"#APP"</code>, which is a comment that has no effect on most
assemblers but tells the GNU assembler that it must check the lines
that follow for all valid assembler constructs.

<br><dt><code>ASM_APP_OFF</code>
<dd>A C string constant for text to be output after each <code>asm</code>
statement or group of consecutive ones.  Normally this is
<code>"#NO_APP"</code>, which tells the GNU assembler to resume making the
time-saving assumptions that are valid for ordinary compiler output.

<br><dt><code>ASM_OUTPUT_SOURCE_FILENAME (<var>stream</var>, <var>name</var>)</code>
<dd>A C statement to output COFF information or DWARF debugging information
which indicates that filename <var>name</var> is the current source file to
the stdio stream <var>stream</var>.

<p>This macro need not be defined if the standard form of output
for the file format in use is appropriate.

<br><dt><code>OUTPUT_QUOTED_STRING (<var>stream</var>, <var>name</var>)</code>
<dd>A C statement to output the string <var>string</var> to the stdio stream
<var>stream</var>.  If you do not call the function <code>output_quoted_string</code>
in your config files, GNU CC will only call it to output filenames to
the assembler source.  So you can use it to canonicalize the format
of the filename using this macro.

<br><dt><code>ASM_OUTPUT_SOURCE_LINE (<var>stream</var>, <var>line</var>)</code>
<dd>A C statement to output DBX or SDB debugging information before code
for line number <var>line</var> of the current source file to the
stdio stream <var>stream</var>.

<p>This macro need not be defined if the standard form of debugging
information for the debugger in use is appropriate.

<br><dt><code>ASM_OUTPUT_IDENT (<var>stream</var>, <var>string</var>)</code>
<dd>A C statement to output something to the assembler file to handle a
<code>#ident</code> directive containing the text <var>string</var>.  If this
macro is not defined, nothing is output for a <code>#ident</code> directive.

<br><dt><code>ASM_OUTPUT_SECTION_NAME (<var>stream</var>, <var>decl</var>, <var>name</var>, <var>reloc</var>)</code>
<dd>A C statement to output something to the assembler file to switch to section
<var>name</var> for object <var>decl</var> which is either a <code>FUNCTION_DECL</code>, a
<code>VAR_DECL</code> or <code>NULL_TREE</code>.  <var>reloc</var>
indicates whether the initial value of <var>exp</var> requires link-time
relocations.  Some target formats do not support
arbitrary sections.  Do not define this macro in such cases.

<p>At present this macro is only used to support section attributes. 
When this macro is undefined, section attributes are disabled.

<br><dt><code>OBJC_PROLOGUE</code>
<dd>A C statement to output any assembler statements which are required to
precede any Objective C object definitions or message sending.  The
statement is executed only when compiling an Objective C program.

<h3>Output of Data</h3>

<p>This describes data output.

<dl>
<dt><code>ASM_OUTPUT_LONG_DOUBLE (<var>stream</var>, <var>value</var>)</code>
<dt><code>ASM_OUTPUT_DOUBLE (<var>stream</var>, <var>value</var>)</code>
<dt><code>ASM_OUTPUT_FLOAT (<var>stream</var>, <var>value</var>)</code>
<dt><code>ASM_OUTPUT_THREE_QUARTER_FLOAT (<var>stream</var>, <var>value</var>)</code>
<dt><code>ASM_OUTPUT_SHORT_FLOAT (<var>stream</var>, <var>value</var>)</code>
<dt><code>ASM_OUTPUT_BYTE_FLOAT (<var>stream</var>, <var>value</var>)</code>
<dd>A C statement to output to the stdio stream <var>stream</var> an assembler
instruction to assemble a floating-point constant of <code>TFmode</code>,
<code>DFmode</code>, <code>SFmode</code>, <code>TQFmode</code>, <code>HFmode</code>, or
<code>QFmode</code>, respectively, whose value is <var>value</var>.  <var>value</var>
will be a C expression of type <code>REAL_VALUE_TYPE</code>.  Macros such as
<code>REAL_VALUE_TO_TARGET_DOUBLE</code> are useful for writing these
definitions.

<br><dt><code>ASM_OUTPUT_QUADRUPLE_INT (<var>stream</var>, <var>exp</var>)</code>
<dt><code>ASM_OUTPUT_DOUBLE_INT (<var>stream</var>, <var>exp</var>)</code>
<dt><code>ASM_OUTPUT_INT (<var>stream</var>, <var>exp</var>)</code>
<dt><code>ASM_OUTPUT_SHORT (<var>stream</var>, <var>exp</var>)</code>
<dt><code>ASM_OUTPUT_CHAR (<var>stream</var>, <var>exp</var>)</code>
<dd>A C statement to output to the stdio stream <var>stream</var> an assembler
instruction to assemble an integer of 16, 8, 4, 2 or 1 bytes,
respectively, whose value is <var>value</var>.  The argument <var>exp</var> will
be an RTL expression which represents a constant value.  Use
<code>output_addr_const (<var>stream</var>, <var>exp</var>)</code> to output this value
as an assembler expression.

<p>For sizes larger than <code>UNITS_PER_WORD</code>, if the action of a macro
would be identical to repeatedly calling the macro corresponding to
a size of <code>UNITS_PER_WORD</code>, once for each word, you need not define
the macro.

<br><dt><code>ASM_OUTPUT_BYTE (<var>stream</var>, <var>value</var>)</code>
<dd>A C statement to output to the stdio stream <var>stream</var> an assembler
instruction to assemble a single byte containing the number <var>value</var>.

<br><dt><code>ASM_BYTE_OP</code>
<dd>A C string constant giving the pseudo-op to use for a sequence of
single-byte constants.  If this macro is not defined, the default is
<code>"byte"</code>.

<br><dt><code>ASM_OUTPUT_ASCII (<var>stream</var>, <var>ptr</var>, <var>len</var>)</code>
<dd>A C statement to output to the stdio stream <var>stream</var> an assembler
instruction to assemble a string constant containing the <var>len</var>
bytes at <var>ptr</var>.  <var>ptr</var> will be a C expression of type
<code>char *</code> and <var>len</var> a C expression of type <code>int</code>.

<p>If the assembler has a <code>.ascii</code> pseudo-op as found in the
Berkeley Unix assembler, do not define the macro
<code>ASM_OUTPUT_ASCII</code>.

<br><dt><code>CONSTANT_POOL_BEFORE_FUNCTION</code>
<dd>You may define this macro as a C expression.  You should define the
expression to have a non-zero value if GNU CC should output the constant
pool for a function before the code for the function, or a zero value if
GNU CC should output the constant pool after the function.  If you do
not define this macro, the usual case, GNU CC will output the constant
pool before the function.

<br><dt><code>ASM_OUTPUT_POOL_PROLOGUE (<var>file</var> <var>funname</var> <var>fundecl</var> <var>size</var>)</code>
<dd>A C statement to output assembler commands to define the start of the
constant pool for a function.  <var>funname</var> is a string giving
the name of the function.  Should the return type of the function
be required, it can be obtained via <var>fundecl</var>.  <var>size</var>
is the size, in bytes, of the constant pool that will be written
immediately after this call.

<p>If no constant-pool prefix is required, the usual case, this macro need
not be defined.

<br><dt><code>ASM_OUTPUT_SPECIAL_POOL_ENTRY (<var>file</var>, <var>x</var>, <var>mode</var>, <var>align</var>, <var>labelno</var>, <var>jumpto</var>)</code>
<dd>A C statement (with or without semicolon) to output a constant in the
constant pool, if it needs special treatment.  (This macro need not do
anything for RTL expressions that can be output normally.)

<p>The argument <var>file</var> is the standard I/O stream to output the
assembler code on.  <var>x</var> is the RTL expression for the constant to
output, and <var>mode</var> is the machine mode (in case <var>x</var> is a
<code>const_int</code>).  <var>align</var> is the required alignment for the value
<var>x</var>; you should output an assembler directive to force this much
alignment.

<p>The argument <var>labelno</var> is a number to use in an internal label for
the address of this pool entry.  The definition of this macro is
responsible for outputting the label definition at the proper place. 
Here is how to do this:

<pre>ASM_OUTPUT_INTERNAL_LABEL (<var>file</var>, "LC", <var>labelno</var>);
</pre>

<p>When you output a pool entry specially, you should end with a
<code>goto</code> to the label <var>jumpto</var>.  This will prevent the same pool
entry from being output a second time in the usual manner.

<p>You need not define this macro if it would do nothing.

<br><dt><code>CONSTANT_AFTER_FUNCTION_P (<var>exp</var>)</code>
<dd>Define this macro as a C expression which is nonzero if the constant
<var>exp</var>, of type <code>tree</code>, should be output after the code for a
function.  The compiler will normally output all constants before the
function; you need not define this macro if this is OK.

<br><dt><code>ASM_OUTPUT_POOL_EPILOGUE (<var>file</var> <var>funname</var> <var>fundecl</var> <var>size</var>)</code>
<dd>A C statement to output assembler commands to at the end of the constant
pool for a function.  <var>funname</var> is a string giving the name of the
function.  Should the return type of the function be required, you can
obtain it via <var>fundecl</var>.  <var>size</var> is the size, in bytes, of the
constant pool that GNU CC wrote immediately before this call.

<p>If no constant-pool epilogue is required, the usual case, you need not
define this macro.

<br><dt><code>IS_ASM_LOGICAL_LINE_SEPARATOR (<var>C</var>)</code>
<dd>Define this macro as a C expression which is nonzero if <var>C</var> is
used as a logical line separator by the assembler.

<p>If you do not define this macro, the default is that only
the character <code>;</code> is treated as a logical line separator.

<br><dt><code>ASM_OPEN_PAREN</code>
<dt><code>ASM_CLOSE_PAREN</code>
<dd>These macros are defined as C string constant, describing the syntax
in the assembler for grouping arithmetic expressions.  The following
definitions are correct for most assemblers:

<pre>#define ASM_OPEN_PAREN "("
#define ASM_CLOSE_PAREN ")"
</pre>
</dl>

<p>These macros are provided by <code>real.h</code> for writing the definitions
of <code>ASM_OUTPUT_DOUBLE</code> and the like:

<dl>
<dt><code>REAL_VALUE_TO_TARGET_SINGLE (<var>x</var>, <var>l</var>)</code>
<dt><code>REAL_VALUE_TO_TARGET_DOUBLE (<var>x</var>, <var>l</var>)</code>
<dt><code>REAL_VALUE_TO_TARGET_LONG_DOUBLE (<var>x</var>, <var>l</var>)</code>
<dd>These translate <var>x</var>, of type <code>REAL_VALUE_TYPE</code>, to the target's
floating point representation, and store its bit pattern in the array of
<code>long int</code> whose address is <var>l</var>.  The number of elements in the
output array is determined by the size of the desired target floating
point data type: 32 bits of it go in each <code>long int</code> array
element.  Each array element holds 32 bits of the result, even if
<code>long int</code> is wider than 32 bits on the host machine.

<p>The array element values are designed so that you can print them out
using <code>fprintf</code> in the order they should appear in the target
machine's memory.

<br><dt><code>REAL_VALUE_TO_DECIMAL (<var>x</var>, <var>format</var>, <var>string</var>)</code>
<dd>This macro converts <var>x</var>, of type <code>REAL_VALUE_TYPE</code>, to a
decimal number and stores it as a string into <var>string</var>. 
You must pass, as <var>string</var>, the address of a long enough block
of space to hold the result.

<p>The argument <var>format</var> is a <code>printf</code>-specification that serves
as a suggestion for how to format the output string.

<h3>Output of Uninitialized Variables</h3>

<p>Each of the macros in this section is used to do the whole job of
outputting a single uninitialized variable.

<dl>
<dt><code>ASM_OUTPUT_COMMON (<var>stream</var>, <var>name</var>, <var>size</var>, <var>rounded</var>)</code>
<dd>A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream
<var>stream</var> the assembler definition of a common-label named
<var>name</var> whose size is <var>size</var> bytes.  The variable <var>rounded</var>
is the size rounded up to whatever alignment the caller wants.

<p>Use the expression <code>assemble_name (<var>stream</var>, <var>name</var>)</code> to
output the name itself; before and after that, output the additional
assembler syntax for defining the name, and a newline.

<p>This macro controls how the assembler definitions of uninitialized
common global variables are output.

<br><dt><code>ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGNED_COMMON (<var>stream</var>, <var>name</var>, <var>size</var>, <var>alignment</var>)</code>
<dd>Like <code>ASM_OUTPUT_COMMON</code> except takes the required alignment as a
separate, explicit argument.  If you define this macro, it is used in
place of <code>ASM_OUTPUT_COMMON</code>, and gives you more flexibility in
handling the required alignment of the variable.  The alignment is specified
as the number of bits.

<br><dt><code>ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGNED_DECL_COMMON (<var>stream</var>, <var>decl</var>, <var>name</var>, <var>size</var>, <var>alignment</var>)</code>
<dd>Like <code>ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGNED_COMMON</code> except that <var>decl</var> of the
variable to be output, if there is one, or <code>NULL_TREE</code> if there
is not corresponding variable.  If you define this macro, GNU CC wil use it
in place of both <code>ASM_OUTPUT_COMMON</code> and
<code>ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGNED_COMMON</code>.  Define this macro when you need to see
the variable's decl in order to chose what to output.

<br><dt><code>ASM_OUTPUT_SHARED_COMMON (<var>stream</var>, <var>name</var>, <var>size</var>, <var>rounded</var>)</code>
<dd>If defined, it is similar to <code>ASM_OUTPUT_COMMON</code>, except that it
is used when <var>name</var> is shared.  If not defined, <code>ASM_OUTPUT_COMMON</code>
will be used.

<br><dt><code>ASM_OUTPUT_BSS (<var>stream</var>, <var>decl</var>, <var>name</var>, <var>size</var>, <var>rounded</var>)</code>
<dd>A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream
<var>stream</var> the assembler definition of uninitialized global <var>decl</var> named
<var>name</var> whose size is <var>size</var> bytes.  The variable <var>rounded</var>
is the size rounded up to whatever alignment the caller wants.

<p>Try to use function <code>asm_output_bss</code> defined in <code>varasm.c</code> when
defining this macro.  If unable, use the expression
<code>assemble_name (<var>stream</var>, <var>name</var>)</code> to output the name itself;
before and after that, output the additional assembler syntax for defining
the name, and a newline.

<p>This macro controls how the assembler definitions of uninitialized global
variables are output.  This macro exists to properly support languages like
<code>c++</code> which do not have <code>common</code> data.  However, this macro currently
is not defined for all targets.  If this macro and
<code>ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGNED_BSS</code> are not defined then <code>ASM_OUTPUT_COMMON</code>
or <code>ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGNED_COMMON</code> or
<code>ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGNED_DECL_COMMON</code> is used.

<br><dt><code>ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGNED_BSS (<var>stream</var>, <var>decl</var>, <var>name</var>, <var>size</var>, <var>alignment</var>)</code>
<dd>Like <code>ASM_OUTPUT_BSS</code> except takes the required alignment as a
separate, explicit argument.  If you define this macro, it is used in
place of <code>ASM_OUTPUT_BSS</code>, and gives you more flexibility in
handling the required alignment of the variable.  The alignment is specified
as the number of bits.

<p>Try to use function <code>asm_output_aligned_bss</code> defined in file
<code>varasm.c</code> when defining this macro.

<br><dt><code>ASM_OUTPUT_SHARED_BSS (<var>stream</var>, <var>decl</var>, <var>name</var>, <var>size</var>, <var>rounded</var>)</code>
<dd>If defined, it is similar to <code>ASM_OUTPUT_BSS</code>, except that it
is used when <var>name</var> is shared.  If not defined, <code>ASM_OUTPUT_BSS</code>
will be used.

<br><dt><code>ASM_OUTPUT_LOCAL (<var>stream</var>, <var>name</var>, <var>size</var>, <var>rounded</var>)</code>
<dd>A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream
<var>stream</var> the assembler definition of a local-common-label named
<var>name</var> whose size is <var>size</var> bytes.  The variable <var>rounded</var>
is the size rounded up to whatever alignment the caller wants.

<p>Use the expression <code>assemble_name (<var>stream</var>, <var>name</var>)</code> to
output the name itself; before and after that, output the additional
assembler syntax for defining the name, and a newline.

<p>This macro controls how the assembler definitions of uninitialized
static variables are output.

<br><dt><code>ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGNED_LOCAL (<var>stream</var>, <var>name</var>, <var>size</var>, <var>alignment</var>)</code>
<dd>Like <code>ASM_OUTPUT_LOCAL</code> except takes the required alignment as a
separate, explicit argument.  If you define this macro, it is used in
place of <code>ASM_OUTPUT_LOCAL</code>, and gives you more flexibility in
handling the required alignment of the variable.  The alignment is specified
as the number of bits.

<br><dt><code>ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGNED_DECL_LOCAL (<var>stream</var>, <var>decl</var>, <var>name</var>, <var>size</var>, <var>alignment</var>)</code>
<dd>Like <code>ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGNED_DECL</code> except that <var>decl</var> of the
variable to be output, if there is one, or <code>NULL_TREE</code> if there
is not corresponding variable.  If you define this macro, GNU CC wil use it
in place of both <code>ASM_OUTPUT_DECL</code> and
<code>ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGNED_DECL</code>.  Define this macro when you need to see
the variable's decl in order to chose what to output.

<br><dt><code>ASM_OUTPUT_SHARED_LOCAL (<var>stream</var>, <var>name</var>, <var>size</var>, <var>rounded</var>)</code>
<dd>If defined, it is similar to <code>ASM_OUTPUT_LOCAL</code>, except that it
is used when <var>name</var> is shared.  If not defined, <code>ASM_OUTPUT_LOCAL</code>
will be used.

<h3>Output and Generation of Labels</h3>

<p>This is about outputting labels.

<dl>
<dt><code>ASM_OUTPUT_LABEL (<var>stream</var>, <var>name</var>)</code>
<dd>A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream
<var>stream</var> the assembler definition of a label named <var>name</var>. 
Use the expression <code>assemble_name (<var>stream</var>, <var>name</var>)</code> to
output the name itself; before and after that, output the additional
assembler syntax for defining the name, and a newline.

<br><dt><code>ASM_DECLARE_FUNCTION_NAME (<var>stream</var>, <var>name</var>, <var>decl</var>)</code>
<dd>A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream
<var>stream</var> any text necessary for declaring the name <var>name</var> of a
function which is being defined.  This macro is responsible for
outputting the label definition (perhaps using
<code>ASM_OUTPUT_LABEL</code>).  The argument <var>decl</var> is the
<code>FUNCTION_DECL</code> tree node representing the function.

<p>If this macro is not defined, then the function name is defined in the
usual manner as a label (by means of <code>ASM_OUTPUT_LABEL</code>).

<br><dt><code>ASM_DECLARE_FUNCTION_SIZE (<var>stream</var>, <var>name</var>, <var>decl</var>)</code>
<dd>A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream
<var>stream</var> any text necessary for declaring the size of a function
which is being defined.  The argument <var>name</var> is the name of the
function.  The argument <var>decl</var> is the <code>FUNCTION_DECL</code> tree node
representing the function.

<p>If this macro is not defined, then the function size is not defined.

<br><dt><code>ASM_DECLARE_OBJECT_NAME (<var>stream</var>, <var>name</var>, <var>decl</var>)</code>
<dd>A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream
<var>stream</var> any text necessary for declaring the name <var>name</var> of an
initialized variable which is being defined.  This macro must output the
label definition (perhaps using <code>ASM_OUTPUT_LABEL</code>).  The argument
<var>decl</var> is the <code>VAR_DECL</code> tree node representing the variable.

<p>If this macro is not defined, then the variable name is defined in the
usual manner as a label (by means of <code>ASM_OUTPUT_LABEL</code>).

<br><dt><code>ASM_FINISH_DECLARE_OBJECT (<var>stream</var>, <var>decl</var>, <var>toplevel</var>, <var>atend</var>)</code>
<dd>A C statement (sans semicolon) to finish up declaring a variable name
once the compiler has processed its initializer fully and thus has had a
chance to determine the size of an array when controlled by an
initializer.  This is used on systems where it's necessary to declare
something about the size of the object.

<p>If you don't define this macro, that is equivalent to defining it to do
nothing.

<br><dt><code>ASM_GLOBALIZE_LABEL (<var>stream</var>, <var>name</var>)</code>
<dd>A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream
<var>stream</var> some commands that will make the label <var>name</var> global;
that is, available for reference from other files.  Use the expression
<code>assemble_name (<var>stream</var>, <var>name</var>)</code> to output the name
itself; before and after that, output the additional assembler syntax
for making that name global, and a newline.

<br><dt><code>ASM_WEAKEN_LABEL</code>
<dd>A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream
<var>stream</var> some commands that will make the label <var>name</var> weak;
that is, available for reference from other files but only used if
no other definition is available.  Use the expression
<code>assemble_name (<var>stream</var>, <var>name</var>)</code> to output the name
itself; before and after that, output the additional assembler syntax
for making that name weak, and a newline.

<p>If you don't define this macro, GNU CC will not support weak
symbols and you should not define the <code>SUPPORTS_WEAK</code> macro.

<br><dt><code>SUPPORTS_WEAK</code>
<dd>A C expression which evaluates to true if the target supports weak symbols.

<p>If you don't define this macro, <code>defaults.h</code> provides a default
definition.  If <code>ASM_WEAKEN_LABEL</code> is defined, the default
definition is <code>1</code>; otherwise, it is <code>0</code>.  Define this macro if
you want to control weak symbol support with a compiler flag such as
<code>-melf</code>.

<br><dt><code>MAKE_DECL_ONE_ONLY</code>
<dd>A C statement (sans semicolon) to mark <var>decl</var> to be emitted as a
public symbol such that extra copies in multiple translation units will
be discarded by the linker.  Define this macro if your object file
format provides support for this concept, such as the <code>COMDAT</code>
section flags in the Microsoft Windows PE/COFF format, and this support
requires changes to <var>decl</var>, such as putting it in a separate section.

<br><dt><code>SUPPORTS_ONE_ONLY</code>
<dd>A C expression which evaluates to true if the target supports one-only
semantics.

<p>If you don't define this macro, <code>varasm.c</code> provides a default
definition.  If <code>MAKE_DECL_ONE_ONLY</code> is defined, the default
definition is <code>1</code>; otherwise, it is <code>0</code>.  Define this macro if
you want to control one-only symbol support with a compiler flag, or if
setting the <code>DECL_ONE_ONLY</code> flag is enough to mark a declaration to
be emitted as one-only.

<br><dt><code>ASM_OUTPUT_EXTERNAL (<var>stream</var>, <var>decl</var>, <var>name</var>)</code>
<dd>A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream
<var>stream</var> any text necessary for declaring the name of an external
symbol named <var>name</var> which is referenced in this compilation but
not defined.  The value of <var>decl</var> is the tree node for the
declaration.

<p>This macro need not be defined if it does not need to output anything. 
The GNU assembler and most Unix assemblers don't require anything.

<br><dt><code>ASM_OUTPUT_EXTERNAL_LIBCALL (<var>stream</var>, <var>symref</var>)</code>
<dd>A C statement (sans semicolon) to output on <var>stream</var> an assembler
pseudo-op to declare a library function name external.  The name of the
library function is given by <var>symref</var>, which has type <code>rtx</code> and
is a <code>symbol_ref</code>.

<p>This macro need not be defined if it does not need to output anything. 
The GNU assembler and most Unix assemblers don't require anything.

<br><dt><code>ASM_OUTPUT_LABELREF (<var>stream</var>, <var>name</var>)</code>
<dd>A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream
<var>stream</var> a reference in assembler syntax to a label named
<var>name</var>.  This should add <code>_</code> to the front of the name, if that
is customary on your operating system, as it is in most Berkeley Unix
systems.  This macro is used in <code>assemble_name</code>.

<br><dt><code>ASM_OUTPUT_INTERNAL_LABEL (<var>stream</var>, <var>prefix</var>, <var>num</var>)</code>
<dd>A C statement to output to the stdio stream <var>stream</var> a label whose
name is made from the string <var>prefix</var> and the number <var>num</var>.

<p>It is absolutely essential that these labels be distinct from the labels
used for user-level functions and variables.  Otherwise, certain programs
will have name conflicts with internal labels.

<p>It is desirable to exclude internal labels from the symbol table of the
object file.  Most assemblers have a naming convention for labels that
should be excluded; on many systems, the letter <code>L</code> at the
beginning of a label has this effect.  You should find out what
convention your system uses, and follow it.

<p>The usual definition of this macro is as follows:

<pre>fprintf (<var>stream</var>, "L%s%d:\n", <var>prefix</var>, <var>num</var>)
</pre>

<br><dt><code>ASM_GENERATE_INTERNAL_LABEL (<var>string</var>, <var>prefix</var>, <var>num</var>)</code>
<dd>A C statement to store into the string <var>string</var> a label whose name
is made from the string <var>prefix</var> and the number <var>num</var>.

<p>This string, when output subsequently by <code>assemble_name</code>, should
produce the output that <code>ASM_OUTPUT_INTERNAL_LABEL</code> would produce
with the same <var>prefix</var> and <var>num</var>.

<p>If the string begins with <code>*</code>, then <code>assemble_name</code> will
output the rest of the string unchanged.  It is often convenient for
<code>ASM_GENERATE_INTERNAL_LABEL</code> to use <code>*</code> in this way.  If the
string doesn't start with <code>*</code>, then <code>ASM_OUTPUT_LABELREF</code> gets
to output the string, and may change it.  (Of course,
<code>ASM_OUTPUT_LABELREF</code> is also part of your machine description, so
you should know what it does on your machine.)

<br><dt><code>ASM_FORMAT_PRIVATE_NAME (<var>outvar</var>, <var>name</var>, <var>number</var>)</code>
<dd>A C expression to assign to <var>outvar</var> (which is a variable of type
<code>char *</code>) a newly allocated string made from the string
<var>name</var> and the number <var>number</var>, with some suitable punctuation
added.  Use <code>alloca</code> to get space for the string.

<p>The string will be used as an argument to <code>ASM_OUTPUT_LABELREF</code> to
produce an assembler label for an internal static variable whose name is
<var>name</var>.  Therefore, the string must be such as to result in valid
assembler code.  The argument <var>number</var> is different each time this
macro is executed; it prevents conflicts between similarly-named
internal static variables in different scopes.

<p>Ideally this string should not be a valid C identifier, to prevent any
conflict with the user's own symbols.  Most assemblers allow periods
or percent signs in assembler symbols; putting at least one of these
between the name and the number will suffice.

<br><dt><code>ASM_OUTPUT_DEF (<var>stream</var>, <var>name</var>, <var>value</var>)</code>
<dd>A C statement to output to the stdio stream <var>stream</var> assembler code
which defines (equates) the symbol <var>name</var> to have the value <var>value</var>.

<p>If SET_ASM_OP is defined, a default definition is provided which is
correct for most systems.

<br><dt><code>ASM_OUTPUT_DEFINE_LABEL_DIFFERENCE_SYMBOL (<var>stream</var>, <var>symbol</var>, <var>high</var>, <var>low</var>)</code>
<dd>A C statement to output to the stdio stream <var>stream</var> assembler code
which defines (equates) the symbol <var>symbol</var> to have a value equal to
the difference of the two symbols <var>high</var> and <var>low</var>, i.e. 
<var>high</var> minus <var>low</var>.  GNU CC guarantees that the symbols <var>high</var>
and <var>low</var> are already known by the assembler so that the difference
resolves into a constant.

<p>If SET_ASM_OP is defined, a default definition is provided which is
correct for most systems.

<br><dt><code>ASM_OUTPUT_WEAK_ALIAS (<var>stream</var>, <var>name</var>, <var>value</var>)</code>
<dd>A C statement to output to the stdio stream <var>stream</var> assembler code
which defines (equates) the weak symbol <var>name</var> to have the value
<var>value</var>.

<p>Define this macro if the target only supports weak aliases; define
ASM_OUTPUT_DEF instead if possible.

<br><dt><code>OBJC_GEN_METHOD_LABEL (<var>buf</var>, <var>is_inst</var>, <var>class_name</var>, <var>cat_name</var>, <var>sel_name</var>)</code>
<dd>Define this macro to override the default assembler names used for
Objective C methods.

<p>The default name is a unique method number followed by the name of the
class (e.g. <code>_1_Foo</code>).  For methods in categories, the name of
the category is also included in the assembler name (e.g. 
<code>_1_Foo_Bar</code>).

<p>These names are safe on most systems, but make debugging difficult since
the method's selector is not present in the name.  Therefore, particular
systems define other ways of computing names.

<p><var>buf</var> is an expression of type <code>char *</code> which gives you a
buffer in which to store the name; its length is as long as
<var>class_name</var>, <var>cat_name</var> and <var>sel_name</var> put together, plus
50 characters extra.

<p>The argument <var>is_inst</var> specifies whether the method is an instance
method or a class method; <var>class_name</var> is the name of the class;
<var>cat_name</var> is the name of the category (or NULL if the method is not
in a category); and <var>sel_name</var> is the name of the selector.

<p>On systems where the assembler can handle quoted names, you can use this
macro to provide more human-readable names.

<h3>How Initialization Functions Are Handled</h3>

<p>The compiled code for certain languages includes <dfn>constructors</dfn>
(also called <dfn>initialization routines</dfn>)--functions to initialize
data in the program when the program is started.  These functions need
to be called before the program is "started"--that is to say, before
<code>main</code> is called.

<p>Compiling some languages generates <dfn>destructors</dfn> (also called
<dfn>termination routines</dfn>) that should be called when the program
terminates.

<p>To make the initialization and termination functions work, the compiler
must output something in the assembler code to cause those functions to
be called at the appropriate time.  When you port the compiler to a new
system, you need to specify how to do this.

<p>There are two major ways that GCC currently supports the execution of
initialization and termination functions.  Each way has two variants. 
Much of the structure is common to all four variations.

<p>The linker must build two lists of these functions--a list of
initialization functions, called <code>__CTOR_LIST__</code>, and a list of
termination functions, called <code>__DTOR_LIST__</code>.

<p>Each list always begins with an ignored function pointer (which may hold
0, -1, or a count of the function pointers after it, depending on
the environment).  This is followed by a series of zero or more function
pointers to constructors (or destructors), followed by a function
pointer containing zero.

<p>Depending on the operating system and its executable file format, either
<code>crtstuff.c</code> or <code>libgcc2.c</code> traverses these lists at startup
time and exit time.  Constructors are called in reverse order of the
list; destructors in forward order.

<p>The best way to handle static constructors works only for object file
formats which provide arbitrarily-named sections.  A section is set
aside for a list of constructors, and another for a list of destructors. 
Traditionally these are called <code>.ctors</code> and <code>.dtors</code>.  Each
object file that defines an initialization function also puts a word in
the constructor section to point to that function.  The linker
accumulates all these words into one contiguous <code>.ctors</code> section. 
Termination functions are handled similarly.

<p>To use this method, you need appropriate definitions of the macros
<code>ASM_OUTPUT_CONSTRUCTOR</code> and <code>ASM_OUTPUT_DESTRUCTOR</code>.  Usually
you can get them by including <code>svr4.h</code>.

<p>When arbitrary sections are available, there are two variants, depending
upon how the code in <code>crtstuff.c</code> is called.  On systems that
support an <dfn>init</dfn> section which is executed at program startup,
parts of <code>crtstuff.c</code> are compiled into that section.  The
program is linked by the <code>gcc</code> driver like this:

<pre>ld -o <var>output_file</var> crtbegin.o <small>...</small> crtend.o -lgcc
</pre>

<p>The head of a function (<code>__do_global_ctors</code>) appears in the init
section of <code>crtbegin.o</code>; the remainder of the function appears in
the init section of <code>crtend.o</code>.  The linker will pull these two
parts of the section together, making a whole function.  If any of the
user's object files linked into the middle of it contribute code, then that
code will be executed as part of the body of <code>__do_global_ctors</code>.

<p>To use this variant, you must define the <code>INIT_SECTION_ASM_OP</code>
macro properly.

<p>If no init section is available, do not define
<code>INIT_SECTION_ASM_OP</code>.  Then <code>__do_global_ctors</code> is built into
the text section like all other functions, and resides in
<code>libgcc.a</code>.  When GCC compiles any function called <code>main</code>, it
inserts a procedure call to <code>__main</code> as the first executable code
after the function prologue.  The <code>__main</code> function, also defined
in <code>libgcc2.c</code>, simply calls <code>__do_global_ctors</code>.

<p>In file formats that don't support arbitrary sections, there are again
two variants.  In the simplest variant, the GNU linker (GNU <code>ld</code>)
and an `a.out' format must be used.  In this case,
<code>ASM_OUTPUT_CONSTRUCTOR</code> is defined to produce a <code>.stabs</code>
entry of type <code>N_SETT</code>, referencing the name <code>__CTOR_LIST__</code>,
and with the address of the void function containing the initialization
code as its value.  The GNU linker recognizes this as a request to add
the value to a "set"; the values are accumulated, and are eventually
placed in the executable as a vector in the format described above, with
a leading (ignored) count and a trailing zero element. 
<code>ASM_OUTPUT_DESTRUCTOR</code> is handled similarly.  Since no init
section is available, the absence of <code>INIT_SECTION_ASM_OP</code> causes
the compilation of <code>main</code> to call <code>__main</code> as above, starting
the initialization process.

<p>The last variant uses neither arbitrary sections nor the GNU linker. 
This is preferable when you want to do dynamic linking and when using
file formats which the GNU linker does not support, such as `ECOFF'.  In
this case, <code>ASM_OUTPUT_CONSTRUCTOR</code> does not produce an
<code>N_SETT</code> symbol; initialization and termination functions are
recognized simply by their names.  This requires an extra program in the
linkage step, called <code>collect2</code>.  This program pretends to be the
linker, for use with GNU CC; it does its job by running the ordinary
linker, but also arranges to include the vectors of initialization and
termination functions.  These functions are called via <code>__main</code> as
described above.

<p>Choosing among these configuration options has been simplified by a set
of operating-system-dependent files in the <code>config</code> subdirectory. 
These files define all of the relevant parameters.  Usually it is
sufficient to include one into your specific machine-dependent
configuration file.  These files are:

<dl>
<dt><code>aoutos.h</code>
<dd>For operating systems using the `a.out' format.

<br><dt><code>next.h</code>
<dd>For operating systems using the `MachO' format.

<br><dt><code>svr3.h</code>
<dd>For System V Release 3 and similar systems using `COFF' format.

<br><dt><code>svr4.h</code>
<dd>For System V Release 4 and similar systems using `ELF' format.

<br><dt><code>vms.h</code>
<dd>For the VMS operating system. 
</dl>

<p>The following section describes the specific macros that control and
customize the handling of initialization and termination functions.

<h3>Macros Controlling Initialization Routines</h3>

<p>Here are the macros that control how the compiler handles initialization
and termination functions:

<dl>
<dt><code>INIT_SECTION_ASM_OP</code>
<dd>If defined, a C string constant for the assembler operation to identify
the following data as initialization code.  If not defined, GNU CC will
assume such a section does not exist.  When you are using special
sections for initialization and termination functions, this macro also
controls how <code>crtstuff.c</code> and <code>libgcc2.c</code> arrange to run the
initialization functions.

<br><dt><code>HAS_INIT_SECTION</code>
<dd>If defined, <code>main</code> will not call <code>__main</code> as described above. 
This macro should be defined for systems that control the contents of the
init section on a symbol-by-symbol basis, such as OSF/1, and should not
be defined explicitly for systems that support
<code>INIT_SECTION_ASM_OP</code>.

<br><dt><code>LD_INIT_SWITCH</code>
<dd>If defined, a C string constant for a switch that tells the linker that
the following symbol is an initialization routine.

<br><dt><code>LD_FINI_SWITCH</code>
<dd>If defined, a C string constant for a switch that tells the linker that
the following symbol is a finalization routine.

<br><dt><code>INVOKE__main</code>
<dd>If defined, <code>main</code> will call <code>__main</code> despite the presence of
<code>INIT_SECTION_ASM_OP</code>.  This macro should be defined for systems
where the init section is not actually run automatically, but is still
useful for collecting the lists of constructors and destructors.

<br><dt><code>ASM_OUTPUT_CONSTRUCTOR (<var>stream</var>, <var>name</var>)</code>
<dd>Define this macro as a C statement to output on the stream <var>stream</var>
the assembler code to arrange to call the function named <var>name</var> at
initialization time.

<p>Assume that <var>name</var> is the name of a C function generated
automatically by the compiler.  This function takes no arguments.  Use
the function <code>assemble_name</code> to output the name <var>name</var>; this
performs any system-specific syntactic transformations such as adding an
underscore.

<p>If you don't define this macro, nothing special is output to arrange to
call the function.  This is correct when the function will be called in
some other manner--for example, by means of the <code>collect2</code> program,
which looks through the symbol table to find these functions by their
names.

<br><dt><code>ASM_OUTPUT_DESTRUCTOR (<var>stream</var>, <var>name</var>)</code>
<dd>This is like <code>ASM_OUTPUT_CONSTRUCTOR</code> but used for termination
functions rather than initialization functions.

<p>When <code>ASM_OUTPUT_CONSTRUCTOR</code> and <code>ASM_OUTPUT_DESTRUCTOR</code> are
defined, the initializaiton routine generated for the generated object
file will have static linkage. 
</dl>

<p>If your system uses <code>collect2</code> as the means of processing
constructors, then that program normally uses <code>nm</code> to scan an
object file for constructor functions to be called.  On such systems you
must not define <code>ASM_OUTPUT_CONSTRUCTOR</code> and <code>ASM_OUTPUT_DESTRUCTOR</code>
as the object file's initialization routine must have global scope.

<p>On certain kinds of systems, you can define these macros to make
<code>collect2</code> work faster (and, in some cases, make it work at all):

<dl>
<dt><code>OBJECT_FORMAT_COFF</code>
<dd>Define this macro if the system uses COFF (Common Object File Format)
object files, so that <code>collect2</code> can assume this format and scan
object files directly for dynamic constructor/destructor functions.

<br><dt><code>OBJECT_FORMAT_ROSE</code>
<dd>Define this macro if the system uses ROSE format object files, so that
<code>collect2</code> can assume this format and scan object files directly
for dynamic constructor/destructor functions.

<p>These macros are effective only in a native compiler; <code>collect2</code> as
part of a cross compiler always uses <code>nm</code> for the target machine.

<br><dt><code>REAL_NM_FILE_NAME</code>
<dd>Define this macro as a C string constant containing the file name to use
to execute <code>nm</code>.  The default is to search the path normally for
<code>nm</code>.

<p>If your system supports shared libraries and has a program to list the
dynamic dependencies of a given library or executable, you can define
these macros to enable support for running initialization and
termination functions in shared libraries:

<br><dt><code>LDD_SUFFIX</code>
<dd>Define this macro to a C string constant containing the name of the
program which lists dynamic dependencies, like <code>"ldd"</code> under SunOS 4.

<br><dt><code>PARSE_LDD_OUTPUT (<var>PTR</var>)</code>
<dd>Define this macro to be C code that extracts filenames from the output
of the program denoted by <code>LDD_SUFFIX</code>.  <var>PTR</var> is a variable
of type <code>char *</code> that points to the beginning of a line of output
from <code>LDD_SUFFIX</code>.  If the line lists a dynamic dependency, the
code must advance <var>PTR</var> to the beginning of the filename on that
line.  Otherwise, it must set <var>PTR</var> to <code>NULL</code>.

<h3>Output of Assembler Instructions</h3>

<p>This describes assembler instruction output.

<dl>
<dt><code>REGISTER_NAMES</code>
<dd>A C initializer containing the assembler's names for the machine
registers, each one as a C string constant.  This is what translates
register numbers in the compiler into assembler language.

<br><dt><code>ADDITIONAL_REGISTER_NAMES</code>
<dd>If defined, a C initializer for an array of structures containing a name
and a register number.  This macro defines additional names for hard
registers, thus allowing the <code>asm</code> option in declarations to refer
to registers using alternate names.

<br><dt><code>ASM_OUTPUT_OPCODE (<var>stream</var>, <var>ptr</var>)</code>
<dd>Define this macro if you are using an unusual assembler that
requires different names for the machine instructions.

<p>The definition is a C statement or statements which output an
assembler instruction opcode to the stdio stream <var>stream</var>.  The
macro-operand <var>ptr</var> is a variable of type <code>char *</code> which
points to the opcode name in its "internal" form--the form that is
written in the machine description.  The definition should output the
opcode name to <var>stream</var>, performing any translation you desire, and
increment the variable <var>ptr</var> to point at the end of the opcode
so that it will not be output twice.

<p>In fact, your macro definition may process less than the entire opcode
name, or more than the opcode name; but if you want to process text
that includes <code>%</code>-sequences to substitute operands, you must take
care of the substitution yourself.  Just be sure to increment
<var>ptr</var> over whatever text should not be output normally.

<p>If you need to look at the operand values, they can be found as the
elements of <code>recog_operand</code>.

<p>If the macro definition does nothing, the instruction is output
in the usual way.

<br><dt><code>FINAL_PRESCAN_INSN (<var>insn</var>, <var>opvec</var>, <var>noperands</var>)</code>
<dd>If defined, a C statement to be executed just prior to the output of
assembler code for <var>insn</var>, to modify the extracted operands so
they will be output differently.

<p>Here the argument <var>opvec</var> is the vector containing the operands
extracted from <var>insn</var>, and <var>noperands</var> is the number of
elements of the vector which contain meaningful data for this insn. 
The contents of this vector are what will be used to convert the insn
template into assembler code, so you can change the assembler output
by changing the contents of the vector.

<p>This macro is useful when various assembler syntaxes share a single
file of instruction patterns; by defining this macro differently, you
can cause a large class of instructions to be output differently (such
as with rearranged operands).  Naturally, variations in assembler
syntax affecting individual insn patterns ought to be handled by
writing conditional output routines in those patterns.

<p>If this macro is not defined, it is equivalent to a null statement.

<br><dt><code>FINAL_PRESCAN_LABEL</code>
<dd>If defined, <code>FINAL_PRESCAN_INSN</code> will be called on each
<code>CODE_LABEL</code>.  In that case, <var>opvec</var> will be a null pointer and
<var>noperands</var> will be zero.

<br><dt><code>PRINT_OPERAND (<var>stream</var>, <var>x</var>, <var>code</var>)</code>
<dd>A C compound statement to output to stdio stream <var>stream</var> the
assembler syntax for an instruction operand <var>x</var>.  <var>x</var> is an
RTL expression.

<p><var>code</var> is a value that can be used to specify one of several ways
of printing the operand.  It is used when identical operands must be
printed differently depending on the context.  <var>code</var> comes from
the <code>%</code> specification that was used to request printing of the
operand.  If the specification was just <code>%<var>digit</var></code> then
<var>code</var> is 0; if the specification was <code>%<var>ltr</var>
<var>digit</var></code> then <var>code</var> is the ASCII code for <var>ltr</var>.

<p>If <var>x</var> is a register, this macro should print the register's name. 
The names can be found in an array <code>reg_names</code> whose type is
<code>char *[]</code>.  <code>reg_names</code> is initialized from
<code>REGISTER_NAMES</code>.

<p>When the machine description has a specification <code>%<var>punct</var></code>
(a <code>%</code> followed by a punctuation character), this macro is called
with a null pointer for <var>x</var> and the punctuation character for
<var>code</var>.

<br><dt><code>PRINT_OPERAND_PUNCT_VALID_P (<var>code</var>)</code>
<dd>A C expression which evaluates to true if <var>code</var> is a valid
punctuation character for use in the <code>PRINT_OPERAND</code> macro.  If
<code>PRINT_OPERAND_PUNCT_VALID_P</code> is not defined, it means that no
punctuation characters (except for the standard one, <code>%</code>) are used
in this way.

<br><dt><code>PRINT_OPERAND_ADDRESS (<var>stream</var>, <var>x</var>)</code>
<dd>A C compound statement to output to stdio stream <var>stream</var> the
assembler syntax for an instruction operand that is a memory reference
whose address is <var>x</var>.  <var>x</var> is an RTL expression.

<p>On some machines, the syntax for a symbolic address depends on the
section that the address refers to.  On these machines, define the macro
<code>ENCODE_SECTION_INFO</code> to store the information into the
<code>symbol_ref</code>, and then check for it here.  See <a href="#Assembler%20Format">Assembler Format</a>.

<br><dt><code>DBR_OUTPUT_SEQEND(<var>file</var>)</code>
<dd>A C statement, to be executed after all slot-filler instructions have
been output.  If necessary, call <code>dbr_sequence_length</code> to
determine the number of slots filled in a sequence (zero if not
currently outputting a sequence), to decide how many no-ops to output,
or whatever.

<p>Don't define this macro if it has nothing to do, but it is helpful in
reading assembly output if the extent of the delay sequence is made
explicit (e.g. with white space).

<p>Note that output routines for instructions with delay slots must be
prepared to deal with not being output as part of a sequence (i.e. 
when the scheduling pass is not run, or when no slot fillers could be
found.)  The variable <code>final_sequence</code> is null when not
processing a sequence, otherwise it contains the <code>sequence</code> rtx
being output.

<br><dt><code>REGISTER_PREFIX</code>
<dt><code>LOCAL_LABEL_PREFIX</code>
<dt><code>USER_LABEL_PREFIX</code>
<dt><code>IMMEDIATE_PREFIX</code>
<dd>If defined, C string expressions to be used for the <code>%R</code>, <code>%L</code>,
<code>%U</code>, and <code>%I</code> options of <code>asm_fprintf</code> (see
<code>final.c</code>).  These are useful when a single <code>md</code> file must
support multiple assembler formats.  In that case, the various <code>tm.h</code>
files can define these macros differently.

<br><dt><code>ASSEMBLER_DIALECT</code>
<dd>If your target supports multiple dialects of assembler language (such as
different opcodes), define this macro as a C expression that gives the
numeric index of the assembler language dialect to use, with zero as the
first variant.

<p>If this macro is defined, you may use constructs of the form
<code>{option0|option1|option2<small>...</small>}</code> in the output
templates of patterns (see <a href="#Output%20Template">Output Template</a>) or in the first argument
of <code>asm_fprintf</code>.  This construct outputs <code>option0</code>,
<code>option1</code> or <code>option2</code>, etc., if the value of
<code>ASSEMBLER_DIALECT</code> is zero, one or two, etc.  Any special
characters within these strings retain their usual meaning.

<p>If you do not define this macro, the characters <code>{</code>, <code>|</code> and
<code>}</code> do not have any special meaning when used in templates or
operands to <code>asm_fprintf</code>.

<p>Define the macros <code>REGISTER_PREFIX</code>, <code>LOCAL_LABEL_PREFIX</code>,
<code>USER_LABEL_PREFIX</code> and <code>IMMEDIATE_PREFIX</code> if you can express
the variations in assembler language syntax with that mechanism.  Define
<code>ASSEMBLER_DIALECT</code> and use the <code>{option0|option1}</code> syntax
if the syntax variant are larger and involve such things as different
opcodes or operand order.

<br><dt><code>ASM_OUTPUT_REG_PUSH (<var>stream</var>, <var>regno</var>)</code>
<dd>A C expression to output to <var>stream</var> some assembler code
which will push hard register number <var>regno</var> onto the stack. 
The code need not be optimal, since this macro is used only when
profiling.

<br><dt><code>ASM_OUTPUT_REG_POP (<var>stream</var>, <var>regno</var>)</code>
<dd>A C expression to output to <var>stream</var> some assembler code
which will pop hard register number <var>regno</var> off of the stack. 
The code need not be optimal, since this macro is used only when
profiling.

<h3>Output of Dispatch Tables</h3>

<p>This concerns dispatch tables.

<dl>
<dt><code>ASM_OUTPUT_ADDR_DIFF_ELT (<var>stream</var>, <var>body</var>, <var>value</var>, <var>rel</var>)</code>
<dd>A C statement to output to the stdio stream <var>stream</var> an assembler
pseudo-instruction to generate a difference between two labels. 
<var>value</var> and <var>rel</var> are the numbers of two internal labels.  The
definitions of these labels are output using
<code>ASM_OUTPUT_INTERNAL_LABEL</code>, and they must be printed in the same
way here.  For example,

<pre>fprintf (<var>stream</var>, "\t.word L%d-L%d\n",
         <var>value</var>, <var>rel</var>)
</pre>

<p>You must provide this macro on machines where the addresses in a
dispatch table are relative to the table's own address.  If defined, GNU
CC will also use this macro on all machines when producing PIC. 
<var>body</var> is the body of the ADDR_DIFF_VEC; it is provided so that the
mode and flags can be read.

<br><dt><code>ASM_OUTPUT_ADDR_VEC_ELT (<var>stream</var>, <var>value</var>)</code>
<dd>This macro should be provided on machines where the addresses
in a dispatch table are absolute.

<p>The definition should be a C statement to output to the stdio stream
<var>stream</var> an assembler pseudo-instruction to generate a reference to
a label.  <var>value</var> is the number of an internal label whose
definition is output using <code>ASM_OUTPUT_INTERNAL_LABEL</code>. 
For example,

<pre>fprintf (<var>stream</var>, "\t.word L%d\n", <var>value</var>)
</pre>

<br><dt><code>ASM_OUTPUT_CASE_LABEL (<var>stream</var>, <var>prefix</var>, <var>num</var>, <var>table</var>)</code>
<dd>Define this if the label before a jump-table needs to be output
specially.  The first three arguments are the same as for
<code>ASM_OUTPUT_INTERNAL_LABEL</code>; the fourth argument is the
jump-table which follows (a <code>jump_insn</code> containing an
<code>addr_vec</code> or <code>addr_diff_vec</code>).

<p>This feature is used on system V to output a <code>swbeg</code> statement
for the table.

<p>If this macro is not defined, these labels are output with
<code>ASM_OUTPUT_INTERNAL_LABEL</code>.

<br><dt><code>ASM_OUTPUT_CASE_END (<var>stream</var>, <var>num</var>, <var>table</var>)</code>
<dd>Define this if something special must be output at the end of a
jump-table.  The definition should be a C statement to be executed
after the assembler code for the table is written.  It should write
the appropriate code to stdio stream <var>stream</var>.  The argument
<var>table</var> is the jump-table insn, and <var>num</var> is the label-number
of the preceding label.

<p>If this macro is not defined, nothing special is output at the end of
the jump-table.

<h3>Assembler Commands for Exception Regions</h3>

<p>This describes commands marking the start and the end of an exception
region.

<dl>
<dt><code>ASM_OUTPUT_EH_REGION_BEG ()</code>
<dd>A C expression to output text to mark the start of an exception region.

<p>This macro need not be defined on most platforms.

<br><dt><code>ASM_OUTPUT_EH_REGION_END ()</code>
<dd>A C expression to output text to mark the end of an exception region.

<p>This macro need not be defined on most platforms.

<br><dt><code>EXCEPTION_SECTION ()</code>
<dd>A C expression to switch to the section in which the main
exception table is to be placed (see <a href="#Sections">Sections</a>).  The default is a
section named <code>.gcc_except_table</code> on machines that support named
sections via <code>ASM_OUTPUT_SECTION_NAME</code>, otherwise if <code>-fpic</code>
or <code>-fPIC</code> is in effect, the <code>data_section</code>, otherwise the
<code>readonly_data_section</code>.

<br><dt><code>EH_FRAME_SECTION_ASM_OP</code>
<dd>If defined, a C string constant for the assembler operation to switch to
the section for exception handling frame unwind information.  If not
defined, GNU CC will provide a default definition if the target supports
named sections.  <code>crtstuff.c</code> uses this macro to switch to the
appropriate section.

<p>You should define this symbol if your target supports DWARF 2 frame
unwind information and the default definition does not work.

<br><dt><code>OMIT_EH_TABLE ()</code>
<dd>A C expression that is nonzero if the normal exception table output
should be omitted.

<p>This macro need not be defined on most platforms.

<br><dt><code>EH_TABLE_LOOKUP ()</code>
<dd>Alternate runtime support for looking up an exception at runtime and
finding the associated handler, if the default method won't work.

<p>This macro need not be defined on most platforms.

<br><dt><code>DOESNT_NEED_UNWINDER</code>
<dd>A C expression that decides whether or not the current function needs to
have a function unwinder generated for it.  See the file <code>except.c</code>
for details on when to define this, and how.

<br><dt><code>MASK_RETURN_ADDR</code>
<dd>An rtx used to mask the return address found via RETURN_ADDR_RTX, so
that it does not contain any extraneous set bits in it.

<br><dt><code>DWARF2_UNWIND_INFO</code>
<dd>Define this macro to 0 if your target supports DWARF 2 frame unwind
information, but it does not yet work with exception handling. 
Otherwise, if your target supports this information (if it defines
<code>INCOMING_RETURN_ADDR_RTX</code> and either <code>UNALIGNED_INT_ASM_OP</code>
or <code>OBJECT_FORMAT_ELF</code>), GCC will provide a default definition of
1.

<p>If this macro is defined to 1, the DWARF 2 unwinder will be the default
exception handling mechanism; otherwise, setjmp/longjmp will be used by
default.

<p>If this macro is defined to anything, the DWARF 2 unwinder will be used
instead of inline unwinders and __unwind_function in the non-setjmp case.

<h3>Assembler Commands for Alignment</h3>

<p>This describes commands for alignment.

<dl>
<dt><code>LABEL_ALIGN_AFTER_BARRIER (<var>label</var>)</code>
<dd>The alignment (log base 2) to put in front of <var>label</var>, which follows
a BARRIER.

<p>This macro need not be defined if you don't want any special alignment
to be done at such a time.  Most machine descriptions do not currently
define the macro.

<br><dt><code>LOOP_ALIGN (<var>label</var>)</code>
<dd>The alignment (log base 2) to put in front of <var>label</var>, which follows
a NOTE_INSN_LOOP_BEG note.

<p>This macro need not be defined if you don't want any special alignment
to be done at such a time.  Most machine descriptions do not currently
define the macro.

<br><dt><code>LABEL_ALIGN (<var>label</var>)</code>
<dd>The alignment (log base 2) to put in front of <var>label</var>. 
If LABEL_ALIGN_AFTER_BARRIER / LOOP_ALIGN specify a different alignment,
the maximum of the specified values is used.

<br><dt><code>ASM_OUTPUT_SKIP (<var>stream</var>, <var>nbytes</var>)</code>
<dd>A C statement to output to the stdio stream <var>stream</var> an assembler
instruction to advance the location counter by <var>nbytes</var> bytes. 
Those bytes should be zero when loaded.  <var>nbytes</var> will be a C
expression of type <code>int</code>.

<br><dt><code>ASM_NO_SKIP_IN_TEXT</code>
<dd>Define this macro if <code>ASM_OUTPUT_SKIP</code> should not be used in the
text section because it fails to put zeros in the bytes that are skipped. 
This is true on many Unix systems, where the pseudo-op to skip bytes
produces no-op instructions rather than zeros when used in the text
section.

<br><dt><code>ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGN (<var>stream</var>, <var>power</var>)</code>
<dd>A C statement to output to the stdio stream <var>stream</var> an assembler
command to advance the location counter to a multiple of 2 to the
<var>power</var> bytes.  <var>power</var> will be a C expression of type <code>int</code>.

<br><dt><code>ASM_OUTPUT_MAX_SKIP_ALIGN (<var>stream</var>, <var>power</var>, <var>max_skip</var>)</code>
<dd>A C statement to output to the stdio stream <var>stream</var> an assembler
command to advance the location counter to a multiple of 2 to the
<var>power</var> bytes, but only if <var>max_skip</var> or fewer bytes are needed to
satisfy the alignment request.  <var>power</var> and <var>max_skip</var> will be
a C expression of type <code>int</code>.

<h3>Macros Affecting All Debugging Formats</h3>

<p>These macros affect all debugging formats.

<dd>A C expression that returns the DBX register number for the compiler
register number <var>regno</var>.  In simple cases, the value of this
expression may be <var>regno</var> itself.  But sometimes there are some
registers that the compiler knows about and DBX does not, or vice
versa.  In such cases, some register may need to have one number in
the compiler and another for DBX.

<p>If two registers have consecutive numbers inside GNU CC, and they can be
used as a pair to hold a multiword value, then they <em>must</em> have
consecutive numbers after renumbering with <code>DBX_REGISTER_NUMBER</code>. 
Otherwise, debuggers will be unable to access such a pair, because they
expect register pairs to be consecutive in their own numbering scheme.

<p>If you find yourself defining <code>DBX_REGISTER_NUMBER</code> in way that
does not preserve register pairs, then what you must do instead is
redefine the actual register numbering scheme.

<br><dt><code>DEBUGGER_AUTO_OFFSET (<var>x</var>)</code>
<dd>A C expression that returns the integer offset value for an automatic
variable having address <var>x</var> (an RTL expression).  The default
computation assumes that <var>x</var> is based on the frame-pointer and
gives the offset from the frame-pointer.  This is required for targets
that produce debugging output for DBX or COFF-style debugging output
for SDB and allow the frame-pointer to be eliminated when the
<code>-g</code> options is used.

<br><dt><code>DEBUGGER_ARG_OFFSET (<var>offset</var>, <var>x</var>)</code>
<dd>A C expression that returns the integer offset value for an argument
having address <var>x</var> (an RTL expression).  The nominal offset is
<var>offset</var>.

<br><dt><code>PREFERRED_DEBUGGING_TYPE</code>
<dd>A C expression that returns the type of debugging output GNU CC should
produce when the user specifies just <code>-g</code>.  Define
this if you have arranged for GNU CC to support more than one format of
debugging output.  Currently, the allowable values are <code>DBX_DEBUG</code>,
<code>SDB_DEBUG</code>, <code>DWARF_DEBUG</code>, <code>DWARF2_DEBUG</code>, and
<code>XCOFF_DEBUG</code>.

<p>When the user specifies <code>-ggdb</code>, GNU CC normally also uses the
value of this macro to select the debugging output format, but with two
exceptions.  If <code>DWARF2_DEBUGGING_INFO</code> is defined and
<code>LINKER_DOES_NOT_WORK_WITH_DWARF2</code> is not defined, GNU CC uses the
value <code>DWARF2_DEBUG</code>.  Otherwise, if <code>DBX_DEBUGGING_INFO</code> is
defined, GNU CC uses <code>DBX_DEBUG</code>.

<p>The value of this macro only affects the default debugging output; the
user can always get a specific type of output by using <code>-gstabs</code>,
<code>-gcoff</code>, <code>-gdwarf-1</code>, <code>-gdwarf-2</code>, or <code>-gxcoff</code>.

<h3>Specific Options for DBX Output</h3>

<p>These are specific options for DBX output.

<dl>
<dt><code>DBX_DEBUGGING_INFO</code>
<dd>Define this macro if GNU CC should produce debugging output for DBX
in response to the <code>-g</code> option.

<br><dt><code>XCOFF_DEBUGGING_INFO</code>
<dd>Define this macro if GNU CC should produce XCOFF format debugging output
in response to the <code>-g</code> option.  This is a variant of DBX format.

<br><dt><code>DEFAULT_GDB_EXTENSIONS</code>
<dd>Define this macro to control whether GNU CC should by default generate
GDB's extended version of DBX debugging information (assuming DBX-format
debugging information is enabled at all).  If you don't define the
macro, the default is 1: always generate the extended information
if there is any occasion to.

<br><dt><code>DEBUG_SYMS_TEXT</code>
<dd>Define this macro if all <code>.stabs</code> commands should be output while
in the text section.

<br><dt><code>ASM_STABS_OP</code>
<dd>A C string constant naming the assembler pseudo op to use instead of
<code>.stabs</code> to define an ordinary debugging symbol.  If you don't
define this macro, <code>.stabs</code> is used.  This macro applies only to
DBX debugging information format.

<br><dt><code>ASM_STABD_OP</code>
<dd>A C string constant naming the assembler pseudo op to use instead of
<code>.stabd</code> to define a debugging symbol whose value is the current
location.  If you don't define this macro, <code>.stabd</code> is used. 
This macro applies only to DBX debugging information format.

<br><dt><code>ASM_STABN_OP</code>
<dd>A C string constant naming the assembler pseudo op to use instead of
<code>.stabn</code> to define a debugging symbol with no name.  If you don't
define this macro, <code>.stabn</code> is used.  This macro applies only to
DBX debugging information format.

<br><dt><code>DBX_NO_XREFS</code>
<dd>Define this macro if DBX on your system does not support the construct
<code>xs<var>tagname</var></code>.  On some systems, this construct is used to
describe a forward reference to a structure named <var>tagname</var>. 
On other systems, this construct is not supported at all.

<br><dt><code>DBX_CONTIN_LENGTH</code>
<dd>A symbol name in DBX-format debugging information is normally
continued (split into two separate <code>.stabs</code> directives) when it
exceeds a certain length (by default, 80 characters).  On some
operating systems, DBX requires this splitting; on others, splitting
must not be done.  You can inhibit splitting by defining this macro
with the value zero.  You can override the default splitting-length by
defining this macro as an expression for the length you desire.

<br><dt><code>DBX_CONTIN_CHAR</code>
<dd>Normally continuation is indicated by adding a <code>\</code> character to
the end of a <code>.stabs</code> string when a continuation follows.  To use
a different character instead, define this macro as a character
constant for the character you want to use.  Do not define this macro
if backslash is correct for your system.

<br><dt><code>DBX_STATIC_STAB_DATA_SECTION</code>
<dd>Define this macro if it is necessary to go to the data section before
outputting the <code>.stabs</code> pseudo-op for a non-global static
variable.

<br><dt><code>DBX_TYPE_DECL_STABS_CODE</code>
<dd>The value to use in the "code" field of the <code>.stabs</code> directive
for a typedef.  The default is <code>N_LSYM</code>.

<br><dt><code>DBX_STATIC_CONST_VAR_CODE</code>
<dd>The value to use in the "code" field of the <code>.stabs</code> directive
for a static variable located in the text section.  DBX format does not
provide any "right" way to do this.  The default is <code>N_FUN</code>.

<br><dt><code>DBX_REGPARM_STABS_CODE</code>
<dd>The value to use in the "code" field of the <code>.stabs</code> directive
for a parameter passed in registers.  DBX format does not provide any
"right" way to do this.  The default is <code>N_RSYM</code>.

<br><dt><code>DBX_REGPARM_STABS_LETTER</code>
<dd>The letter to use in DBX symbol data to identify a symbol as a parameter
passed in registers.  DBX format does not customarily provide any way to
do this.  The default is <code>'P'</code>.

<br><dt><code>DBX_MEMPARM_STABS_LETTER</code>
<dd>The letter to use in DBX symbol data to identify a symbol as a stack
parameter.  The default is <code>'p'</code>.

<br><dt><code>DBX_FUNCTION_FIRST</code>
<dd>Define this macro if the DBX information for a function and its
arguments should precede the assembler code for the function.  Normally,
in DBX format, the debugging information entirely follows the assembler
code.

<br><dt><code>DBX_LBRAC_FIRST</code>
<dd>Define this macro if the <code>N_LBRAC</code> symbol for a block should
precede the debugging information for variables and functions defined in
that block.  Normally, in DBX format, the <code>N_LBRAC</code> symbol comes
first.

<br><dt><code>DBX_BLOCKS_FUNCTION_RELATIVE</code>
<dd>Define this macro if the value of a symbol describing the scope of a
block (<code>N_LBRAC</code> or <code>N_RBRAC</code>) should be relative to the start
of the enclosing function.  Normally, GNU C uses an absolute address.

<br><dt><code>DBX_USE_BINCL</code>
<dd>Define this macro if GNU C should generate <code>N_BINCL</code> and
<code>N_EINCL</code> stabs for included header files, as on Sun systems.  This
macro also directs GNU C to output a type number as a pair of a file
number and a type number within the file.  Normally, GNU C does not
generate <code>N_BINCL</code> or <code>N_EINCL</code> stabs, and it outputs a single
number for a type number.

<h3>Open-Ended Hooks for DBX Format</h3>

<p>These are hooks for DBX format.

<dl>
<dt><code>DBX_OUTPUT_LBRAC (<var>stream</var>, <var>name</var>)</code>
<dd>Define this macro to say how to output to <var>stream</var> the debugging
information for the start of a scope level for variable names.  The
argument <var>name</var> is the name of an assembler symbol (for use with
<code>assemble_name</code>) whose value is the address where the scope begins.

<br><dt><code>DBX_OUTPUT_RBRAC (<var>stream</var>, <var>name</var>)</code>
<dd>Like <code>DBX_OUTPUT_LBRAC</code>, but for the end of a scope level.

<br><dt><code>DBX_OUTPUT_ENUM (<var>stream</var>, <var>type</var>)</code>
<dd>Define this macro if the target machine requires special handling to
output an enumeration type.  The definition should be a C statement
(sans semicolon) to output the appropriate information to <var>stream</var>
for the type <var>type</var>.

<br><dt><code>DBX_OUTPUT_FUNCTION_END (<var>stream</var>, <var>function</var>)</code>
<dd>Define this macro if the target machine requires special output at the
end of the debugging information for a function.  The definition should
be a C statement (sans semicolon) to output the appropriate information
to <var>stream</var>.  <var>function</var> is the <code>FUNCTION_DECL</code> node for
the function.

<br><dt><code>DBX_OUTPUT_STANDARD_TYPES (<var>syms</var>)</code>
<dd>Define this macro if you need to control the order of output of the
standard data types at the beginning of compilation.  The argument
<var>syms</var> is a <code>tree</code> which is a chain of all the predefined
global symbols, including names of data types.

<p>Normally, DBX output starts with definitions of the types for integers
and characters, followed by all the other predefined types of the
particular language in no particular order.

<p>On some machines, it is necessary to output different particular types
first.  To do this, define <code>DBX_OUTPUT_STANDARD_TYPES</code> to output
those symbols in the necessary order.  Any predefined types that you
don't explicitly output will be output afterward in no particular order.

<p>Be careful not to define this macro so that it works only for C.  There
are no global variables to access most of the built-in types, because
another language may have another set of types.  The way to output a
particular type is to look through <var>syms</var> to see if you can find it. 
Here is an example:

<pre>{
  tree decl;
  for (decl = syms; decl; decl = TREE_CHAIN (decl))
    if (!strcmp (IDENTIFIER_POINTER (DECL_NAME (decl)),
                 "long int"))
      dbxout_symbol (decl);
  <small>...</small>
}
</pre>

<p>This does nothing if the expected type does not exist.

<p>See the function <code>init_decl_processing</code> in <code>c-decl.c</code> to find
the names to use for all the built-in C types.

<p>Here is another way of finding a particular type:

<pre>{
  tree decl;
  for (decl = syms; decl; decl = TREE_CHAIN (decl))
    if (TREE_CODE (decl) == TYPE_DECL
        &amp;&amp; (TREE_CODE (TREE_TYPE (decl))
            == INTEGER_CST)
        &amp;&amp; TYPE_PRECISION (TREE_TYPE (decl)) == 16
        &amp;&amp; TYPE_UNSIGNED (TREE_TYPE (decl)))
      /* This must be <code>unsigned short</code>.  */
      dbxout_symbol (decl);
  <small>...</small>
}
</pre>

<br><dt><code>NO_DBX_FUNCTION_END</code>
<dd>Some stabs encapsulation formats (in particular ECOFF), cannot handle the
<code>.stabs "",N_FUN,,0,0,Lscope-function-1</code> gdb dbx extention construct. 
On those machines, define this macro to turn this feature off without
disturbing the rest of the gdb extensions.

<h3>File Names in DBX Format</h3>

<p>This describes file names in DBX format.

<dl>
<dt><code>DBX_WORKING_DIRECTORY</code>
<dd>Define this if DBX wants to have the current directory recorded in each
object file.

<p>Note that the working directory is always recorded if GDB extensions are
enabled.

<br><dt><code>DBX_OUTPUT_MAIN_SOURCE_FILENAME (<var>stream</var>, <var>name</var>)</code>
<dd>A C statement to output DBX debugging information to the stdio stream
<var>stream</var> which indicates that file <var>name</var> is the main source
file--the file specified as the input file for compilation. 
This macro is called only once, at the beginning of compilation.

<p>This macro need not be defined if the standard form of output
for DBX debugging information is appropriate.

<br><dt><code>DBX_OUTPUT_MAIN_SOURCE_DIRECTORY (<var>stream</var>, <var>name</var>)</code>
<dd>A C statement to output DBX debugging information to the stdio stream
<var>stream</var> which indicates that the current directory during
compilation is named <var>name</var>.

<p>This macro need not be defined if the standard form of output
for DBX debugging information is appropriate.

<br><dt><code>DBX_OUTPUT_MAIN_SOURCE_FILE_END (<var>stream</var>, <var>name</var>)</code>
<dd>A C statement to output DBX debugging information at the end of
compilation of the main source file <var>name</var>.

<p>If you don't define this macro, nothing special is output at the end
of compilation, which is correct for most machines.

<br><dt><code>DBX_OUTPUT_SOURCE_FILENAME (<var>stream</var>, <var>name</var>)</code>
<dd>A C statement to output DBX debugging information to the stdio stream
<var>stream</var> which indicates that file <var>name</var> is the current source
file.  This output is generated each time input shifts to a different
source file as a result of <code>#include</code>, the end of an included file,
or a <code>#line</code> command.

<p>This macro need not be defined if the standard form of output
for DBX debugging information is appropriate.

<h3>Macros for SDB and DWARF Output</h3>

<p>Here are macros for SDB and DWARF output.

<dl>
<dt><code>SDB_DEBUGGING_INFO</code>
<dd>Define this macro if GNU CC should produce COFF-style debugging output
for SDB in response to the <code>-g</code> option.

<br><dt><code>DWARF_DEBUGGING_INFO</code>
<dd>Define this macro if GNU CC should produce dwarf format debugging output
in response to the <code>-g</code> option.

<br><dt><code>DWARF2_DEBUGGING_INFO</code>
<dd>Define this macro if GNU CC should produce dwarf version 2 format
debugging output in response to the <code>-g</code> option.

<p>To support optional call frame debugging information, you must also
define <code>INCOMING_RETURN_ADDR_RTX</code> and either set
<code>RTX_FRAME_RELATED_P</code> on the prologue insns if you use RTL for the
prologue, or call <code>dwarf2out_def_cfa</code> and <code>dwarf2out_reg_save</code>
as appropriate from <code>FUNCTION_PROLOGUE</code> if you don't.

<br><dt><code>DWARF2_FRAME_INFO</code>
<dd>Define this macro to a nonzero value if GNU CC should always output
Dwarf 2 frame information.  If <code>DWARF2_UNWIND_INFO</code>
(see <a href="#Exception%20Region%20Output">Exception Region Output</a> is nonzero, GNU CC will output this
information not matter how you define <code>DWARF2_FRAME_INFO</code>.

<br><dt><code>LINKER_DOES_NOT_WORK_WITH_DWARF2</code>
<dd>Define this macro if the linker does not work with Dwarf version 2. 
Normally, if the user specifies only <code>-ggdb</code> GNU CC will use Dwarf
version 2 if available; this macro disables this.  See the description
of the <code>PREFERRED_DEBUGGING_TYPE</code> macro for more details.

<br><dt><code>PUT_SDB_<small>...</small></code>
<dd>Define these macros to override the assembler syntax for the special
SDB assembler directives.  See <code>sdbout.c</code> for a list of these
macros and their arguments.  If the standard syntax is used, you need
not define them yourself.

<br><dt><code>SDB_DELIM</code>
<dd>Some assemblers do not support a semicolon as a delimiter, even between
SDB assembler directives.  In that case, define this macro to be the
delimiter to use (usually <code>\n</code>).  It is not necessary to define
a new set of <code>PUT_SDB_<var>op</var></code> macros if this is the only change
required.

<br><dt><code>SDB_GENERATE_FAKE</code>
<dd>Define this macro to override the usual method of constructing a dummy
name for anonymous structure and union types.  See <code>sdbout.c</code> for
more information.

<br><dt><code>SDB_ALLOW_UNKNOWN_REFERENCES</code>
<dd>Define this macro to allow references to unknown structure,
union, or enumeration tags to be emitted.  Standard COFF does not
allow handling of unknown references, MIPS ECOFF has support for
it.

<br><dt><code>SDB_ALLOW_FORWARD_REFERENCES</code>
<dd>Define this macro to allow references to structure, union, or
enumeration tags that have not yet been seen to be handled.  Some
assemblers choke if forward tags are used, while some require it.

<h2>Cross Compilation and Floating Point</h2>

<p>While all modern machines use 2's complement representation for integers,
there are a variety of representations for floating point numbers.  This
means that in a cross-compiler the representation of floating point numbers
in the compiled program may be different from that used in the machine
doing the compilation.

<p>Because different representation systems may offer different amounts of
range and precision, the cross compiler cannot safely use the host
machine's floating point arithmetic.  Therefore, floating point constants
must be represented in the target machine's format.  This means that the
cross compiler cannot use <code>atof</code> to parse a floating point constant;
it must have its own special routine to use instead.  Also, constant
folding must emulate the target machine's arithmetic (or must not be done
at all).

<p>The macros in the following table should be defined only if you are cross
compiling between different floating point formats.

<p>Otherwise, don't define them.  Then default definitions will be set up which
use <code>double</code> as the data type, <code>==</code> to test for equality, etc.

<p>You don't need to worry about how many times you use an operand of any
of these macros.  The compiler never uses operands which have side effects.

<dl>
<dt><code>REAL_VALUE_TYPE</code>
<dd>A macro for the C data type to be used to hold a floating point value
in the target machine's format.  Typically this would be a
<code>struct</code> containing an array of <code>int</code>.

<br><dt><code>REAL_VALUES_EQUAL (<var>x</var>, <var>y</var>)</code>
<dd>A macro for a C expression which compares for equality the two values,
<var>x</var> and <var>y</var>, both of type <code>REAL_VALUE_TYPE</code>.

<br><dt><code>REAL_VALUES_LESS (<var>x</var>, <var>y</var>)</code>
<dd>A macro for a C expression which tests whether <var>x</var> is less than
<var>y</var>, both values being of type <code>REAL_VALUE_TYPE</code> and
interpreted as floating point numbers in the target machine's
representation.

<br><dt><code>REAL_VALUE_LDEXP (<var>x</var>, <var>scale</var>)</code>
<dd>A macro for a C expression which performs the standard library
function <code>ldexp</code>, but using the target machine's floating point
representation.  Both <var>x</var> and the value of the expression have
type <code>REAL_VALUE_TYPE</code>.  The second argument, <var>scale</var>, is an
integer.

<br><dt><code>REAL_VALUE_FIX (<var>x</var>)</code>
<dd>A macro whose definition is a C expression to convert the target-machine
floating point value <var>x</var> to a signed integer.  <var>x</var> has type
<code>REAL_VALUE_TYPE</code>.

<br><dt><code>REAL_VALUE_UNSIGNED_FIX (<var>x</var>)</code>
<dd>A macro whose definition is a C expression to convert the target-machine
floating point value <var>x</var> to an unsigned integer.  <var>x</var> has type
<code>REAL_VALUE_TYPE</code>.

<br><dt><code>REAL_VALUE_RNDZINT (<var>x</var>)</code>
<dd>A macro whose definition is a C expression to round the target-machine
floating point value <var>x</var> towards zero to an integer value (but still
as a floating point number).  <var>x</var> has type <code>REAL_VALUE_TYPE</code>,
and so does the value.

<br><dt><code>REAL_VALUE_UNSIGNED_RNDZINT (<var>x</var>)</code>
<dd>A macro whose definition is a C expression to round the target-machine
floating point value <var>x</var> towards zero to an unsigned integer value
(but still represented as a floating point number).  <var>x</var> has type
<code>REAL_VALUE_TYPE</code>, and so does the value.

<br><dt><code>REAL_VALUE_ATOF (<var>string</var>, <var>mode</var>)</code>
<dd>A macro for a C expression which converts <var>string</var>, an expression of
type <code>char *</code>, into a floating point number in the target machine's
representation for mode <var>mode</var>.  The value has type
<code>REAL_VALUE_TYPE</code>.

<br><dt><code>REAL_INFINITY</code>
<dd>Define this macro if infinity is a possible floating point value, and
therefore division by 0 is legitimate.

<br><dt><code>REAL_VALUE_ISINF (<var>x</var>)</code>
<dd>A macro for a C expression which determines whether <var>x</var>, a floating
point value, is infinity.  The value has type <code>int</code>. 
By default, this is defined to call <code>isinf</code>.

<br><dt><code>REAL_VALUE_ISNAN (<var>x</var>)</code>
<dd>A macro for a C expression which determines whether <var>x</var>, a floating
point value, is a "nan" (not-a-number).  The value has type
<code>int</code>.  By default, this is defined to call <code>isnan</code>. 
</dl>

<p>Define the following additional macros if you want to make floating
point constant folding work while cross compiling.  If you don't
define them, cross compilation is still possible, but constant folding
will not happen for floating point values.

<dl>
<dt><code>REAL_ARITHMETIC (<var>output</var>, <var>code</var>, <var>x</var>, <var>y</var>)</code>
<dd>A macro for a C statement which calculates an arithmetic operation of
the two floating point values <var>x</var> and <var>y</var>, both of type
<code>REAL_VALUE_TYPE</code> in the target machine's representation, to
produce a result of the same type and representation which is stored
in <var>output</var> (which will be a variable).

<p>The operation to be performed is specified by <var>code</var>, a tree code
which will always be one of the following: <code>PLUS_EXPR</code>,
<code>MINUS_EXPR</code>, <code>MULT_EXPR</code>, <code>RDIV_EXPR</code>,
<code>MAX_EXPR</code>, <code>MIN_EXPR</code>.

<p>The expansion of this macro is responsible for checking for overflow. 
If overflow happens, the macro expansion should execute the statement
<code>return 0;</code>, which indicates the inability to perform the
arithmetic operation requested.

<br><dt><code>REAL_VALUE_NEGATE (<var>x</var>)</code>
<dd>A macro for a C expression which returns the negative of the floating
point value <var>x</var>.  Both <var>x</var> and the value of the expression
have type <code>REAL_VALUE_TYPE</code> and are in the target machine's
floating point representation.

<p>There is no way for this macro to report overflow, since overflow
can't happen in the negation operation.

<br><dt><code>REAL_VALUE_TRUNCATE (<var>mode</var>, <var>x</var>)</code>
<dd>A macro for a C expression which converts the floating point value
<var>x</var> to mode <var>mode</var>.

<p>Both <var>x</var> and the value of the expression are in the target machine's
floating point representation and have type <code>REAL_VALUE_TYPE</code>. 
However, the value should have an appropriate bit pattern to be output
properly as a floating constant whose precision accords with mode
<var>mode</var>.

<p>There is no way for this macro to report overflow.

<br><dt><code>REAL_VALUE_TO_INT (<var>low</var>, <var>high</var>, <var>x</var>)</code>
<dd>A macro for a C expression which converts a floating point value
<var>x</var> into a double-precision integer which is then stored into
<var>low</var> and <var>high</var>, two variables of type <var>int</var>.

<br><dt><code>REAL_VALUE_FROM_INT (<var>x</var>, <var>low</var>, <var>high</var>, <var>mode</var>)</code>
<dd>A macro for a C expression which converts a double-precision integer
found in <var>low</var> and <var>high</var>, two variables of type <var>int</var>,
into a floating point value which is then stored into <var>x</var>. 
The value is in the target machine's representation for mode <var>mode</var>
and has the type <code>REAL_VALUE_TYPE</code>.

<h2>Miscellaneous Parameters</h2>

<p>Here are several miscellaneous parameters.

<dl>
<dt><code>PREDICATE_CODES</code>
<dd>Define this if you have defined special-purpose predicates in the file
<code><var>machine</var>.c</code>.  This macro is called within an initializer of an
array of structures.  The first field in the structure is the name of a
predicate and the second field is an array of rtl codes.  For each
predicate, list all rtl codes that can be in expressions matched by the
predicate.  The list should have a trailing comma.  Here is an example
of two entries in the list for a typical RISC machine:

<pre>#define PREDICATE_CODES \
  {"gen_reg_rtx_operand", {SUBREG, REG}},  \
  {"reg_or_short_cint_operand", {SUBREG, REG, CONST_INT}},
</pre>

<p>Defining this macro does not affect the generated code (however,
incorrect definitions that omit an rtl code that may be matched by the
predicate can cause the compiler to malfunction).  Instead, it allows
the table built by <code>genrecog</code> to be more compact and efficient,
thus speeding up the compiler.  The most important predicates to include
in the list specified by this macro are those used in the most insn
patterns.

<br><dt><code>CASE_VECTOR_MODE</code>
<dd>An alias for a machine mode name.  This is the machine mode that
elements of a jump-table should have.

<br><dt><code>CASE_VECTOR_SHORTEN_MODE (<var>min_offset</var>, <var>max_offset</var>, <var>body</var>)</code>
<dd>Optional: return the preferred mode for an <code>addr_diff_vec</code>
when the minimum and maximum offset are known.  If you define this,
it enables extra code in branch shortening to deal with <code>addr_diff_vec</code>. 
To make this work, you also have to define INSN_ALIGN and
make the alignment for <code>addr_diff_vec</code> explicit. 
The <var>body</var> argument is provided so that the offset_unsigned and scale
flags can be updated.

<br><dt><code>CASE_VECTOR_PC_RELATIVE</code>
<dd>Define this macro to be a C expression to indicate when jump-tables
should contain relative addresses.  If jump-tables never contain
relative addresses, then you need not define this macro.

<br><dt><code>CASE_DROPS_THROUGH</code>
<dd>Define this if control falls through a <code>case</code> insn when the index
value is out of range.  This means the specified default-label is
actually ignored by the <code>case</code> insn proper.

<br><dt><code>CASE_VALUES_THRESHOLD</code>
<dd>Define this to be the smallest number of different values for which it
is best to use a jump-table instead of a tree of conditional branches. 
The default is four for machines with a <code>casesi</code> instruction and
five otherwise.  This is best for most machines.

<br><dt><code>WORD_REGISTER_OPERATIONS</code>
<dd>Define this macro if operations between registers with integral mode
smaller than a word are always performed on the entire register. 
Most RISC machines have this property and most CISC machines do not.

<br><dt><code>LOAD_EXTEND_OP (<var>mode</var>)</code>
<dd>Define this macro to be a C expression indicating when insns that read
memory in <var>mode</var>, an integral mode narrower than a word, set the
bits outside of <var>mode</var> to be either the sign-extension or the
zero-extension of the data read.  Return <code>SIGN_EXTEND</code> for values
of <var>mode</var> for which the
insn sign-extends, <code>ZERO_EXTEND</code> for which it zero-extends, and
<code>NIL</code> for other modes.

<p>This macro is not called with <var>mode</var> non-integral or with a width
greater than or equal to <code>BITS_PER_WORD</code>, so you may return any
value in this case.  Do not define this macro if it would always return
<code>NIL</code>.  On machines where this macro is defined, you will normally
define it as the constant <code>SIGN_EXTEND</code> or <code>ZERO_EXTEND</code>.

<br><dt><code>SHORT_IMMEDIATES_SIGN_EXTEND</code>
<dd>Define this macro if loading short immediate values into registers sign
extends.

<br><dt><code>IMPLICIT_FIX_EXPR</code>
<dd>An alias for a tree code that should be used by default for conversion
of floating point values to fixed point.  Normally,
<code>FIX_ROUND_EXPR</code> is used.

<br><dt><code>FIXUNS_TRUNC_LIKE_FIX_TRUNC</code>
<dd>Define this macro if the same instructions that convert a floating
point number to a signed fixed point number also convert validly to an
unsigned one.

<br><dt><code>EASY_DIV_EXPR</code>
<dd>An alias for a tree code that is the easiest kind of division to
compile code for in the general case.  It may be
<code>TRUNC_DIV_EXPR</code>, <code>FLOOR_DIV_EXPR</code>, <code>CEIL_DIV_EXPR</code> or
<code>ROUND_DIV_EXPR</code>.  These four division operators differ in how
they round the result to an integer.  <code>EASY_DIV_EXPR</code> is used
when it is permissible to use any of those kinds of division and the
choice should be made on the basis of efficiency.

<br><dt><code>MOVE_MAX</code>
<dd>The maximum number of bytes that a single instruction can move quickly
between memory and registers or between two memory locations.

<br><dt><code>MAX_MOVE_MAX</code>
<dd>The maximum number of bytes that a single instruction can move quickly
between memory and registers or between two memory locations.  If this
is undefined, the default is <code>MOVE_MAX</code>.  Otherwise, it is the
constant value that is the largest value that <code>MOVE_MAX</code> can have
at run-time.

<br><dt><code>SHIFT_COUNT_TRUNCATED</code>
<dd>A C expression that is nonzero if on this machine the number of bits
actually used for the count of a shift operation is equal to the number
of bits needed to represent the size of the object being shifted.  When
this macro is non-zero, the compiler will assume that it is safe to omit
a sign-extend, zero-extend, and certain bitwise `and' instructions that
truncates the count of a shift operation.  On machines that have
instructions that act on bitfields at variable positions, which may
include `bit test' instructions, a nonzero <code>SHIFT_COUNT_TRUNCATED</code>
also enables deletion of truncations of the values that serve as
arguments to bitfield instructions.

<p>If both types of instructions truncate the count (for shifts) and
position (for bitfield operations), or if no variable-position bitfield
instructions exist, you should define this macro.

<p>However, on some machines, such as the 80386 and the 680x0, truncation
only applies to shift operations and not the (real or pretended)
bitfield operations.  Define <code>SHIFT_COUNT_TRUNCATED</code> to be zero on
such machines.  Instead, add patterns to the <code>md</code> file that include
the implied truncation of the shift instructions.

<p>You need not define this macro if it would always have the value of zero.

<br><dt><code>TRULY_NOOP_TRUNCATION (<var>outprec</var>, <var>inprec</var>)</code>
<dd>A C expression which is nonzero if on this machine it is safe to
"convert" an integer of <var>inprec</var> bits to one of <var>outprec</var>
bits (where <var>outprec</var> is smaller than <var>inprec</var>) by merely
operating on it as if it had only <var>outprec</var> bits.

<p>On many machines, this expression can be 1.

<p>When <code>TRULY_NOOP_TRUNCATION</code> returns 1 for a pair of sizes for
modes for which <code>MODES_TIEABLE_P</code> is 0, suboptimal code can result. 
If this is the case, making <code>TRULY_NOOP_TRUNCATION</code> return 0 in
such cases may improve things.

<br><dt><code>STORE_FLAG_VALUE</code>
<dd>A C expression describing the value returned by a comparison operator
with an integral mode and stored by a store-flag instruction
(<code>s<var>cond</var></code>) when the condition is true.  This description must
apply to <em>all</em> the <code>s<var>cond</var></code> patterns and all the
comparison operators whose results have a <code>MODE_INT</code> mode.

<p>A value of 1 or -1 means that the instruction implementing the
comparison operator returns exactly 1 or -1 when the comparison is true
and 0 when the comparison is false.  Otherwise, the value indicates
which bits of the result are guaranteed to be 1 when the comparison is
true.  This value is interpreted in the mode of the comparison
operation, which is given by the mode of the first operand in the
<code>s<var>cond</var></code> pattern.  Either the low bit or the sign bit of
<code>STORE_FLAG_VALUE</code> be on.  Presently, only those bits are used by
the compiler.

<p>If <code>STORE_FLAG_VALUE</code> is neither 1 or -1, the compiler will
generate code that depends only on the specified bits.  It can also
replace comparison operators with equivalent operations if they cause
the required bits to be set, even if the remaining bits are undefined. 
For example, on a machine whose comparison operators return an
<code>SImode</code> value and where <code>STORE_FLAG_VALUE</code> is defined as
<code>0x80000000</code>, saying that just the sign bit is relevant, the
expression

<pre>(ne:SI (and:SI <var>x</var> (const_int <var>power-of-2</var>)) (const_int 0))
</pre>

<p>can be converted to

<pre>(ashift:SI <var>x</var> (const_int <var>n</var>))
</pre>

<p>where <var>n</var> is the appropriate shift count to move the bit being
tested into the sign bit.

<p>There is no way to describe a machine that always sets the low-order bit
for a true value, but does not guarantee the value of any other bits,
but we do not know of any machine that has such an instruction.  If you
are trying to port GNU CC to such a machine, include an instruction to
perform a logical-and of the result with 1 in the pattern for the
comparison operators and let us know
(see <a href="#Bug%20Reporting">How to Report Bugs</a>).

<p>Often, a machine will have multiple instructions that obtain a value
from a comparison (or the condition codes).  Here are rules to guide the
choice of value for <code>STORE_FLAG_VALUE</code>, and hence the instructions
to be used:

<ul>
<li>Use the shortest sequence that yields a valid definition for
<code>STORE_FLAG_VALUE</code>.  It is more efficient for the compiler to
"normalize" the value (convert it to, e.g., 1 or 0) than for the
comparison operators to do so because there may be opportunities to
combine the normalization with other operations.

<li>For equal-length sequences, use a value of 1 or -1, with -1 being
slightly preferred on machines with expensive jumps and 1 preferred on
other machines.

<li>As a second choice, choose a value of <code>0x80000001</code> if instructions
exist that set both the sign and low-order bits but do not define the
others.

<li>Otherwise, use a value of <code>0x80000000</code>. 
</ul>

<p>Many machines can produce both the value chosen for
<code>STORE_FLAG_VALUE</code> and its negation in the same number of
instructions.  On those machines, you should also define a pattern for
those cases, e.g., one matching

<pre>(set <var>A</var> (neg:<var>m</var> (ne:<var>m</var> <var>B</var> <var>C</var>)))
</pre>

<p>Some machines can also perform <code>and</code> or <code>plus</code> operations on
condition code values with less instructions than the corresponding
<code>s<var>cond</var></code> insn followed by <code>and</code> or <code>plus</code>.  On those
machines, define the appropriate patterns.  Use the names <code>incscc</code>
and <code>decscc</code>, respectively, for the patterns which perform
<code>plus</code> or <code>minus</code> operations on condition code values.  See
<code>rs6000.md</code> for some examples.  The GNU Superoptizer can be used to
find such instruction sequences on other machines.

<p>You need not define <code>STORE_FLAG_VALUE</code> if the machine has no store-flag
instructions.

<br><dt><code>FLOAT_STORE_FLAG_VALUE</code>
<dd>A C expression that gives a non-zero floating point value that is
returned when comparison operators with floating-point results are true. 
Define this macro on machine that have comparison operations that return
floating-point values.  If there are no such operations, do not define
this macro.

<br><dt><code>Pmode</code>
<dd>An alias for the machine mode for pointers.  On most machines, define
this to be the integer mode corresponding to the width of a hardware
pointer; <code>SImode</code> on 32-bit machine or <code>DImode</code> on 64-bit machines. 
On some machines you must define this to be one of the partial integer
modes, such as <code>PSImode</code>.

<p>The width of <code>Pmode</code> must be at least as large as the value of
<code>POINTER_SIZE</code>.  If it is not equal, you must define the macro
<code>POINTERS_EXTEND_UNSIGNED</code> to specify how pointers are extended
to <code>Pmode</code>.

<br><dt><code>FUNCTION_MODE</code>
<dd>An alias for the machine mode used for memory references to functions
being called, in <code>call</code> RTL expressions.  On most machines this
should be <code>QImode</code>.

<br><dt><code>INTEGRATE_THRESHOLD (<var>decl</var>)</code>
<dd>A C expression for the maximum number of instructions above which the
function <var>decl</var> should not be inlined.  <var>decl</var> is a
<code>FUNCTION_DECL</code> node.

<p>The default definition of this macro is 64 plus 8 times the number of
arguments that the function accepts.  Some people think a larger
threshold should be used on RISC machines.

<br><dt><code>SCCS_DIRECTIVE</code>
<dd>Define this if the preprocessor should ignore <code>#sccs</code> directives
and print no error message.

<br><dt><code>NO_IMPLICIT_EXTERN_C</code>
<dd>Define this macro if the system header files support C++ as well as C. 
This macro inhibits the usual method of using system header files in
C++, which is to pretend that the file's contents are enclosed in
<code>extern "C" {<small>...</small>}</code>.

<br><dt><code>HANDLE_PRAGMA (<var>getc</var>, <var>ungetc</var>, <var>name</var>)</code>
<dd>Define this macro if you want to implement any pragmas.  If defined, it
is a C expression whose value is 1 if the pragma was handled by the
macro, zero otherwise.  The argument <var>getc</var> is a function of type
<code>int (*)(void)</code> which will return the next character in the input
stream, or EOF if no characters are left.  The argument <var>ungetc</var> is
a function of type <code>void (*)(int)</code> which will push a character back
into the input stream.  The argument <var>name</var> is the word following
#pragma in the input stream.  The input stream pointer will be pointing
just beyond the end of this word.  The input stream should be left
undistrubed if the expression returns zero, otherwise it should be
pointing at the next character after the end of the pragma.  Any
characters remaining on the line will be ignored.

<p>It is generally a bad idea to implement new uses of <code>#pragma</code>.  The
only reason to define this macro is for compatibility with other
compilers that do support <code>#pragma</code> for the sake of any user
programs which already use it.

<p>If the pragma can be implemented by atttributes then the macro
<code>INSERT_ATTRIBUTES</code> might be a useful one to define as well.

<p>Note: older versions of this macro only had two arguments: <var>stream</var>
and <var>token</var>.  The macro was changed in order to allow it to work
when gcc is built both with and without a cpp library.

<br><dt><code>HANDLE_SYSV_PRAGMA</code>
<dd>Define this macro (to a value of 1) if you want the System V style
pragmas <code>#pragma pack(&lt;n&gt;)</code> and <code>#pragma weak &lt;name&gt;
[=&lt;value&gt;]</code> to be supported by gcc.

<p>The pack pragma specifies the maximum alignment (in bytes) of fields
within a structure, in much the same way as the <code>__aligned__</code> and
<code>__packed__</code> <code>__attribute__</code>s do.  A pack value of zero resets
the behaviour to the default.

<p>The weak pragma only works if <code>SUPPORTS_WEAK</code> and
<code>ASM_WEAKEN_LABEL</code> are defined.  If enabled it allows the creation
of specifically named weak labels, optionally with a value.

<br><dt><code>HANDLE_PRAGMA_PACK_PUSH_POP</code>
<dd>Define this macro (to a value of 1) if you want to support the Win32
style pragmas <code>#pragma pack(push,&lt;n&gt;)</code> and <code>#pragma
pack(pop)</code>.  The pack(push,&lt;n&gt;) pragma specifies the maximum alignment
(in bytes) of fields within a structure, in much the same way as the
<code>__aligned__</code> and <code>__packed__</code> <code>__attribute__</code>s do.  A
pack value of zero resets the behaviour to the default.  Successive
invocations of this pragma cause the previous values to be stacked, so
that invocations of <code>#pragma pack(pop)</code> will return to the previous
value.

<br><dt><code>VALID_MACHINE_DECL_ATTRIBUTE (<var>decl</var>, <var>attributes</var>, <var>identifier</var>, <var>args</var>)</code>
<dd>If defined, a C expression whose value is nonzero if <var>identifier</var> with
arguments <var>args</var> is a valid machine specific attribute for <var>decl</var>. 
The attributes in <var>attributes</var> have previously been assigned to <var>decl</var>.

<br><dt><code>VALID_MACHINE_TYPE_ATTRIBUTE (<var>type</var>, <var>attributes</var>, <var>identifier</var>, <var>args</var>)</code>
<dd>If defined, a C expression whose value is nonzero if <var>identifier</var> with
arguments <var>args</var> is a valid machine specific attribute for <var>type</var>. 
The attributes in <var>attributes</var> have previously been assigned to <var>type</var>.

<br><dt><code>COMP_TYPE_ATTRIBUTES (<var>type1</var>, <var>type2</var>)</code>
<dd>If defined, a C expression whose value is zero if the attributes on
<var>type1</var> and <var>type2</var> are incompatible, one if they are compatible,
and two if they are nearly compatible (which causes a warning to be
generated).

<br><dt><code>SET_DEFAULT_TYPE_ATTRIBUTES (<var>type</var>)</code>
<dd>If defined, a C statement that assigns default attributes to
newly defined <var>type</var>.

<br><dt><code>MERGE_MACHINE_TYPE_ATTRIBUTES (<var>type1</var>, <var>type2</var>)</code>
<dd>Define this macro if the merging of type attributes needs special handling. 
If defined, the result is a list of the combined TYPE_ATTRIBUTES of
<var>type1</var> and <var>type2</var>.  It is assumed that comptypes has already been
called and returned 1.

<br><dt><code>MERGE_MACHINE_DECL_ATTRIBUTES (<var>olddecl</var>, <var>newdecl</var>)</code>
<dd>Define this macro if the merging of decl attributes needs special handling. 
If defined, the result is a list of the combined DECL_MACHINE_ATTRIBUTES of
<var>olddecl</var> and <var>newdecl</var>.  <var>newdecl</var> is a duplicate declaration
of <var>olddecl</var>.  Examples of when this is needed are when one attribute
overrides another, or when an attribute is nullified by a subsequent
definition.

<br><dt><code>INSERT_ATTRIBUTES (<var>node</var>, <var>attr_ptr</var>, <var>prefix_ptr</var>)</code>
<dd>Define this macro if you want to be able to add attributes to a decl
when it is being created.  This is normally useful for backends which
wish to implement a pragma by using the attributes which correspond to
the pragma's effect.  The <var>node</var> argument is the decl which is being
created.  The <var>attr_ptr</var> argument is a pointer to the attribute list
for this decl.  The <var>prefix_ptr</var> is a pointer to the list of
attributes that have appeared after the specifiers and modifiers of the
declaration, but before the declaration proper.

<br><dt><code>SET_DEFAULT_DECL_ATTRIBUTES (<var>decl</var>, <var>attributes</var>)</code>
<dd>If defined, a C statement that assigns default attributes to
newly defined <var>decl</var>.

<br><dt><code>DOLLARS_IN_IDENTIFIERS</code>
<dd>Define this macro to control use of the character <code>$</code> in identifier
names.  0 means <code>$</code> is not allowed by default; 1 means it is allowed. 
1 is the default; there is no need to define this macro in that case. 
This macro controls the compiler proper; it does not affect the preprocessor.

<br><dt><code>NO_DOLLAR_IN_LABEL</code>
<dd>Define this macro if the assembler does not accept the character
<code>$</code> in label names.  By default constructors and destructors in
G++ have <code>$</code> in the identifiers.  If this macro is defined,
<code>.</code> is used instead.

<br><dt><code>NO_DOT_IN_LABEL</code>
<dd>Define this macro if the assembler does not accept the character
<code>.</code> in label names.  By default constructors and destructors in G++
have names that use <code>.</code>.  If this macro is defined, these names
are rewritten to avoid <code>.</code>.

<br><dt><code>DEFAULT_MAIN_RETURN</code>
<dd>Define this macro if the target system expects every program's <code>main</code>
function to return a standard "success" value by default (if no other
value is explicitly returned).

<p>The definition should be a C statement (sans semicolon) to generate the
appropriate rtl instructions.  It is used only when compiling the end of
<code>main</code>.

<br><dt><code>HAVE_ATEXIT</code>
<dd>Define this if the target system supports the function
<code>atexit</code> from the ANSI C standard.  If this is not defined,
and <code>INIT_SECTION_ASM_OP</code> is not defined, a default
<code>exit</code> function will be provided to support C++.

<br><dt><code>EXIT_BODY</code>
<dd>Define this if your <code>exit</code> function needs to do something
besides calling an external function <code>_cleanup</code> before
terminating with <code>_exit</code>.  The <code>EXIT_BODY</code> macro is
only needed if neither <code>HAVE_ATEXIT</code> nor
<code>INIT_SECTION_ASM_OP</code> are defined.

<br><dt><code>INSN_SETS_ARE_DELAYED (<var>insn</var>)</code>
<dd>Define this macro as a C expression that is nonzero if it is safe for the
delay slot scheduler to place instructions in the delay slot of <var>insn</var>,
even if they appear to use a resource set or clobbered in <var>insn</var>. 
<var>insn</var> is always a <code>jump_insn</code> or an <code>insn</code>; GNU CC knows that
every <code>call_insn</code> has this behavior.  On machines where some <code>insn</code>
or <code>jump_insn</code> is really a function call and hence has this behavior,
you should define this macro.

<p>You need not define this macro if it would always return zero.

<br><dt><code>INSN_REFERENCES_ARE_DELAYED (<var>insn</var>)</code>
<dd>Define this macro as a C expression that is nonzero if it is safe for the
delay slot scheduler to place instructions in the delay slot of <var>insn</var>,
even if they appear to set or clobber a resource referenced in <var>insn</var>. 
<var>insn</var> is always a <code>jump_insn</code> or an <code>insn</code>.  On machines where
some <code>insn</code> or <code>jump_insn</code> is really a function call and its operands
are registers whose use is actually in the subroutine it calls, you should
define this macro.  Doing so allows the delay slot scheduler to move
instructions which copy arguments into the argument registers into the delay
slot of <var>insn</var>.

<p>You need not define this macro if it would always return zero.

<br><dt><code>MACHINE_DEPENDENT_REORG (<var>insn</var>)</code>
<dd>In rare cases, correct code generation requires extra machine
dependent processing between the second jump optimization pass and
delayed branch scheduling.  On those machines, define this macro as a C
statement to act on the code starting at <var>insn</var>.

<br><dt><code>MULTIPLE_SYMBOL_SPACES</code>
<dd>Define this macro if in some cases global symbols from one translation
unit may not be bound to undefined symbols in another translation unit
without user intervention.  For instance, under Microsoft Windows
symbols must be explicitly imported from shared libraries (DLLs).

<br><dt><code>ISSUE_RATE</code>
<dd>A C expression that returns how many instructions can be issued at the
same time if the machine is a superscalar machine.  This is only used by
the <code>Haifa</code> scheduler, and not the traditional scheduler.

<br><dt><code>MD_SCHED_INIT (<var>file</var>, <var>verbose</var>)</code>
<dd>A C statement which is executed by the <code>Haifa</code> scheduler at the
beginning of each block of instructions that are to be scheduled. 
<var>file</var> is either a null pointer, or a stdio stream to write any
debug output to.  <var>verbose</var> is the verbose level provided by
<code>-fsched-verbose-</code><var>n</var>.

<br><dt><code>MD_SCHED_REORDER (<var>file</var>, <var>verbose</var>, <var>ready</var>, <var>n_ready</var>)</code>
<dd>A C statement which is executed by the <code>Haifa</code> scheduler after it
has scheduled the ready list to allow the machine description to reorder
it (for example to combine two small instructions together on
<code>VLIW</code> machines).  <var>file</var> is either a null pointer, or a stdio
stream to write any debug output to.  <var>verbose</var> is the verbose level
provided by <code>-fsched-verbose-</code><var>n</var>.  <var>ready</var> is a pointer to
the ready list of instructions that are ready to be scheduled. 
<var>n_ready</var> is the number of elements in the ready list.  The
scheduler reads the ready list in reverse order, starting with
<var>ready</var>[<var>n_ready</var>-1] and going to <var>ready</var>[0].

<br><dt><code>MD_SCHED_VARIABLE_ISSUE (<var>file</var>, <var>verbose</var>, <var>insn</var>, <var>more</var>)</code>
<dd>A C statement which is executed by the <code>Haifa</code> scheduler after it
has scheduled an insn from the ready list.  <var>file</var> is either a null
pointer, or a stdio stream to write any debug output to.  <var>verbose</var>
is the verbose level provided by <code>-fsched-verbose-</code><var>n</var>. 
<var>insn</var> is the instruction that was scheduled.  <var>more</var> is the
number of instructions that can be issued in the current cycle.  The
<code>MD_SCHED_VARIABLE_ISSUE</code> macro is responsible for updating the
value of <var>more</var> (typically by <var>more</var>-).

<br><dt><code>MAX_INTEGER_COMPUTATION_MODE</code>
<dd>Define this to the largest integer machine mode which can be used for
operations other than load, store and copy operations.

<p>You need only define this macro if the target holds values larger than
<code>word_mode</code> in general purpose registers.  Most targets should not define
this macro.

<br><dt><code>MATH_LIBRARY</code>
<dd>Define this macro as a C string constant for the linker argument to link
in the system math library, or <code>""</code> if the target does not have a
separate math library.

<p>You need only define this macro if the default of <code>"-lm"</code> is wrong.

<h1>The Configuration File</h1>

<p>The configuration file <code>xm-<var>machine</var>.h</code> contains macro
definitions that describe the machine and system on which the compiler
is running, unlike the definitions in <code><var>machine</var>.h</code>, which
describe the machine for which the compiler is producing output.  Most
of the values in <code>xm-<var>machine</var>.h</code> are actually the same on all
machines that GCC runs on, so large parts of all configuration files
are identical.  But there are some macros that vary:

<dl>
<dt><code>USG</code>
<dd>Define this macro if the host system is System V.

<br><dt><code>VMS</code>
<dd>Define this macro if the host system is VMS.

<br><dt><code>FATAL_EXIT_CODE</code>
<dd>A C expression for the status code to be returned when the compiler
exits after serious errors.

<br><dt><code>SUCCESS_EXIT_CODE</code>
<dd>A C expression for the status code to be returned when the compiler
exits without serious errors.

<br><dt><code>HOST_WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN</code>
<dd>Defined if the host machine stores words of multi-word values in
big-endian order.  (GCC does not depend on the host byte ordering
within a word.)

<br><dt><code>HOST_FLOAT_WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN</code>
<dd>Define this macro to be 1 if the host machine stores <code>DFmode</code>,
<code>XFmode</code> or <code>TFmode</code> floating point numbers in memory with the
word containing the sign bit at the lowest address; otherwise, define it
to be zero.

<p>This macro need not be defined if the ordering is the same as for
multi-word integers.

<br><dt><code>HOST_FLOAT_FORMAT</code>
<dd>A numeric code distinguishing the floating point format for the host
machine.  See <code>TARGET_FLOAT_FORMAT</code> in <a href="#Storage%20Layout">Storage Layout</a> for the
alternatives and default.

<br><dt><code>HOST_BITS_PER_CHAR</code>
<dd>A C expression for the number of bits in <code>char</code> on the host
machine.

<br><dt><code>HOST_BITS_PER_SHORT</code>
<dd>A C expression for the number of bits in <code>short</code> on the host
machine.

<br><dt><code>HOST_BITS_PER_INT</code>
<dd>A C expression for the number of bits in <code>int</code> on the host
machine.

<br><dt><code>HOST_BITS_PER_LONG</code>
<dd>A C expression for the number of bits in <code>long</code> on the host
machine.

<br><dt><code>ONLY_INT_FIELDS</code>
<dd>Define this macro to indicate that the host compiler only supports
<code>int</code> bit fields, rather than other integral types, including
<code>enum</code>, as do most C compilers.

<br><dt><code>OBSTACK_CHUNK_SIZE</code>
<dd>A C expression for the size of ordinary obstack chunks. 
If you don't define this, a usually-reasonable default is used.

<br><dt><code>OBSTACK_CHUNK_ALLOC</code>
<dd>The function used to allocate obstack chunks. 
If you don't define this, <code>xmalloc</code> is used.

<br><dt><code>OBSTACK_CHUNK_FREE</code>
<dd>The function used to free obstack chunks. 
If you don't define this, <code>free</code> is used.

<br><dt><code>USE_C_ALLOCA</code>
<dd>Define this macro to indicate that the compiler is running with the
<code>alloca</code> implemented in C.  This version of <code>alloca</code> can be
found in the file <code>alloca.c</code>; to use it, you must also alter the
<code>Makefile</code> variable <code>ALLOCA</code>.  (This is done automatically
for the systems on which we know it is needed.)

<p>If you do define this macro, you should probably do it as follows:

<pre>#ifndef __GNUC__
#define USE_C_ALLOCA
#else
#define alloca __builtin_alloca
#endif
</pre>

<p>so that when the compiler is compiled with GCC it uses the more
efficient built-in <code>alloca</code> function.

<br><dt><code>FUNCTION_CONVERSION_BUG</code>
<dd>Define this macro to indicate that the host compiler does not properly
handle converting a function value to a pointer-to-function when it is
used in an expression.

<br><dt><code>MULTIBYTE_CHARS</code>
<dd>Define this macro to enable support for multibyte characters in the
input to GCC.  This requires that the host system support the ANSI C
library functions for converting multibyte characters to wide
characters.

<br><dt><code>POSIX</code>
<dd>Define this if your system is POSIX.1 compliant.

<br><dt><code>NO_SYS_SIGLIST</code>
<dd>Define this if your system <em>does not</em> provide the variable
<code>sys_siglist</code>.

<p>Some systems do provide this variable, but with a different name such
as <code>_sys_siglist</code>.  On these systems, you can define
<code>sys_siglist</code> as a macro which expands into the name actually
provided.

<p>Autoconf normally defines <code>SYS_SIGLIST_DECLARED</code> when it finds a
declaration of <code>sys_siglist</code> in the system header files. 
However, when you define <code>sys_siglist</code> to a different name
autoconf will not automatically define <code>SYS_SIGLIST_DECLARED</code>. 
Therefore, if you define <code>sys_siglist</code>, you should also define
<code>SYS_SIGLIST_DECLARED</code>.

<br><dt><code>USE_PROTOTYPES</code>
<dd>Define this to be 1 if you know that the host compiler supports
prototypes, even if it doesn't define __STDC__, or define
it to be 0 if you do not want any prototypes used in compiling
GCC.  If <code>USE_PROTOTYPES</code> is not defined, it will be
determined automatically whether your compiler supports
prototypes by checking if <code>__STDC__</code> is defined.

<br><dt><code>NO_MD_PROTOTYPES</code>
<dd>Define this if you wish suppression of prototypes generated from
the machine description file, but to use other prototypes within
GCC.  If <code>USE_PROTOTYPES</code> is defined to be 0, or the
host compiler does not support prototypes, this macro has no
effect.

<br><dt><code>MD_CALL_PROTOTYPES</code>
<dd>Define this if you wish to generate prototypes for the
<code>gen_call</code> or <code>gen_call_value</code> functions generated from
the machine description file.  If <code>USE_PROTOTYPES</code> is
defined to be 0, or the host compiler does not support
prototypes, or <code>NO_MD_PROTOTYPES</code> is defined, this macro has
no effect.  As soon as all of the machine descriptions are
modified to have the appropriate number of arguments, this macro
will be removed.

<br><dt><code>PATH_SEPARATOR</code>
<dd>Define this macro to be a C character constant representing the
character used to separate components in paths.  The default value is
the colon character

<br><dt><code>DIR_SEPARATOR</code>
<dd>If your system uses some character other than slash to separate
directory names within a file specification, define this macro to be a C
character constant specifying that character.  When GCC displays file
names, the character you specify will be used.  GCC will test for
both slash and the character you specify when parsing filenames.

<br><dt><code>OBJECT_SUFFIX</code>
<dd>Define this macro to be a C string representing the suffix for object
files on your machine.  If you do not define this macro, GCC will use
<code>.o</code> as the suffix for object files.

<br><dt><code>EXECUTABLE_SUFFIX</code>
<dd>Define this macro to be a C string representing the suffix for executable
files on your machine.  If you do not define this macro, GCC will use
the null string as the suffix for object files.

<br><dt><code>COLLECT_EXPORT_LIST</code>
<dd>If defined, <code>collect2</code> will scan the individual object files
specified on its command line and create an export list for the linker. 
Define this macro for systems like AIX, where the linker discards
object files that are not referenced from <code>main</code> and uses export
lists. 
</dl>

<p>In addition, configuration files for system V define <code>bcopy</code>,
<code>bzero</code> and <code>bcmp</code> as aliases.  Some files define <code>alloca</code>
as a macro when compiled with GCC, in order to take advantage of the
benefit of GCC's built-in <code>alloca</code>.

<h1>Makefile Fragments</h1>

<p>When you configure GCC using the <code>configure</code> script
(see <a href="#Installation">Installation</a>), it will construct the file <code>Makefile</code> from
the template file <code>Makefile.in</code>.  When it does this, it will
incorporate makefile fragment files from the <code>config</code> directory,
named <code>t-<var>target</var></code> and <code>x-<var>host</var></code>.  If these files do
not exist, it means nothing needs to be added for a given target or
host.

<h2>The Target Makefile Fragment</h2>

<p>The target makefile fragment, <code>t-<var>target</var></code>, defines special
target dependent variables and targets used in the <code>Makefile</code>:

<dl>
<dt><code>LIBGCC1</code>
<dd>The rule to use to build <code>libgcc1.a</code>. 
If your target does not need to use the functions in <code>libgcc1.a</code>,
set this to empty. 
See <a href="#Interface">Interface</a>.

<br><dt><code>CROSS_LIBGCC1</code>
<dd>The rule to use to build <code>libgcc1.a</code> when building a cross
compiler.  If your target does not need to use the functions in
<code>libgcc1.a</code>, set this to empty.  See <a href="#Cross%20Runtime">Cross Runtime</a>.

<br><dt><code>LIBGCC2_CFLAGS</code>
<dd>Compiler flags to use when compiling <code>libgcc2.c</code>.

<br><dt><code>LIB2FUNCS_EXTRA</code>
<dd>A list of source file names to be compiled or assembled and inserted
into <code>libgcc.a</code>.

<br><dt><code>CRTSTUFF_T_CFLAGS</code>
<dd>Special flags used when compiling <code>crtstuff.c</code>. 
See <a href="#Initialization">Initialization</a>.

<br><dt><code>CRTSTUFF_T_CFLAGS_S</code>
<dd>Special flags used when compiling <code>crtstuff.c</code> for shared
linking.  Used if you use <code>crtbeginS.o</code> and <code>crtendS.o</code>
in <code>EXTRA-PARTS</code>. 
See <a href="#Initialization">Initialization</a>.

<br><dt><code>MULTILIB_OPTIONS</code>
<dd>For some targets, invoking GCC in different ways produces objects
that can not be linked together.  For example, for some targets GCC
produces both big and little endian code.  For these targets, you must
arrange for multiple versions of <code>libgcc.a</code> to be compiled, one for
each set of incompatible options.  When GCC invokes the linker, it
arranges to link in the right version of <code>libgcc.a</code>, based on
the command line options used.

<p>The <code>MULTILIB_OPTIONS</code> macro lists the set of options for which
special versions of <code>libgcc.a</code> must be built.  Write options that
are mutually incompatible side by side, separated by a slash.  Write
options that may be used together separated by a space.  The build
procedure will build all combinations of compatible options.

<p>For example, if you set <code>MULTILIB_OPTIONS</code> to <code>m68000/m68020
msoft-float</code>, <code>Makefile</code> will build special versions of
<code>libgcc.a</code> using the following sets of options:  <code>-m68000</code>,
<code>-m68020</code>, <code>-msoft-float</code>, <code>-m68000 -msoft-float</code>, and
<code>-m68020 -msoft-float</code>.

<br><dt><code>MULTILIB_DIRNAMES</code>
<dd>If <code>MULTILIB_OPTIONS</code> is used, this variable specifies the
directory names that should be used to hold the various libraries. 
Write one element in <code>MULTILIB_DIRNAMES</code> for each element in
<code>MULTILIB_OPTIONS</code>.  If <code>MULTILIB_DIRNAMES</code> is not used, the
default value will be <code>MULTILIB_OPTIONS</code>, with all slashes treated
as spaces.

<p>For example, if <code>MULTILIB_OPTIONS</code> is set to <code>m68000/m68020
msoft-float</code>, then the default value of <code>MULTILIB_DIRNAMES</code> is
<code>m68000 m68020 msoft-float</code>.  You may specify a different value if
you desire a different set of directory names.

<br><dt><code>MULTILIB_MATCHES</code>
<dd>Sometimes the same option may be written in two different ways.  If an
option is listed in <code>MULTILIB_OPTIONS</code>, GCC needs to know about
any synonyms.  In that case, set <code>MULTILIB_MATCHES</code> to a list of
items of the form <code>option=option</code> to describe all relevant
synonyms.  For example, <code>m68000=mc68000 m68020=mc68020</code>.

<br><dt><code>MULTILIB_EXCEPTIONS</code>
<dd>Sometimes when there are multiple sets of <code>MULTILIB_OPTIONS</code> being
specified, there are combinations that should not be built.  In that
case, set <code>MULTILIB_EXCEPTIONS</code> to be all of the switch exceptions
in shell case syntax that should not be built.

<p>For example, in the PowerPC embedded ABI support, it was not desirable
to build libraries that compiled with the <code>-mcall-aixdesc</code> option
and either of the <code>-mcall-aixdesc</code> or <code>-mlittle</code> options at
the same time, and therefore <code>MULTILIB_EXCEPTIONS</code> is set to
<code>*mrelocatable/*mcall-aixdesc* *mlittle/*mcall-aixdesc*</code>.

<br><dt><code>MULTILIB_EXTRA_OPTS</code>
<dd>Sometimes it is desirable that when building multiple versions of
<code>libgcc.a</code> certain options should always be passed on to the
compiler.  In that case, set <code>MULTILIB_EXTRA_OPTS</code> to be the list
of options to be used for all builds.

<h1>Funding Free Software</h1>

<p>If you want to have more free software a few years from now, it makes
sense for you to help encourage people to contribute funds for its
development.  The most effective approach known is to encourage
commercial redistributors to donate.

<p>Users of free software systems can boost the pace of development by
encouraging for-a-fee distributors to donate part of their selling price
to free software developers--the Free Software Foundation, and others.

<p>The way to convince distributors to do this is to demand it and expect
it from them.  So when you compare distributors, judge them partly by
how much they give to free software development.  Show distributors
they must compete to be the one who gives the most.

<p>To make this approach work, you must insist on numbers that you can
compare, such as, "We will donate ten dollars to the Frobnitz project
for each disk sold."  Don't be satisfied with a vague promise, such as
"A portion of the profits are donated," since it doesn't give a basis
for comparison.

<p>Even a precise fraction "of the profits from this disk" is not very
meaningful, since creative accounting and unrelated business decisions
can greatly alter what fraction of the sales price counts as profit. 
If the price you pay is $50, ten percent of the profit is probably
less than a dollar; it might be a few cents, or nothing at all.

<p>Some redistributors do development work themselves.  This is useful too;
but to keep everyone honest, you need to inquire how much they do, and
what kind.  Some kinds of development make much more long-term
difference than others.  For example, maintaining a separate version of
a program contributes very little; maintaining the standard version of a
program for the whole community contributes much.  Easy new ports
contribute little, since someone else would surely do them; difficult
ports such as adding a new CPU to the GNU Compiler Collection contribute more;
major new features or packages contribute the most.

<p>By establishing the idea that supporting further development is "the
proper thing to do" when distributing free software for a fee, we can
assure a steady flow of resources into making more free software.

<h1>Linux and the GNU Project</h1>

<p>Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every
day, without realizing it.  Through a peculiar turn of events, the
version of GNU which is widely used today is more often known as
"Linux", and many users are not aware of the extent of its
connection with the GNU Project.

<p>There really is a Linux; it is a kernel, and these people are using
it.  But you can't use a kernel by itself; a kernel is useful only as
part of a whole system.  The system in which Linux is typically used
is a modified variant of the GNU system--in other words, a Linux-based
GNU system.

<p>Many users are not fully aware of the distinction between the kernel,
which is Linux, and the whole system, which they also call "Linux". 
The ambiguous use of the name doesn't promote understanding.

<p>Programmers generally know that Linux is a kernel.  But since they
have generally heard the whole system called "Linux" as well, they
often envisage a history which fits that name.  For example, many
believe that once Linus Torvalds finished writing the kernel, his
friends looked around for other free software, and for no particular
reason most everything necessary to make a Unix-like system was
already available.

<p>What they found was no accident--it was the GNU system.  The available
free software added up to a complete system because the GNU Project
had been working since 1984 to make one.  The GNU Manifesto
had set forth the goal of developing a free Unix-like system, called
GNU.  By the time Linux was written, the system was almost finished.

<p>Most free software projects have the goal of developing a particular
program for a particular job.  For example, Linus Torvalds set out to
write a Unix-like kernel (Linux); Donald Knuth set out to write a text
formatter (TeX); Bob Scheifler set out to develop a window system (X
Windows).  It's natural to measure the contribution of this kind of
project by specific programs that came from the project.

<p>If we tried to measure the GNU Project's contribution in this way,
what would we conclude?  One CD-ROM vendor found that in their "Linux
distribution", GNU software was the largest single contingent, around
28% of the total source code, and this included some of the essential
major components without which there could be no system.  Linux itself
was about 3%.  So if you were going to pick a name for the system
based on who wrote the programs in the system, the most appropriate
single choice would be "GNU".

<p>But we don't think that is the right way to consider the question. 
The GNU Project was not, is not, a project to develop specific
software packages.  It was not a project to develop a C compiler,
although we did.  It was not a project to develop a text editor,
although we developed one.  The GNU Project's aim was to develop
<em>a complete free Unix-like system</em>.

<p>Many people have made major contributions to the free software in the
system, and they all deserve credit.  But the reason it is <em>a
system</em>--and not just a collection of useful programs--is because the
GNU Project set out to make it one.  We wrote the programs that were
needed to make a <em>complete</em> free system.  We wrote essential but
unexciting major components, such as the assembler and linker, because
you can't have a system without them.  A complete system needs more
than just programming tools, so we wrote other components as well,
such as the Bourne Again SHell, the PostScript interpreter
Ghostscript, and the GNU C library.

<p>By the early 90s we had put together the whole system aside from the
kernel (and we were also working on a kernel, the GNU Hurd, which runs
on top of Mach).  Developing this kernel has been a lot harder than we
expected, and we are still working on finishing it.

<p>Fortunately, you don't have to wait for it, because Linux is working
now.  When Linus Torvalds wrote Linux, he filled the last major gap. 
People could then put Linux together with the GNU system to make a
complete free system: a Linux-based GNU system (or GNU/Linux system,
for short).

<p>Putting them together sounds simple, but it was not a trivial job. 
The GNU C library (called glibc for short) needed substantial changes. 
Integrating a complete system as a distribution that would work "out
of the box" was a big job, too.  It required addressing the issue of
how to install and boot the system--a problem we had not tackled,
because we hadn't yet reached that point.  The people who developed
the various system distributions made a substantial contribution.

<p>The GNU Project supports GNU/Linux systems as well as <em>the</em>
GNU system--even with funds.  We funded the rewriting of the
Linux-related extensions to the GNU C library, so that now they are
well integrated, and the newest GNU/Linux systems use the current
library release with no changes.  We also funded an early stage of the
development of Debian GNU/Linux.

<p>We use Linux-based GNU systems today for most of our work, and we hope
you use them too.  But please don't confuse the public by using the
name "Linux" ambiguously.  Linux is the kernel, one of the essential
major components of the system.  The system as a whole is more or less
the GNU system.

<h1>GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</h1>

<p align="center">Version 2, June 1991</p>

<pre>Copyright &copy; 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307, USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
</pre>

<h2>Preamble</h2>

<p>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

<p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

<p>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. 
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

<p>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

<p>We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

<p>Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

<p>Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

<p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

<p align="center">TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</p>

<ol type=1 start=0>
</p><li>This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

<p>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). 
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

</p><li>You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

<p>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

</p><li>You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

<ol type=a start=1>
<li>You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

<li>You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
parties under the terms of this License.

<li>If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
</ol>

<p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

<p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

<p>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

</p><li>You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

<ol type=a start=1>
<li>Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

<li>Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
customarily used for software interchange; or,

<li>Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
received the program in object code or executable form with such
an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
</ol>

<p>The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

<p>If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

</p><li>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. 
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

<li>You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

<li>Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. 
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

<li>If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

<p>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

<p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

<p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

</p><li>If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

<li>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

<p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

</p><li>If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

<p align="center">NO WARRANTY</p>

<li>BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

<li>IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
</ol>

<p align="center">END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p>

<h2>How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</h2>

<p>If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

<p>To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

<pre><var>one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.</var>
Copyright (C) <var>yyyy</var>  <var>name of author</var>

This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
(at your option) any later version.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
GNU General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307, USA.
</pre>

<p>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

<p>If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

<pre>Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) <var>yyyy</var> <var>name of author</var>
Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details
type `show w'.
This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
</pre>

<p>The hypothetical commands <code>show w</code> and <code>show c</code> should show
the appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the
commands you use may be called something other than <code>show w</code> and
<code>show c</code>; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever
suits your program.

<p>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

<pre>Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
`Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

<var>signature of Ty Coon</var>, 1 April 1989
Ty Coon, President of Vice
</pre>

<p>This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
Public License instead of this License.

<h1>Contributors to GCC</h1>

<p>In addition to Richard Stallman, several people have written parts
of GCC.

<ul>
<li>The idea of using RTL and some of the optimization ideas came from the
program PO written at the University of Arizona by Jack Davidson and
Christopher Fraser.  See "Register Allocation and Exhaustive Peephole
Optimization", Software Practice and Experience 14 (9), Sept. 1984,
857-866.

<li>Paul Rubin wrote most of the preprocessor.

<li>Leonard Tower wrote parts of the parser, RTL generator, and RTL
definitions, and of the Vax machine description.

<li>Ted Lemon wrote parts of the RTL reader and printer.

<li>Jim Wilson implemented loop strength reduction and some other
loop optimizations.

<li>Nobuyuki Hikichi of Software Research Associates, Tokyo, contributed
the support for the Sony NEWS machine.

<li>Charles LaBrec contributed the support for the Integrated Solutions
68020 system.

<li>Michael Tiemann of Cygnus Support wrote the front end for C++, as well
as the support for inline functions and instruction scheduling.  Also
the descriptions of the National Semiconductor 32000 series cpu, the
SPARC cpu and part of the Motorola 88000 cpu.

<li>Gerald Baumgartner added the signature extension to the C++ front-end.

<li>Jan Stein of the Chalmers Computer Society provided support for
Genix, as well as part of the 32000 machine description.

<li>Alex Crain provided changes for the 3b1.

<li>Greg Satz and Chris Hanson assisted in making GCC work on HP-UX for
the 9000 series 300.

<li>William Schelter did most of the work on the Intel 80386 support.

<li>Christopher Smith did the port for Convex machines.

<li>Paul Petersen wrote the machine description for the Alliant FX/8.

<li>Dario Dariol contributed the four varieties of sample programs
that print a copy of their source.

<li>Alain Lichnewsky ported GCC to the Mips cpu.

<li>Devon Bowen, Dale Wiles and Kevin Zachmann ported GCC to the Tahoe.

<li>Jonathan Stone wrote the machine description for the Pyramid computer.

<li>Gary Miller ported GCC to Charles River Data Systems machines.

<li>Richard Kenner of the New York University Ultracomputer Research
Laboratory wrote the machine descriptions for the AMD 29000, the DEC
Alpha, the IBM RT PC, and the IBM RS/6000 as well as the support for
instruction attributes.  He also made changes to better support RISC
processors including changes to common subexpression elimination,
strength reduction, function calling sequence handling, and condition
code support, in addition to generalizing the code for frame pointer
elimination.

<li>Richard Kenner and Michael Tiemann jointly developed reorg.c, the delay
slot scheduler.

<li>Mike Meissner and Tom Wood of Data General finished the port to the
Motorola 88000.

<li>Masanobu Yuhara of Fujitsu Laboratories implemented the machine
description for the Tron architecture (specifically, the Gmicro).

<li>NeXT, Inc. donated the front end that supports the Objective C
language.

<li>James van Artsdalen wrote the code that makes efficient use of
the Intel 80387 register stack.

<li>Mike Meissner at the Open Software Foundation finished the port to the
MIPS cpu, including adding ECOFF debug support, and worked on the
Intel port for the Intel 80386 cpu.  Later at Cygnus Support, he worked
on the rs6000 and PowerPC ports.

<li>Ron Guilmette implemented the <code>protoize</code> and <code>unprotoize</code>
tools, the support for Dwarf symbolic debugging information, and much of
the support for System V Release 4.  He has also worked heavily on the
Intel 386 and 860 support.

<li>Torbjorn Granlund implemented multiply- and divide-by-constant
optimization, improved long long support, and improved leaf function
register allocation.

<li>Mike Stump implemented the support for Elxsi 64 bit CPU.

<li>John Wehle added the machine description for the Western Electric 32000
processor used in several 3b series machines (no relation to the
National Semiconductor 32000 processor).

<li>Holger Teutsch provided the support for the Clipper cpu.

<li>Kresten Krab Thorup wrote the run time support for the Objective C
language.

<li>Stephen Moshier contributed the floating point emulator that assists in
cross-compilation and permits support for floating point numbers wider
than 64 bits.

<li>David Edelsohn contributed the changes to RS/6000 port to make it
support the PowerPC and POWER2 architectures.

<li>Steve Chamberlain wrote the support for the Hitachi SH processor.

<li>Peter Schauer wrote the code to allow debugging to work on the Alpha.

<li>Oliver M. Kellogg of Deutsche Aerospace contributed the port to the
MIL-STD-1750A.

<ol type="1">
<li><a name="fn-1"></a>
<p>The analogous feature in
Fortran is called an assigned goto, but that name seems inappropriate in
C, where one can do more than simply store label addresses in label
variables.</p>

<li><a name="fn-2"></a>
<p>A file's <dfn>basename</dfn>
was the name stripped of all leading path information and of trailing
suffixes, such as <code>.h</code> or <code>.C</code> or <code>.cc</code>.</p>
